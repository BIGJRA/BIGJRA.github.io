# .Karma Files (Renegade)

We are now going to begin the new content!

Head into the League Administration and talk to Erin in the middle room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Do what? (Neutral)
- Time to awaken Adrest. (Neutral)
- Your hair is nice today. (+1 Erin)

Accept the fast travel to the Field of Pillars and talk to the Obelisk to enter Zeight. Attempt to awaken Adrest above, then head up.

!battle(["Crescent",:INTERCEPTOR,0], "Deep Earth Field")

!move("CHTHONICMALADY")

Now that we're officially on the Renegade Route, no more battle advice for you. Get good!

After you win, wake up Adrest, then head up and around in this bizarre place.

You'll find yourself playing as the original Interceptor once more, in a cold, grey, mysterious world. Exit the train station, go down to board the train, and enter the statue on the right to proceed. After the loop, go right and up.

Once you're back at the Obelisk, reenter. Back in Grand Dream City, enter the penthouse and talk to M2 on the top floor.

Before we accept the request of M2 to join Venam in Grand Dream City and continue .Karma Files... there are a bunch of sidequests that have opened up! Legendary ones!

## Legendary Quests (Renegade)

While we're in Sashila Village, a new in-game trade has opened up. A girl is at the bottom of the village, just to the right of the bottom-rightmost house. She wants our Toxapex in exchange for a **Magikarp (Aevian)** named Hot Dog! How nice. Talk to the very same Toxapex afterward to give it a small loan of $100,000 to get *10 Pearls*, *3 Big Pearls*, a *Pearl String*, and the *Toxtricitite*!

Head to Route 4 next. Cairo now has one final crest he'll sell us for 14K Red Essence!

!shop("Cairoâ€™s Shop New Items (15 Badges)", [["Delcatty Crest", "14000 Red Essences"]])

Head into any Luck's Tent location. There is a new move tutor: 

!tutor("Macbeth Move Tutor", [["Cosmic Power", "5 Yellow Shards"], ["Leaf Blade", "5 Green Shards"], ["Toxic Spikes", "6 Blue Shards"], ["Aura Sphere", "6 Red Shards"], ["Heavy Slam", "6 Blue Shards"], ["Heat Crash", "5 Red Shards"], ["Gunk Shot", "5 Green Shards"], ["Pollen Puff", "5 Green Shards"], ["Terrain Pulse", "6 Yellow Shards"]])

There's one more Move Tutor we can now access as well. Fly over to the Kingdom of Goomidra. In a house on the west side:

!tutor("Goombina Move Tutor", [["Draco Meteor", "1 Balm Mushroom"]])

Fly to Eclysia Pyramid and talk to Ryland on the summit. You'll get the *Steelixite*!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Ryland at Eclysia Skyview (+6 Ryland)

Make your way over to Axis High University. On the grounds in front of the school you'll see a green butterfly. Talk to it for a spirit battle.

!dbattle(["Xara",:SPIRITXARA,0], ["Jean",:SPIRITJEAN,0], "City Field")

This a very tough fight on a tough field. This is our first 12v6 in this game, and Spirit Xara and Jean pull no punches. They each have two Crest Pokemon, a Z-Move, and a Mega Evolution. Their Pokemon are all across the stat spectrum and all across the typing spectrum, so there's not really one particular strategy that works here. The Delcatty literally gets +110% to each stat thanks to its Crest on the first turn... imagine my surprise figuring out how to finally take Delcatty out only to realize there were 11 more Pokemon waiting to take me on.

One piece of good news is that there are only a few spread moves, so using Protect to counter the AI can help you get momentum. You really want to focus on crippling or taking out Delcatty first, then focusing on the rest of the team later on. Dragapult's screens are very annoying - if you can get rid of those and get a Pokemon some SpA boosts and let it spam Hyper Voice or Blizzard, you are generally going to be set with the right allies to support.

Win this very difficult battle to get *5 Blue Shards*, *5 Red Shards*, *5 Green Shards*, *5 Black Prisms*, *5 Exp. Candy XL*, as well as the *Copperajite* and *Beedrillite*!

Oh, by the way. If you managed to grind all the way up to 999 Black Prisms, you can get **Necrozma** by asking Mr. Luck for ??? and going to Rhodea's Penthouse. Have fun with that.

### Legendary Wings (Renegade)

Talk to the scientist with the hood in the League Administration to get the *Legendary Wings* quest. 

First, fly over to Evergreen Island. All the way on the southeast side of Route 11 is the Seabound Cave East; climb the stairs outside on its island to catch **Articuno**!

Next, fly over to Goldenleaf Town and head west to Goldenwood Forest. Cross the easternmost land bridge to catch **Zapdos**!

Finally, fly over to Teila Resort and follow the path through the Magrodar Crater. Catch **Moltres**!

Return to the scientist to finish this quest.

### Vivian's Regret (Renegade)

Fly to Sheridan and enter Carotos Mountain. Make your way through the Corrupted Cave to the Garufa Sanctuary. 

Inside the sanctuary, you'll see various Darchlight Crystals scattered about. Talk to each one of them to view a scene - eventually a glowing door in the left wing of the area will be unlocked. Head in, read the book, and show a Water type to the statue in order to activate one more Darchlight Crystal at the entrance. View that one, then head towards where we fought Groudon. Smash this Darchlight Crystal and enter the teleporter.

Step on the seven tiles in the next room to catch **Regirock**!

Nymiera will unlock one more seal and warp you to the door, so go up.

!boss("ADMIN", "Deep Earth Field")

Here's the thing: the way the boss's shields work means you cannot defeat it. The game does not expect you to defeat it. If you manage to break its shield 100 times though, the game rewards you by telling you you're wasting your time and treating it as a loss anyways! How to accomplish this, I leave as an exercise to the reader.

Destroy the terminal, or don't, then head out of this room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- After destroying the terminal: "Envoys were mistreated" (Neutral)
- After destroying the terminal: "Save Aelita from her fate" (Neutral)
- After destroying the terminal: "To Destroy Earth" (-999 Nymiera)
- After destroying the terminal: "To spite Admin" (-999 Nymiera)

That wraps up this quest!

### Anju's Quest (Renegade)

Next, fly to Kristiline and make your way through the Church of Theolia portal to reach the Tower Cellar. Make your way through the wall in order to reach the room that is directly on the right of the entrance - you need to exit the wall, go right, then go right and up in the next room to accomplish this. Use the Darchlight Crystal to create a bridge, then walk into the rift in the next room.

To the right in the Crystal Fairytale area, you'll find the *Icium-Z*! Talk to Anju above, then her mother. Talk to Anju again, then find her at the top right for a third conversation. Pick up her Lillipup in the bottom left corner and return to Anju. Finally, head up for a battle.

!battle(["Anju",:ICEHEIRESS,0], "Fairy Tale Arena")

Use a Magical Seed or two if you get stuck!

Finally, head up once more to view the scene. You can catch **Regice**!

View one more scene and depart.

### Heart of Iron (Renegade)

Fly over to Route 9 and make your way over to the Axis High University. Enter the Axis Factory and enter the room immediately on the right and enter the rift.

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,10], "Short-Circuit Field")

This area is rather annoying: you can turn on the lights using a few switches scattered about, but they will automatically shut off shortly after. Try to get a glimpse of the floor tiles before the light goes off to figure out where you are as you traverse and defeat copies of the above Defense Mechanisms. Or, you can use my picture guide to keep your sanity:

!img("calgearn.png")

The five people we need to find are located at the tiles circled in pink. You can use a teleporter to reach a *Black Prism* (A) and pick up the *Dubious Disc* (B) and *Ancient Teachings* (C) in a bottom right room. 

Once you have gathered the entire group, enter the door at the top right.

!boss("KKING", "Short-Circuit Field")

Easy boss, easy life. Not so much for Clover, though. Capture **Registeel** then take the teleporter and rift to exit.

### Parks and Wrecks (Renegade)

For our next quest, fly over to East Gearen City. Make your way to the left backroom of the Lab to talk to Adrienn if you have completed *Reborn Again* and the Neo East Gearen Help Quests to begin a new quest: *Parks and Wrecks*.

Head over to the Magnolia Library, cut the nearby tree, and talk to Adrienn, Aya, and Jan then enter. Inside, talk to the poster in the back to discover a secret path! Follow it and take the elevator.

To the right you can read a journal. Do the same to the left, then interact with the panel to lower the shutter downstairs.

If Florin is alive:

!battle(["Dr. Jenkel",:MADSCIENTIST,1], "Flower Garden Field")

This fight can catch you off guard - Alcremie and Musharna have decent synergy with the double-field combo of Misty Terrain overlaying Flower Garden Field. Hitting them with super-effective Physical moves is generally going to help you out here: Fire, Poison, and Steel in particular. The Ariados with Crest is a bit of a wildcard but you should be able to take it out with a super-effective move, too.

If Florin is dead:

!battle(["Mr. Hynde",:DIABOLICALGENIUS,1], "Flower Garden Field")

You'll be able to capture **Shaymin** above!

Return to Gearen Lab and talk to Adrienn. That concludes *Parks and Wrecks*!

## Missing Children 3 (Renegade)

Fly over to Kristiline Town and enter Dylan's house if you have progressed *Missing Children* up to this point.

Head upstairs and talk to the statue, then go underground downstairs.

Talk to Ana to go to the 3rd Layer. Enter the building to the right. After a chat upstairs, head west across the bridge outside and enter the small building above. Pick up the *H-Disk* in the next room and use the teleporter.

Return to Dylan's house, then head over to the lift in the Underground. Use the H-Disk on the nearby machine to go down. Head up to take part in the "game".

The game explains it: every trainer you fight is one you will cause to be erased. A kill counter will be kept, though.

Up from the start:

!battle(["Tinia",:COOLTRAINER_F,0])

Right and down from here:

!battle(["Marsie",:LASS,0])

Down from here, a trainer will simply forfeit. Up and left from this room:

!battle(["Donovan",:COOLGUY,0])

Left from this room:

!battle(["Jordy",:YOUNGSTER,0])

Go right then down to cross the bridge with the others. Once you regain control, go right twice then up to reach the Key Bearer. Talk to them, then return to the door and go up when you are ready for a gauntlet of 2-3 fights! The gauntlet is only against 3 Pokemon... 3 BOSS Pokemon, that is, so prepare your team well.

!boss("NANODRIVE", "Colosseum Field")

She can set up quickly and steamroll you, but effects like Paralysis and dropped speed stick around. Lower her speed and cripple her to win.

!boss("NANODRIVE_1", "Colosseum Field")

One more fight. She'll try to hammer you with powerful Protean attacks, especially after an Omniboost on its last stage. Paralysis and Priority moves will be a great help here.

If you press V to give Ana back, you'll have to fight her as well:

!battle(["V",:INTERCEPTORV,0], "Colosseum Field")

The game keeps track of whether or not you win this fight, but winning is not required. If you do want to win, Trick Room on the first turn plus a few powerful Ground moves will easily do the trick.

Enter Dylan's house, then Peony's, then Particia's (downstairs).

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Peony sent me here. (Neutral)
- I wanted to check in! => Peony sent me. (Neutral)
- I wanted to check in! => It's true! Peony also sent me (+3 Particia)

Finally, return to Dylan's house. On the table is **Deino**! That's it for *Missing Children*!

## Continuing .Karma Files (Renegade)

That wraps up all the sidequest and legendary acquisition for the time being.

Back in the Dream District, talk to M2 and Venam outside Mika's Cafe. Follow them to the Back Alley. Talk to them, and the uh..... PINK MAN. will get robbed. Chase his thief to the very bottom of Dream District South for a battle.

!battle(["Kageyama",:TOURIST,1], "City Field")

Holy crap, this is the same guy that was blocking the bridge in East Gearen all the way at the beginning of the game.

Once you finally regain control, head over to the Field of Pillars and enter Zeight.

### .Hit List: Karrina

You only get this section if Karrina is alive. You get to choose who sends a letter to Karrina, you, Karen, or M2. Tell M2 you are ready to go.

Below you will spawn a *Poke Toy*. Head up.

!battle(["Marena",:LASS,1], "Desert Field")

!battle(["Joe",:COOLTRAINER_M,1], "Desert Field")

Finally:

!battle(["Karrina",:GANGLEADER,3], "Desert Field")

She even stole Karen's Diancie. How rude! Karrina has good synergy with the desert field, but you too can make use of boosted Fire and Ground moves to emerge victorious.

In the game show, you get to vote: "GUILTY" "or" "NAH". You will receive the *Goocci Bag* and more importantly **Diancie**! Let's go!

### Chasing Uxie

Head on back to the Zeight. Accept M2's request to head to Aquamarine Cave and dive down.

!boss("UXIEBAD", "Cave Field")

You'll get a *Red Gem*!

Head back to the Obelisk and go to Zeight.

### .Hit List: Ren

Once you have control in the Dream Dream, go up. You'll fight M2 twice, in Singles and Doubles.

!battle(["M2",:TRAINER_M2,0], "City Field")

The gazebo Pokeball is a trap!

!battle(["Ren",:OUTCAST,8], "City Field")

You will get *Robo Ren's Cloak*... and more importantly, the **Genesect** contained inside!

Back in Sashila, enter the first room.

### Chasing Azelf & Mesprit

Fly over to Yui's Ranch and take a Braviary to Honec Woods. Exit Honec Woods to the west to reach the area with the Azelf Statue. Walk towards the shining star to reach the Den of Valor (not to be confused with Valor Mountain, of course).

**ZCell 142: Den of Valor**

!img("zcell142.png")

!boss("AZELFBAD", "Cave Field")

You will get another *Red Gem*. Back in Honec Woods, go right and talk to Clear.

Back in the Zeight, talk to the computer to get the next target. Fly to Gearen and head to Goldenwood Forest. Surf up at the very top to reach the Den of Verity, and fight Mesprit.

!boss("MESPRITBAD", "Cave Field")

You will get the third *Red Gem*.

Exit the Zeight and talk to Erin. Talk to Clear, then head east to Fort Rystrine to talk to Clear again.

### Marked for Death

Head up to the Grand Dream City Central Building's 99th floor. Follow M2 throughout.

!battle(["Luis",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Seanne",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

In the office room, a *Full Restore* is at the top. Attempt to exit in the bottom right.

!battle(["Jimmy",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Tarto",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

Take the ladder in the top left. A *Revival Herb* is in the corner.

!dbattle(["Sally",:GIRLSCOUTS,0], ["Mollie",:GIRLSCOUTS,0], "Concert Venue")

Hey, there's a *Focus Sash* at the top! Proceed to the room on the left. You'll find *3 Exp. Candy XL*.

!battle(["Emere",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Sedrik",:CUEBALL,0], "Concert Venue")

Exit at the bottom and finally go down to the first floor.

!battle(["Johnni",:OFFICER,0], "Concert Venue")

Just kidding. Head up to the rooftop.

!battle(["Carto",:DON,0], "Sky Field")

If Florin is alive, you'll get a double battle here:

!dbattle(["Florin",:LEADER_FLORIN,1], ["Talon",:LEADER_TALON_1,1])

If Florin is dead, then instead you'll have the following gauntlet:

!battle(["Talon",:LEADER_TALON_1,0])

!boss("RIFTTALON", "Sky Field")

### .Hit List: Spacea & Tiempa

Talk to M2 back at the Zeight. In Between Space and Time, you can talk to former Storm Chasers and read up on the backgrounds of the space hags. Head into the room at the top.

!boss("SPACEABAD", "Deep Earth Field")

!boss("TIEMPABAD", "Deep Earth Field")

Choose some options in the following... interactive scene? to end Spacea and Tiempa.

Back in the Zeight, wait until the 25th. Once you have control again, exit Zeight.

!dbattle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM3,3], ["Amber",:LEADER_AMBER2,3], "Desert Field")

When all is said and done, you can fly over to Teila Resort and talk to Tesla inside to see how she's doing, if you want...

That is a wrap on the .Karma Files content for the Renegade Route... :[
