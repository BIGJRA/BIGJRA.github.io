# .Karma Files (Renegade)

Return to the Obelisk and reenter Zeight. Back in Grand Dream City, enter the penthouse and talk to M2 on the top floor. Accept the request of M2 to join Venam in Grand Dream City.

Back in the Dream District, talk to M2 and Venam outside Mika's Cafe. Follow them to the Back Alley. Talk to them, and the uh..... PINK MAN. will get robbed. Chase his thief to the very bottom of Dream District South for a battle.

!battle(["Kageyama",:TOURIST,1], "City Field")

This is the same guy that was blocking the bridge in East Gearen all the way at the beginning of the game!

Once you finally regain control, head over to the Field of Pillars and enter Zeight.

### .Hit List: Karrina

You only get this section if Karrina is alive. You get to choose who sends a letter to Karrina, you, Karen, or M2. Tell M2 you are ready to go.

Below you will spawn a *Poke Toy*. Head up.

!battle(["Marena",:LASS,1], "Desert Field")

!battle(["Joe",:COOLTRAINER_M,1], "Desert Field")

Finally:

!battle(["Karrina",:GANGLEADER,3], "Desert Field")

She even stole Karen's Diancie. How rude! Karrina has good synergy with the desert field, but you too can make use of boosted Fire and Ground moves to emerge victorious.

In the game show, you get to vote: "GUILTY" "or" "NAH". You will receive the *Goocci Bag* and more importantly **Diancie**! Let's go!

### Chasing Uxie

Head on back to the Zeight. Accept M2's request to head to Aquamarine Cave and dive down.

!boss("UXIEBAD", "Cave Field")

You'll get a *Red Gem*!

Head back to the Obelisk and go to Zeight.

### .Hit List: Ren

Once you have control in the Dream Dream, go up. You'll fight M2 twice, in Singles and Doubles.

!battle(["M2",:TRAINER_M2,0], "City Field")

The gazebo Pokeball is a trap!

!battle(["Ren",:OUTCAST,8], "City Field")

You will get *Robo Ren's Cloak*... and more importantly, the **Genesect** contained inside!

Back in Sashila, enter the first room.

### Chasing Azelf & Mesprit

Fly over to Yui's Ranch and take a Braviary to Honec Woods. Exit Honec Woods to the west to reach the area with the Azelf Statue. Walk towards the shining star to reach the Den of Valor (not to be confused with Valor Mountain, of course).

**ZCell 142: Den of Valor**

!img("zcell142.png")

!boss("AZELFBAD", "Cave Field")

You will get another *Red Gem*. Back in Honec Woods, go right and talk to Clear.

Back in the Zeight, talk to the computer to get the next target. Fly to Gearen and head to Goldenwood Forest. Surf up at the very top to reach the Den of Verity, and fight Mesprit.

!boss("MESPRITBAD", "Cave Field")

You will get the third *Red Gem*.

Exit the Zeight and talk to Erin. Talk to Clear, then head east to Fort Rystrine to talk to Clear again.

### Marked for Death

Head up to the Grand Dream City Central Building's 99th floor. Follow M2 throughout.

!battle(["Luis",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Seanne",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

In the office room, a *Full Restore* is at the top. Attempt to exit in the bottom right.

!battle(["Jimmy",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Tarto",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

Take the ladder in the top left. A *Revival Herb* is in the corner.

!dbattle(["Sally",:GIRLSCOUTS,0], ["Mollie",:GIRLSCOUTS,0], "Concert Venue")

Hey, there's a *Focus Sash* at the top! Proceed to the room on the left. You'll find *3 Exp. Candy XL*.

!battle(["Emere",:CUEBALL,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Sedrik",:CUEBALL,0], "Concert Venue")

Exit at the bottom and finally go down to the first floor.

!battle(["Johnni",:OFFICER,0], "Concert Venue")

Just kidding. Head up to the rooftop.

!battle(["Carto",:DON,0], "Sky Field")

If Florin is alive, you'll get a double battle here:

!dbattle(["Florin",:LEADER_FLORIN,1], ["Talon",:LEADER_TALON_1,1], "Sky Field")

If Florin is dead, then instead you'll have the following gauntlet:

!battle(["Talon",:LEADER_TALON_1,0])

!boss("RIFTTALON", "Sky Field")

### .Hit List: Spacea & Tiempa

Talk to M2 back at the Zeight. In Between Space and Time, you can talk to former Storm Chasers and read up on the backgrounds of the space hags. Head into the room at the top.

!boss("SPACEABAD", "Deep Earth Field")

!boss("TIEMPABAD", "Deep Earth Field")

Tiempa's fight is extremely complicated. Once you "knock it out" by breaking all of its shields and its final HP bar, Tiempa timewarps to the previous snapshot, which here is just before she loses her second shield. From here you'll need to defeat both shields again, though you have to be careful: if enough turns go by, a timewarp will be executed to a previous battle state. This means you need to survive six health bars at a minimum while going fast!

Choose some options in the following... interactive scene? to end Spacea and Tiempa.

Back in the Zeight, wait until the 25th. Once you have control again, exit Zeight.

!dbattle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM3,3], ["Amber",:LEADER_AMBER2,3], "Desert Field")

When all is said and done, you can fly over to Teila Resort and talk to Tesla inside to see how she's doing, if you want...

That is a wrap on the .Karma Files content for the Renegade Route... :[
