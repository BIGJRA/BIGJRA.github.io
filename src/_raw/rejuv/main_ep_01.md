# Chapter 1: Crossroads of Destiny

One way or another, we're going to break the cycle. Together.

Welcome to my 100% walkthrough of Pokemon Rejuvenation!

My aim with this document is to provide a complete route through the game including every single item (including hidden items), available Pokemon, some tips for battle strategies, shop and tutor details, and more.

There are some parts that may spoil events that happen later in the game. I don't directly summarize story details, but you may want to consider playing the game once first without referencing this walkthrough if spoilers are a concern.

## Prologue

The game will start off asking if you want to skip the prologue. Rejuvenation is a very story-focused game, so I recommend viewing it if it is your first time playing. If you do skip the prologue, jump ahead to the next section.

As soon as you're done reading the Zorua and Pangoro story, take control of Maria and head downstairs to talk to Mom. Enter the bottom room on the left side of the first floor. Go downstairs and interact with the summoning table.

Head back upstairs and talk to Dad in the top-left room. Return to the kitchen to talk to Mom, then go upstairs. After a brief flash and the sound of breaking glass, go back downstairs and talk with the mysterious figure. Head back down to the basement to watch the cutscene.

After regaining control of Marianette, head down, east, and up through the hallway and watch the final cutscene of the prologue play out.

## S.S. Oceana

The game will ask which difficulty mode you'd prefer. I would recommend Story Mode for those that found Reborn too difficult. On the other hand, I would recommend Classic Mode to anyone looking for a challenge. Regardless of choice, the game allows you to change your difficulty setting later if you want. **I will be covering battles in this guide as they appear in Classic Mode**.

Register yourself as a trainer by choosing a gender and a "profile". You can even take a personality test to choose one!

Amanda will ask if you want to input a password. You can see password details [in the appendices](#full-password-list), though I recommend against using any for a first run.

Exit the first room and talk to Nancy. This is the first of instances that get you relationship points with characters, which affect how they view you, certain story events, and more. Any dialogue options which are not listed do not affect relationship points.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm fine. (Mom +2)
- ... (Mom -1)

Once you've talked to Nancy and can roam, explore the S.S. Oceana. In this game, talking to everyone and everything you see is vital to discovering new Pokemon and items, so it's a good idea to talk to everyone aboard.

Optionally, head down the stairs to the left. In each of the two leftmost rooms on this floor, you can interact with a notch on the wall to listen in on two conversations: one with unknown figures and the other including Nancy. Head up the stairs.

Head up two flights of stairs to talk to Captain Augustus. He'll explain a few of Rejuvenation's mechanics. Head downstairs and enter the double doors. Talk to Nancy to get the banquet started, when you're ready.

Once you regain control, follow the path and watch the events play out.

After either skipping the boat scenes or watching the cutscenes, talk to Tesla. Once you regain control, you can explore Oceana Pier.

If you want to talk to the woman on the northeast pier, you can get an all-expenses paid trip to Hoenn! Congratulations on finishing the game! Just kidding, of course. Our real journey has only just begun! 

Otherwise, there's not much to do here yet, so head into the gate on the north side.

## Gearen Laboratory

The trainers won't let you head west or east quite yet, so head into the building north.

After talking to Jan and Amanda, head into the room in the top left.

You'll then get to pick a starter Pokemon!. If you talk to the rainbow-colored machine on the right side, it will randomly choose for you among the 24 starters.

- The Grass types: **Bulbasaur**, **Chikorita**, **Treecko**, **Turtwig**, **Snivy**, **Chespin**, **Rowlet**, **Grookey**
- The Fire types: **Charmander**, **Cyndaquil**, **Torchic**, **Chimchar**, **Tepig**, **Fennekin**, **Litten**, **Scorbunny**
- The Water types: **Squirtle**, **Totodile**, **Mudkip**, **Piplup**, **Oshawott**, **Froakie**, **Popplio**, **Sobble**

You can quick save with 'D' in front of the Pokemon you choose and use F12 to soft reset for natures, IV's, shininess, and abilities. All Pokemon in this game have an equal chance to get hidden abilities, and the shiny rate is increased to a little over 1/100.

Once you've picked your starter, talk to Amanda for a battle! You can win or lose this battle.

!battle(["Amanda", :TRAINER_AMANDA, 0])

Note that in this game you can press "S" to check the stats of all the Pokemon, as well as all secondary effects in play. After the battle, she'll give you *5 Poke Balls*.

Head downstairs to talk to Jenner and you'll fight:

!battle(["Ren", :TRAINER_REN, 0])

After the fight with Ren, Jenner asks you to visit Route 1 to help Melia. He then gives you the *Pokedex* and the *Cybernav*! Head back downstairs.

The EV training center can be accessed by talking to the woman on the right of the counter, but none of its training rooms are open right now.

The guy running in place on the left will offer to give you cinematic bars during important cutscenes if you want. Talk to the girl behind the counter to buy some basic products.

!shop("Gearen Lab", ["Poke Ball", "Potion", "Repel", "Antidote"])

I recommend picking up at least a few Poke Balls as a full team is almost necessary to succeed in Rejuvenation.

There is a quest available here by talking to an NPC next to the nurse - I will cover it with the other "Help Center" quests later. When you're ready, head back outside. 

## Oceana Pier

A few things have opened up at the pier, so head south first.

You'll find a **Nidoran M** eating. Talk to it with a GourmetTreat for a battle.

The garden to the south is also now open, so you can catch level 5 **Fletchling** here by interacting with them. The bottom right tile in the garden here has a *Sweet Heart*, and there is an *X Accuracy* two tiles left and one up from there.

Head into the building on the west side that's now unlocked. Talk to the man with the yellow hair, then exit the building and watch Buizel run by. This starts a quest we'll complete later. Return to East Gearen.

## East Gearen City

It's worth noting that the Cybernav in this game has a feature called the Spice Scent which allows you to modify your encounter rate for free! This means you can crank it up high to get an encounter on every step, walk in grass hassle free by setting it to zero, or anything in between. It also means that Repels are effectively useless, so selling the ones we find is the way to go.

!enc(58)

Chingling can help in the fight against the gym dramatically, especially if you manage to evolve it. However, it is rare here and can be found much more reliably later.

To the right of the entrance to the lab, in a rock, you'll find a hidden *Ice Heal*. To the left of the Oceana Pier entrance below, you'll find a hidden *Poke Ball* in another rock. The empty space in the grass above contains a hidden *GourmetTreat*. We'll want some of these later to get event Pokemon.

Enter the "Velvet Building" here. On 1F you can get a *Great Ball*. Talk to the NPC in the center to choose between a *Mineral Ball* (left) and a *Steam Ball* (right). 

!battle(["Samson",:WORKERM,0])

On 2F, you can get a *Potion*. With a *GourmetTreat* in your bag at night, you can battle and catch **Pachirisu** here, as well. On 3F, you can get an *Exp. Candy XS*.

Head outside and enter the house to the left to get a *Repel*. Back outside, go left and up.

!battle(["Kaleb",:YOUNGSTER,0], "City Field")

To the right, you can get a hidden *Burn Heal* in a box. We can't do anything in the nearby "Violet Building". Don't cross the bridge above quite yet either - instead, return to the area south of the Lab.

Head to the right now. If you talk to the nerd on the east side of the bottom street, he'll give you *Reverse Candy*. In a rock below is a hidden *Potion*.

!battle(["Talia",:OPT,0], "City Field")

It's worth noting that battles in Gearen City take place on the City Field. Unlike Reborn, Rejuvenation doesn't have an in-game field note application, so you'll need to look at the field note text file in the game download folder or the wiki to get details on fields.

Nearby is a house containing the Name Rater, though this is redundant as we can change nicknames in the menu. One tile to the right of its door contains a hidden *Oran Berry*. Down and right from here is a rock containing a *Green Shard*.

!battle(["Derek",:CHARMER,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Lacey",:LASS,0], "City Field")

Up from Lacey is three tiles of grass - the middle one contains a hidden *Oran Berry*. Head up.

!battle(["Shakotal",:KIMONOGIRL,0], "City Field")

Up from here, you'll see an alleyway containing dumpsters. Just below the gates of this alleyway, you can get a hidden *Yellow Shard* halfway up the sidewalk on the right. Up in the alleyway you can find a hidden *Super Repel* at the end of the small path to the left, and a hidden *GourmetTreat* in the right side of the stack of three boxes. Talk to Nidoran F here, and it will run off. Head back down and left.

!battle(["Nadine",:LADY,0], "City Field")

You can get a hidden *Grass Gem* in a gap in the tall grass below Nadine, and a *Resist Wing* on the right side of the wall below.

Enter the "Emerald Building" here. Talk to the man in front of the elevator for a battle.

!battle(["Andrew",:WORKERM,0])

On 2F, you can talk to people to get a *Super Repel*, and *Full Heal*. A *Red Shard* is in the bottom left corner.

!battle(["Salem",:COOLTRAINER_M,0])

Head up to 3F at night. You'll be able to battle and catch **Shuppet**!

Head outside and go left. We'll come back to the Help Center in a bit, so continue left.

!battle(["Zara",:PICNICKER,0], "City Field")

Enter the Magnolia Library here. Upstairs, talk to Zumi on the right, and she'll start us on the *PictoZumi* Pokedex collection quest. We'll be back once we catch a Dedenne for her. Downstairs, pay the entrance fee of $300 if you want to talk to some NPCs beyond for lore.

After doing all this you may be strong enough to complete the final quest of this area for now. If you try to cross into the northwest side of the city, a thug will force you to pay $300 or to battle him.

!battle(["Kageyama",:TOURIST,0], "City Field")

When you win you can access the northwest area! (+1 Karma). This game has diverging story paths, and your level of Karma will affect which story paths you can complete. 

Go up and left from the bridge. You can get a hidden *Super Potion* in a rock here, and a hidden *Yellow Shard* above a dumpster. A gap in the grass below some trees right of the train station contains a hidden *Red Shard*. 

Talk to Nidoran F again and it will run off once more. There are a few more locations it will run to: the southeast side of the map, then a bench near the library. It will then run to the side of the Violet Building on the west, where you can battle and catch **Nidoran F**!

Head to further to the right from the lab than we did before. You'll see a screen flash to indicate we are now on the right-most side of East Gearen City, instead of the left-most side where we were before. Of course, there is a *West* Gearen City that we will visit far later in the game, so don't get it twisted.

Grab a hidden *Heart Scale* in a canister below a house. Enter the "Aqua Building" here. On 1F, you can get the *Old Rod* and an *Iron*.

!battle(["Henry",:WORKERM,0])

Be wary of going to 3F: you're not supposed to be able to win this one right now.

!battle(["Mercury",:CHALLENGER,0])

If you lose this battle, or any battle, you'll find yourself warped to the "Edge of My World" map. On this map, you can get 5 *Exp. Candy S* once a day. Standing on the warp returns you to the rest of the game.

Anyways, head back to East Gearen City (Right). Cross the bridge to the right of the Aqua Building.

!battle(["Denko",:HIKER,0], "City Field")

Inside the dumpster to the right is a hidden *Clever Wing*. Up from here, below a canister, you can get a hidden *Poke Ball*. Enter the Gearen Alleyway.

!enc(20)

Three tiles from the right side on top when you enter is a hidden *Red Shard*.

!battle(["Sim",:COOLGUY,0], "City Field")

Two more rocks inside contain a hidden *Blue Shard* and *Rare Candy*, respectively.

Return to East Gearen (Right). Past the factory above, you can go between fenceposts to get a *Super Potion* and hidden *Resist Wing* behind it. A rock on the right contains a hidden *Super Repel*. Down from here, a rock inside of a rectangle of grass contains a hidden *Potion*.

Speaking of grass, different Pokemon live on this side of the City:

!enc(59)

Catch a Female Jigglypuff to breed later.

There are a few shops here.

!shop("Poke Ball Boutique", ["Heavy Ball", "Moon Ball"])

!shop("Berry Emporium", ["Oran Berry", "Pecha Berry"])

You can pick up a few of each berry for the gym.

!battle(["Bianca",:BEAUTY,0], "City Field")

The PokeMart is below.

!shop("East Gearen Mart", ["Poke Ball", "Burn Heal", "Potion", "GourmetTreat", "Repel", "Reverse Candy"])

To the left, only during the daytime on weekdays there is a vendor:

!shop("East Gearen Sweets", ["Reverse Candy", "Soda Pop"])

The man here will attempt to sell you *Poke Balls* at $400 each. While this may seem like a rip-off, once you buy four, he'll give you a **Voltorb**!

Down from here, you'll see a *Reverse Candy* towards the bottom. The second tile from the left on the bottom of the nearby grass contains a hidden *TinyMushroom*, then a tile three up from the leftmost Murkrow contains a hidden *Repel*.

!battle(["Penelope",:BEAUTY,0], "City Field")

Down from here is Gearen Park - we'll return here in a little bit. For now, go right. Up and right from a biker are some purple tiles on the street. The second from the bottom contains a hidden *Blue Shard*.

!battle(["Rufus",:CUEBALL,0], "City Field")

Up and right, you can find a hidden *Antidote* in the middle dumpster. A hidden *Exp. Candy S* is in the middle box above. Up from here, in the top tile of the left fence before the hedges, you can find a hidden *Paralyze Heal*.

Along the east side of the city, you should see Buizel. His trainer will show up.

!battle(["Buzzington",:CHARMER,0], "City Field")

Win the battle, and **Buizel** is yours!

Head up to the Chrisola Hotel courtyard. On the left is an *Iron*. The tile to the right of the first patch of grass right of the entrance contains a hidden *Green Shard*. Inside the hedge maze to the right, you can get hidden *Repel* and *Red Shard* in rocks, hidden *Revive* in the bottom right corner, as well as an *Antidote* and *TM83 Infestation*.

## Chrisola Resort

Enter the Chrisola Hotel Resort at the top of the map.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Enter the Chrisola Hotel early-game (Saki +1).

After you regain control, talk to a man in the bottom right for a *Super Potion*. Enter the right hallway. In one room you can get *TM126 Whirlpool*. In the hallway on the left, head into the open room at the top and interact with the tile down and right from the top left plant for $1500!

Head to the Casino level and talk to the red-haired fellow. They'll flush their Coin Case down the drain, so we can pick it up later.

You've probably noticed a few popups regarding achievements thus far. Complete them and you'll earn AP, redeemable here. For now, we probably can't get much but I recommend saving up for the HM Items as they'll make your life a lot easier. The card items will allow you access to EV Training rooms in Jenner's lab, so those are nice too. The Exp. All isn't that necessary anymore in this game since there are lots of grinding options available. Anyways, talk to the girl on the right side to get an *Achievement Card*.

!shop("AP Shop", [["Adamant Mint", "3 AP"], ["Jolly Mint", "3 AP"], ["Brave Mint", "3 AP"], ["Timid Mint", "3 AP"], ["Modest Mint", "3 AP"], ["Quiet Mint", "3 AP"], ["Calm Mint", "3 AP"], ["Bold Mint", "3 AP"], ["PP Up", "6 AP"], ["Golden Axe", "10 AP"], ["Golden Hammer", "10 AP"], ["Golden Surfboard", "15 AP"], ["Golden Gauntlet", "15 AP"], ["Golden Scuba Gear", "15 AP"], ["Golden Wings", "20 AP"], ["Golden Jetpack", "20 AP"], ["Golden Drift Board", "20 AP"], ["Golden Claws", "20 AP"], ["Exp. All", "30 AP"], ["HP Card", "10 AP"], ["Atk Card", "10 AP"], ["Def Card", "10 AP"], ["Speed Card", "10 AP"], ["Sp. Atk Card", "10 AP"], ["Sp. Def Card", "10 AP"]])

My thoughts:

- I wouldn't recommend buying any of the consumable items until you get everything else, as you can simply breed or catch multiple of the same Pokemon to get better natures and abilities.
- Golden Items allow us to use HMs and field moves without needing a Pokemon in the party that has learned them. These are extremely helpful and I recommend buying them as you get the corresponding field moves.
- The cards let you into the basement of the Gearen lab to do rapid EV training. When you do get access to each EV room, inside you'll find the respective Power item: *Power Anklet*, *Power Band*, *Power Belt*, *Power Bracer*, *Power Lens*, *Power Weight*. This isn't strictly necessary yet, but it is worth doing once we have around 4 badges to help make EV Training a breeze.
- Exp. All is very helpful for grinding, but with the grinders and Exp. Candies, it may not be the most useful thing for its high price yet. 

When I play, I tend to buy the Golden Hammer first, then begin collecting the EV Cards. I'll buy the Golden Axe right before I get Cut, then finish with AP cards. Then I'll buy the rest of the Golden Items as I need them, and the Exp. All when I have enough AP.

On the left side, we can't do much without the coin case. There is a Lotto Attendant here however:

!shop("Lotto Attendant", [["Master Ball", "5 Matches"], ["Max Revive", "4 Matches"], ["Exp. Share", "3 Matches"], ["PP Up", "2 Matches"], ["Ultra Ball", "1 Matches"]])

Head up to the top floor of the building, Rooftop. There is an Audino breeder up here: every time you beat them, you will get 3 *Exp. Candy S*.

!battle(["Lemmi",:POKEBREEDER_F,0])

Combined with the hard level cap, these breeders make level management in this game a breeze!

On the left side, south of the Lilligant fountain, a perpendicular angle is formed by black diamond patterns in the tiles. On the first white tile to the right and above these angles is a hidden *Oran Berry*. Four tiles down and two right from the center of the map (for now, a person is standing there) is a hidden *Resist Wing*. Finally, two tiles down and two tiles right from the center of the helipad stairs has a hidden *Reverse Candy*.

There are Pokemon to encounter here.

!enc(228)

Once you're done, head back outside.

## Gearen Park

Head to the bottom left side of East Gearen (Right) and enter Gearen Park.

!enc(24)

In the top left corner of the park, you'll see a strange crack in the ground. At night, you can interact with this crack to catch **Unown**!

On the right in a blue flower is a hidden *Blue Shard*. A purple flower on the left side of the map contains a hidden *Honey*. Exactly nine tiles to the right, on the other side of a rock face, is another hidden *Honey*. A flower patch between tall grass down and left from here contains a hidden *Carbos*. To the right is a hidden *Yellow Shard* in the middle of the "cross" of dirt on the right side. Finally, two tiles down and three tiles right from the entrance to the tent is a hidden *Muscle Wing* and one tile to the right of the ledge on top is a hidden *Rare Candy*.

Enter Luck's Tent. On the left, you can talk to Marshadow, who will teach us Tutor Moves in exchange for Shards. Note that you can learn any move you've purchased via the Cybernav.

!tutor("Marshie Move Tutor", [["Bind", "2 Red Shards"], ["Covet", "2 Blue Shards"], ["Block", "2 Yellow Shards"], ["Spite", "2 Green Shards"], ["Swift", "2 Yellow Shards"], ["After You", "2 Red Shards"], ["Gravity", "2 Green Shards"], ["Magic Coat", "2 Blue Shards"], ["Venom Drench", "2 Blue Shards"]])

Talk to Mr. Luck to begin the *Bad Luck* quest. Sign his contract to have your sprite changed! Ask him to be changed back, then follow him to the back room. He'll request that we find for him one Black Prism, which we can find on rainbow-aura wild Pokemon that are about a 1% chance of appearing. Head into the grass and grind one of these out... and return with the Prism to be turned back, completing this quest.

On your way out, Luck will tell you that he wants more Black Prisms.

!shop("Doxie Black Prism Exchange", [["10 Green Shards", "3 Black Prisms"], ["10 Red Shards", "3 Black Prisms"], ["10 Blue Shards", "3 Black Prisms"], ["10 Yellow Shards", "3 Black Prisms"], ["4 Nuggets", "5 Black Prisms"], ["3 Pearl Strings", "8 Black Prisms"], ["2 Cell Imprints", "10 Black Prisms"], ["3 Glitter Balls", "15 Black Prisms"]])

!shop("Mr. Luck Contracts", [["Technique Contract", "3 Black Prisms"], ["Wealth Contract", "3 Black Prisms"], ["Shiny Contract", "3 Black Prisms"], ["Legacy Contract", "0 Black Prisms"], ["Aevis Contract", "5 Black Prisms"], ["Aevia Contract", "5 Black Prisms"], ["Axel Contract", "5 Black Prisms"], ["Ariana Contract", "5 Black Prisms"], ["Alain Contract", "5 Black Prisms"], ["Aero Contract", "5 Black Prisms"], ["ANA Contract", "5 Black Prisms"], ["Difficulty Contract", "0 Black Prisms"], ["???", "999 Black Prisms"]])

If you collect Black Prisms, come back here to exchange them. Note that the Difficulty Contract lets you switch between the two difficulties for free, if you need to.

## Abandoned Sewers

To progress the story, head north into Venam's front yard. Head to the Emporium to get a *Pecha Berry?* from the attendant, then give it to Venam.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- All me. (Venam +2)
- Maybe... (Venam +1)
- No, actually. (Neutral)

Head to the southeast of town and follow Venam into the sewers. You'll be teaming up with Ren here, who will heal your Pokemon after every battle. Additionally, if you try to catch Pokemon while with Ren, you'll need to knock one of the two out in order to catch the other, which can be frustrating.

!partner(["Ren",:TRAINER_REN,3])

Anyways, there are lots of new Pokemon here:

!enc(55, nil, ["Old"])

!battle(["Luca",:LASS,0])

Head left, and on the second tile from left at the bottom is a hidden *Poison Gem*. Head across the bridge and right to get a *Great Ball*.

!battle(["Jerald",:TECH,0])

Go up. Before crossing the bridge, there is a hidden *Zinc* in the bottom right corner. Talk to a bug catcher to get a *Pecha Berry*. To the right is a *Bold Mint*. Above the girl to the left is a hidden *Potion* and in the thing to the right is another *Potion*.

Head back down and cross the bridge to the left. 

!battle(["Amanda",:PICNICKER,0])

Attempt to enter the room Venam runs into on the left and it will lock you out. There's an *Antidote* here.

Back at Amanda, go down. 

!battle(["Bob",:CUEBALL,0])

The bottom left corner has a hidden *Reverse Candy*. If the guy flushed it at the Hotel, go down and all the way left to grab the *Coin Case*! 

Head back across the bridge and enter the open generator room above. Start the third, first, then second generator to finish this scintillating puzzle. Head left and into the room Venam is in for a long cutscene and a battle.

!boss("BOSSGARBODOR")

This is our first encounter with a Ruthless Pokemon, which are bosses similar to Totems from Gen. VII. In this game, there are tons of possible effects that they can cause, and you have to defeat multiple shields to knock them out.

This battle is a good introduction to them that shouldn't be too hard: the boss is just a "regular" Lv. 12 Garbodor. It gains the Dark type and eventually a Trubbish ally, but otherwise this fight boils down to simply defeating a Garbodor three times with the help of your ally Ren.

## Game Corner & Gearen Park Conversation

Now that we have the Coin Case, let's go gambling! While you can get all the rewards right now with enough patience, it's not necessary to grab everything right now. Rejuvenation doesn't currently have the high-stakes Roulette table that Reborn does, so being really, really good at Voltorb Flip is your best bet.

Anyways, there's a grand total of 120 coins along the ground in there, try to find them all. Otherwise, here's what you can get here:

!shop("Game Corner Coins", [["50 Coins", "$1000"], ["500 Coins", "$10000"]])

!shop("Game Corner Left", [["TM70 Flash", "1000 Coins"], ["TM10 Hidden Power", "5000 Coins"]])

!shop("Game Corner Right", [["Seel", "1000 Coins", true], ["Spoink", "4000 Coins", true], ["Maractus", "5000 Coins", true], ["Helioptile", "6500 Coins", true]])

Anyways, once you've gambled to your heart's content, there is a bit more optional stuff to do if you want.

In Gearen Park, talk to Melia for an optional scene.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Melia in the park (Melia +3)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You like photography? (Melia +1)
- What are you doing? (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I love photography! (Melia +2)
- I appreciate the art! (Melia +1)
- It's not for me. (Neutral)
- Photography's boring. (Melia -2)

Additionally, head back to Magnolia Library and pay the $300 to enter. For a short time you'll be able to battle Ren! It's optional experience and money should you want it.

!battle(["Ren",:TRAINER_REN,15])

## East Gearen Help Center Quests 

Head over to the Help Center near the library. We can accept quests on the upper bulletin board - completing them will grant us various rewards. Note that you can also accept some of them in the overworld by talking to the quest-givers.

### Save Starly!

Start at Gearen Lab. Talk to the black-haired girl next to Nurse Joy. Go to the southwest dock on the Oceana Pier. 

!battle(["Den",:CUEBALL,0], "City Field")

Defeat the trainer here, and witness a beautiful scene. Talk to the girl in the lab again.

Claim your reward at the help center: $890, and *2 Potions*! (+1 Karma)

### Missing Mother!

Start at Petal Salon. Talk to Sasha upstairs.

Next, go to Aqua Building 2F and talk to the girl. Return to Sasha and talk to her.

Go to Velvet Building 3F and talk to the southeast girl. Return to Sasha and talk to her again.

Go to Emerald Building Lobby and talk to the red-haired person. Return to Sasha... again, and follow her into a building in Oceana Pier.

!battle(["Stella",:BEAUTY,0])

Claim your reward at the help center: $550. (+1 Karma)

We can also go back to the Petal Salon for one free haircut, which boosts friendship. Helpful for friendship evolving Pokemon like Chingling. It will cost $1500 after the first and it can be done only once a day.

### The Hidden Library

Start at Gearen Lab. Go to the second floor via the stairs on the left, then talk to the backpacker in the right room. 

There are three people we need to find. Talk to the mother in the north side of East Gearen (Left). Next, talk to the receptionist at the Chrisola Hotel, then talk to Karrina in south-east Gearen. Return to the backpacker and answer his questions.

Claim your reward at the help center: 5 *Great Balls* and *3 Timer Balls*. (+1 Karma)

### Love Letter

Start at the Oceana Pier Gate. Talk to the man upstairs and get the *Love Letter*.

Buy 1 Burn Heal from the Poke Mart if you don't have one, then bring both items to Cameron to the east of the Mart. Return to Eric in the Oceana Pier Gate.

Claim your reward at the help center: $350 and *Nugget*! (+1 Karma)

### Dangerous Pokemon

Start at Oceana Pier, and head right. Make sure you have a good water or rock type or two. 

!boss("BOSSPYROAR", "City Field")

A tough fight. One recommendation is to use the Field to your advantage: moves like Smog and Poison Gas, found on sewer Pokemon like Koffing, will badly poison. Physical Normal moves and Poison type moves get their damage boosted, so may be the best way to deal damage in lieu of super effective moves. 

If you win, accept **Litleo** in your team!

Claim your reward at the help center: $350 and *Super Potion*! (+1 Karma)

### Battle Me!

Start at Chrisola Hotel. Make sure you have a good team near or at the level cap and go to rooftop.

!battle(["Novae",:WANDERER,0], "City Field")

This is a tough battle to be sure, and this won't be the last time you'll face her. If you can't really win with your team right now don't worry, you can come back later to finish this one.

Anyways, all that's left is to claim your reward at the help center --
$350 and **Pichu**! (+1 Karma)

### Wretched Music

Talk to the receptionist at the Chrisola Hotel and agree to go to the basement.

!battle(["Rorim B.",:DISCOTEEN,0])

Vivillon hits somewhat hard, and Lombre will well positioned to take advantage of rain.This battle isn't super hard with a good flying type or two, or probably most well-rounded sixes.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You should stop. (RorimB -1)
- Yeah, he's a jerk. (RorimB +2)
- The other guests...? (RorimB +1)

Talk to the receptionist to go back upstairs. Talk to the bell boy in the left hallway, and the girl in the top-left room in the right hallway. Talk to the receptionist to return to the basement once more.

Return to the help center to get your reward: $1100, a *GourmetTreat*, and *TM119 Magical Leaf*! (+1 Karma)

## PoisonHeart Badge

It's time to take on Venam's gym in East Gearen.

!shop("East Gearen Gym", ["Potion", "Antidote", "Repel", "Poke Ball"])

Talk to the trainers around the gym.

!battle(["Reina",:COOLTRAINER_F,0], "Concert Venue")

The tiles in the gym have various effects. Step on the white tile on the raised center of the gym to reach the bottom left corner, where a hidden *Psychic Gem* awaits in a trash can!

Stepping on the Poke Ball will cause us to have to fight a wild Pokemon: Trubbish, Grimer, Koffing, or notably **Skrelp**.

Enter the room on the left and head up either path.

!battle(["Luca",:LASS,1], "Concert Venue")

Make your way up from here, again on any path, and talk to the boy as well as the monitor. Warp on back.

Enter the right hallway, and walk up through the tiles.

!battle(["Lenny",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "Concert Venue")

Talk to the computer then warp back. We now have the numbers to access the gym's secret: simply step on the tiles in the center room in the order 2332-4332. Enter the backroom, then step on the warp on the right to access the secret Gearen Alleyway area.

You can find a hidden *Psychic Gem* beneath the second tile of fence, and a hidden *Fresh Water* in a box below. You can also get a **Seviper** egg to the right!

Back in the backstage area, step on the left warp then head left to stand on the center stage tile. You'll now be able to fight Venam!

!battle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,0], "Concert Venue")

!move("VENAMSKISS")

This is a somewhat tough battle, though you can level a team of six all the way up to the Lv. 18 cap to gain a bit of an advantage. Read the field notes for the Concert Venue to see how Venam uses this field effect to her advantage - moves like Acid, Fake Out, and Rollout will all be boosted on it. That said, you can generally power through this one with raw stats and with super effective Ground and Psychic type moves.

After the battle, you'll be rewarded with the *PoisonHeart Badge*! She'll also give you *TM102 Poison Sweep*! This is a new move that can be useful in the early game. Oh, and the level cap has now gone up: to Lv. 25!

## Post-Gym Quests

On your way out of the gym, talk to Ayuda to get the *Gather Cube*! 

Some quests have opened, everything in this section is optional though.

Head into Venam's house south of the hotel. If you head upstairs, you'll find a *Poison Barb*.

Back in Gearen Park, now you'll be able to give a GourmetTreat to **Gossifleur** for a battle!

Head back to Gearen Lab and talk to the girl sitting by the computer on the left. Now that we have a badge, she'll ask for some help with an online fangame league. She'll then give you a *Badge Card*. Talk to her again and agree to help.

You'll need to name your trainer and pick a starter to use throughout this quest. The rest of the team will be built up around your starter choice. For now, these are the teams you'll get to use, depending on your starter:

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,0], "Virtual Trainer (Chikorita)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,10], "Virtual Trainer (Cyndaquil)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,20], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

!battle(["Falkner",:JOHTO_1,0], "Glitch Field")

If you win, you'll get a *Virtual Badge*. That's all she needs for now, we'll come back after we have two badges.

The Poke Ball Boutique has updated inventory now that we have a badge. 

!shop("Poke Ball Boutique (1 Badge)", ["Heavy Ball", "Moon Ball", "Love Ball", "Fast Ball"])

Love Balls are a very useful ball for their price, just pay attention to the gender of what you're trying to catch.

Head into the help center and talk to Ayuda. He will task us with collecting five Zygarde cells! These are scattered all around the world... but I have gone through the painstaking effort to find them all for you!

**ZCell 001: East Gearen City (Left)**

**ZCell 002: Oceana Pier**

!img("zcell002.png")

**ZCell 003: Chrisola Rooftop (Daytime Only)**

!img("zcell003.png")

**ZCell 004: Gearen Alleyway (through Venam's secret warp)**

!img("zcell004.png")

## Route 1 and Goldenwood Forest

Once you're ready to leave, head to the northwest part of town and enter the train station. Inside the station, you'll meet up with Tesla, who'll buy you a ticket and give you *3 Potions*. Talk to the grandfather in the station and agree to help him for the *Lost Girl!* quest, then board the train.

Talk to Melia below, then to the old woman to begin the *My Darling Furfrou...* quest.

!enc(5, ["Grass"])

Grab a *Super Repel* here, then a hidden *Potion* in a flower beneath Whismur. Talk to said **Whismur** with a GourmetTreat for a battle!

Grab *TM60 Quash* to the north, then proceed to Goldenwood Forest. Melia will join your party!

!partner(["Melia",:TRAINER_MELIA1,0])

!enc(25, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

Talk to the fisherman here to start *The Big Catch!* quest.

Up from here, go right. You'll see the titular Pokemon from the *My Darling Furfrou...* quest here - talk to it and it will return to Barbara.

Next, take the stairs to the left.

!battle(["Orlando",:FISHERMAN,0], "Forest Field")

Go left from here, then go down the stairs. Shimmy behind a tree and go to the bottom left corner of the area to talk to the *Lost Girl!* in question. Two tiles right and one down from the bottom right corner of this rock is a hidden *Rare Candy*.

You can talk to and battle the overworld **Yanma** and Sentret in this area. Up some stairs in the top left side of the area, you can get a hidden *Potion* in a rock.

On the left side of the map, you'll find *Black Apricorn* on the left. Talk to it three times to get three. Return to the fisherman, defeat *The Big Catch!* itself... a Machine Lairon? You'll then obtain *5 Exp. Candy S* and *5 Great Balls* (+1 Karma).

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You ok? (Melia +2)
- That was close... (Neutral)

Next, exit the Forest back to Route 1. Talk to the lady to finish "My Darling Furfrou..." and obtain *5 Potions* and *Great Ball* (+1 Karma).

With that out of the way, enter the cave at the top of the area.

There are some trainers south to battle. When you're ready, head north into Goldenwood Cave.

!enc(8, ["Grass", "Cave", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

Cross the bridge. In a dark spot is a hidden *TinyMushroom*. Cross the next bridge to get a hidden *Potion* at the base of the tree.

Cross to the right for a battle.

!battle(["Mars",:CHALLENGER,0], "Cave Field")

Our first battle against the some Aevian regional form Pokemon! Flying moves are your best bet for super effective damage in this one, though it shouldn't be too tough with some physical bulk. For winning, you'll get a *Star Shard* and an **Aevian Sewaddle**!

Cross the bridge up to the left. You'll have to fight a Prism Nidorino.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Did you get my good side? (Melia +2)
- Don't take pictures of me... (Melia -2)

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* in the bottom left corner of this area, a hidden *Great Ball* on some sprouts above, and a hidden *TinyMushroom* in a rock on the right.

Follow the path through to the Silent Grove. Heal your team and talk to Melia.

!battle(["Melia",:TRAINER_MELIA1,0], "Forest Field")

Your second-stage starter and allies should be able to make short work of this team. Just be careful to not let Togepi buff itself up with Ancientpower too many times and you can make it through.

## Goldenwood Xen Attack

As soon as Melia leaves, head back out through Goldenwood Cave. In the briefcase, enter 3845 for an *Ability Capsule*. To progress, enter 6489. You'll get the *Snag Machine* and *15 Poke Balls*. Just like in Colosseum and XD, all you must do is use Poke Balls on opponents' Shadow Pokemon to catch them. We won't be able to purify Shadow Pokemon quite yet, nor can we use them in Gym Battles until they are purified.

!battle(["Nickoli",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Forest Field")

Go ahead and catch the **Shadow Meowth**. Talk to the grunt on the left next, catching her **Shadow Finneon**.

!battle(["Leela",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Forest Field")

Proceed south.

!battle(["Shiela",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Daryle",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Forest Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We have to. (Melia +2)
- I'm not so sure myself... (Neutral)
- With that attitude? Nope. (Melia -2)

!battle(["Henrie",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Forest Field")

Snag his **Shadow Cacnea**. Grab a hidden *Rare Candy* in the pumpkin. Head left.

!battle(["Eli and Sharon",:MISFORTUNATEDUO,0])

A weak early game team, but you'll have to get used to the doubles format present in much of Rejuvenation. Murkrow is the hardest hitter, while you'll have to be careful about the status spreading from Glameow and Stunky.

!battle(["Zetta",:XENEXECUTIVE_1,1], "Forest Field")

Start by capturing **Shadow Snorunt**. Quilava and Meowth should not be too threatening at this phase as you should have type coverage but watch out for Minior getting off a Rollout or self-destructing. Type: Null is bulky at this point in the game, but if you can status it, you'll be able to whittle it down.

After witnessing a scene and going north, grab the *Code Evo Rift Notes*.

!boss("RIFTGYARADOS1", "Dimensional Field")

This is the first of the Rift boss fights in Rejuvenation. Using moves like Growl, Charm, or Noble Roar can really help here, though be wary that it resets stat losses when its first shield breaks. Putting it to sleep is great too, with the added benefit on this field of draining health while asleep every turn. Making it too weak to knock out your Pokemon and railing it with super effective moves, particularly field-boosted Dark moves, is the key to victory. Winning awards +1 Karma, however, the plot will progress even if you lose.

Talk to the grandfather in the train station to finish *Lost Girl!*. He'll give you *4 Exp. Candy S*.

Return to Jenner's Lab and head upstairs. You'll need to battle Madelis' Houndoom as Melia, using Togepi. 

!newself(["Melia",:TRAINER_MELIA1,1], "Melia")

!battle(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,3])

Winning is not required: it requires a good deal of luck to win... or time resetting. The strategy that worked for me was: Ancientpower (reset until boost), Yawn, switch in Buneary, Fake Out, Double Hit, Double Hit (requires 2+ sleep turns). 

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Madelis with Melia (+1 Melia)

That's it for Chapter 1!
