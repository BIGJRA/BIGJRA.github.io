# Chapter 7: A Teila Fire and Ice

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Good morning? (Neutral)
- Does it look like I'm okay? (-1 Aelita)

Make your way down to Terajuma Beach. To the right, you can buy a *Casteliacone* for $100 (or 12 for $1000).

Talk to Holly on the beach, then head to the stage area on the left side. Talk to the familiar musician on the right here, then to Holly again to end the festival.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Encore! (+2 Aelita)
- Uh... (Neutral)

Time for a 2v2 battle. You get to pick four of your Pokemon.

!partner(["Melia",:ENIGMA,1])

!dbattle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,2], ["Saki",:LEADER_SAKI,0], "Glitch Field")

A little Protect or Wide Guard will go a long way if you're stuck here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I had fun! (+2 Melia)
- It was a hassle... (-2 Melia)

Return to Kakori and talk to Crawli by the squad house. Head upstairs and sleep. Back downstairs, watch Saki's livestream. Shoutout "TerraFan". 

It is worth noting that now that we've beaten Crawli, all the boat rides from Kakori to Oceana Pier and vice versa are free now. Very cool.

## Aquamarine Cave

Head into the Mynori Sea and go west onto Route 5. You'll see Dragonite here once again - it's lost its letters. One is straight to the left of it, one is straight above it, one is on a northeast island, and one is next to the entrance to Aquamarine Cave. Return them to get a *Shiny Stone*!

Grab the hidden *Shoal Shell* and enter the Aquamarine Cave.

!enc(302, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Grab the hidden *Max Repel*, *Elemental Seed*, and *Water Gem*. A guy to the right will give you *TM05 Roar*. Down the ladder, pick up the hidden *Escape Rope* and *Blue Shard*.

!battle(["Fiona",:COOLTRAINER_F,0], "Crystal Cavern")

Continuing on, snag the hidden *Rock Gem* and *Synthetic Seed*.

!battle(["Sami",:FISHERMAN,0], "Crystal Cavern")

Go surfing north and pick up the hidden *Exp. Candy M*. On the left, behind a mining rock is a *Lax Mint* and hidden *Big Pearl*. I will recommend saving the Blast Powder to get these items for later, however. Behind another rock is a hidden *Exp. Candy L*, though again not worth using the limited Blast Powder on. Head down the ladder at the bottom.

Hidden in this room is *Shoal Salt*, *Shoal Shell*, and *Blue Shard*. Surf on the water and go up through the middle waterfall. Continue into the next room.

You can find a hidden *Super Repel*, *Super Potion*, *GourmetTreat*, and *Green Shard*. Our objective is pushing the floating stones onto the lit up tiles. Push the five stones into place... as well as Braixen into place, to get the door to open.

Hidden are *2 Water Gems*, *Red Shard*, and *Blue Shard*.

!battle(["???",:XENMAGE_M,0], "Water Surface")

Push the stones back onto their spots and step on the tile to break the door once more.

**ZCell 056: Aquamarine Chamber**

!img("zcell056.png")

Back outside, go up the ladder to the left. Grab the hidden *Ice Heal* and hop down. Grab the hidden *Star Piece* and exit to the other side of Route 5. Obtain the hidden *Yellow Shard*, *Ether*, *Love Ball*, *Lemonade*, *Pearl*, and *Repel*. Continue left!

## Teila Resort

To the left, pick the *Occa Berry*, as well as:

**ZCell 057: Teila Resort**

!img("zcell057.png")

Go left and up, to the large building. Go right to get a hidden *Full Heal* and a *Lax Mint*, then enter the large building. After the conversation, talk to the person at the front desk to get a souvenir for the *A Souvenir For Mom* quest. Go up to the PC and grab Shelmet and Oranguru. Back on the east side of Teila Resort, talk to the old man near the above cell, show him Shelmet, and obtain a *Shell Bell*!

Go left then down at your first opportunity to grab a *Hyper Potion* as well as:

**ZCell 058: Teila Resort**

!img("zcell058.png")

Inside this house, show a Psychic type (the Oranguru) to a person at the top right to get *Wise Glasses*. The man below wants to trade Oranguru for **Passimian**!

Outside, go left. Grab the *Elixir* and hidden *Rawst Berry*, *Water Gem*, and *Blue Shard*. At the bottom, there are some shops:

!shop("Teila Resort (Top)", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Super Potion", "Full Heal", "Antidote", "Ice Heal", "Paralyze Heal", "Burn Heal", "GourmetTreat", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Reverse Candy"])

!shop("Teila Resort (Middle)", ["Apophyll Pancakes", "Tart Apple", "Sweet Apple"])

The bottom vendor sells *Berry Juice* for $1000.

Above, to the left, you'll see a Noctowl Statue to activate for fast travel. Reenter the building at the top of Teila Resort. Show your fighting type (Passimian?) to a guy inside to get a *Muscle Band*. Head upstairs and enter the room on the right:

**ZCell 059: Teila Resort**

!img("zcell059.png")

Downstairs on the left side, you can buy Pokemon massage packages. The cheapest is $1500, the next is $3500, and the last is $6500, which comes with *3 Fresh Waters* and *3 Revives*! Each sequentially increases your Pokemon's happiness.

Enter Tesla's office on the right. She will give us *TM101 Rock Climb*! Head back outside.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're foolish. (+2 Melia, -1 Venam)
- Contacts Smonctracts. (-1 Melia, +2 Venam)
- You're stupid. (-2 Melia, -2 Venam)

## Aquamarine Cave 2

Next, we must go find Amber. Re-enter Aquamarine Cave, Rock Climb to the right, then follow the path down to the basement as we did before. Take the second ladder down to the depths. All the way on the right, you can Rock Climb to *TM20 Safeguard*!

Climb back up the ladder and Rock Climb to the left. Pick up the *Water Stone* as well as the hidden *2 Pearls* and *2 Blue Shards*. Use Rock Smash to reach the top of this area. Pick up the hidden *Repel*, *Green Shard*, and *Exp. Candy M*. In the treasure chest is *3 Exp. Candy XL*, and *Macho Brace*. To the right, get the hidden *Telluric Seed* and the shining *Aquamarine Ore*! Backtrack to the bottom left and go down the ladder.

Grab the hidden *Fresh Water* and *Ether*, then go to the top right. After the conversation, decline the fast travel request, because there is a ladder to a new area in the bottom right side of this map: take it. Get the hidden *Green Shard* and go right.

!battle(["Heather",:LADY,0], "Crystal Cavern")

!battle(["Ronnie",:BLACKBELT,0], "Crystal Cavern")
 
Go down and right, grab the hidden *Rock Gem*, then go right.

!battle(["Becky",:COOLTRAINER_F,0], "Crystal Cavern")

Pick up the hidden *Blue Shard* and go up.

!battle(["Lex",:ROCKER,0], "Crystal Cavern")

The *Sea Incense* is at the top. Hop down the ledges to the bottom right corner of the room. If you got one from the Kecleon Bazaar earlier, give a Protein to the man in exchange for **Tyrogue**! Pick up the *Link Heart* to the left... then climb the nearby ladder by going all the way back around the ledges.

Nab the hidden *Escape Rope* and *Synthetic Seed*, then go up. This next area has a hidden *Elixir* and *Elemental Seed*. 

!enc(325, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Talk to the man in here, then surf to the left side of the room and use Rock Climb. Mine some rocks. Note that there is a hidden *Link Heart* behind a rock, but we are out of Blast Powder. Back on the water, you can find Poliwag #5 for the *Poliwag Quest*! Climb the rocks on the right side of the map to get a hidden *Hyper Potion* as well as a *Mild Mint* and *4 Exp. Candy L*. Exit the Secluded Shore at the top to reach a new section of Route 5. Straight up:

**ZCell 060: Route 5**

!img("zcell060.png")

Go down and right. You'll find a hidden *Pearl* and *Zinc* as well as a *Sun Stone* and *TM104 Deluge*. To the left you'll find a hidden *Resist Wing* in the water. 

Go south, back through Aquamarine Cave, and return to Teila Resort and go to Tesla's Office.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- What did you do? (Neutral)
- It's not your fault. (+2 Tesla)
- Maybe it was. (-4 Melia if current Melia points < 0, else -2)

Head back outside and enter the house to the left, previously blocked by Saki:

**ZCell 061: Teila Resort**

!img("zcell061.png")

Talk to Melia inside the previous house and agree to sleep. Wake up, talk to the crew outside, then to Tesla in her office.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sorry. (-2 Amber)
- ... (+1 Amber)
- It's weird ass hell out here. (+2 Amber)

Go right in Aquamarine Cave for a conversation. Here you will decide if you **Trust Jenner** or not. This causes some relationship points and other details of the story to change. Choosing not to trust Jenner also contributes: (+10 [renegade points](#paragon-and-renegade-routes)).

!battle(["Jenner",:PROFJENNER,0], "Crystal Cavern")

For winning, you will get **Slowpoke (Galarian)**! You can choose between a *Galarica Cuff* and a *Galarica Wreath*.

Once you're back in Teila, sleep again by talking to Melia. Head outside to learn of our trial in Magrodar Crater!

## Magrodar Crater

!enc(213)

Catch a Spinda while we're here to trade away, later. The black stones in this area float and can be pushed, but only during the nighttime. To the left, push a floating stone out of the way to get a *Sun Stone* and:

**ZCell 062: Magrodar Crater**

!img("zcell062.png")

On the right, push away another floating stone to reach a hidden *Black Prism*.

!battle(["Valencia",:LADY,0], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Brady",:CHARMER,0], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Alex",:POKEMONRANGER_F1,1], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Hen",:HIKER,0], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Sam",:POKEMONRANGER_M1,1], "Rocky Field")

On the right, grab a *Charcoal* as well as:

**ZCell 063: Magrodar Crater**

!img("zcell063.png")

!boss("TAPUKOKOMAGRODAR", "Dragon's Den")

This is a tough fight, in no small part thanks to the SOS Charizard hitting really hard on this field. Tapu Koko likes to use screens, so being able to break those or score critical hits is key. Especially when against Mega Charizard X, Ground moves like Bulldoze and Earthquake are good ideas for heavy spread damage. You'll get the Earth Relic after!

Enter Tesla's Villa next to the Noctowl Statue. Head upstairs, exiting at the bottom left to grab a *Protein*. Now you can return to Aquamarine Cave to get Tyrogue, if you haven't yet. Anyways, talk to Tesla downstairs and start dinner.

She'll offer you food - choose whichever you like. If you want something sweet, you'll get a *Strawberry Cake*! If you want something relaxing, you'll get a *Rose Tea*! If you want something rejuvenating, you'll get an *Herbal Tea*! If you want something sour, you'll get a *Razz Berry Tart*!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- How do you know him? (Neutral)
- Does he deserve this? (-2 Tesla)

Upstairs:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Thank you... (+2 Tesla)
- I don't know what to say... (Neutral)
- ... (-3 Tesla)

Tesla will give you her *Yacht Keys*. Inside the gift box to the left is the *Furret Crest*, *3 Glitter Balls*, *2 Cell Imprints*, *2 Black Prisms*, *12 Moomoo Milks*, *12 Lava Cookies*, and *10 Exp. Candy XL*.

Follow Amber into her room next.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay? (Neutral)
- Stop being a child. (-3 Amber)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm here to help. (+2 Amber)
- What next? (Neutral)

It's worth noting that we can now take the Yacht outside to fast travel between Oceana Pier, Akuwa Town, and Teila Resort. Nice!

## Attacks on Terajuma

Say "Let's go" to fast travel. Once you get control in the cave, head left. It's a bit hard to see. You'll once again regain control: go right and down to escape.

!partner(["Melia",:ENIGMA,1])

This fight will be different depending on our outcome with Madame X earlier. The easier fight occurs if you didn't defeat Madame X:

!dbattle(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,2], ["Bartz",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Crystal Cavern Field")

This should be a fairly straightforward multi-battle, and Melia can hold her own.

If you did defeat Madame X, you'll have this fight:

!dbattle(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,6], ["Bartz",:XENMAGE_M,0], "Crystal Cavern Field")

Another fun battle with a Xen Mage - they can cause all kinds of effects in battle including the above field change!

Back outside on Route 5, grab the hidden *Calcium* by the boat, then go back to Tesla's office in Teila Resort.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We have to. (+1 Melia)
- I don't know... (Neutral)
- Depends on the mood. (-3 if current Melia points < 1, else -1)

Time for a GAUNTLET. That's right. Two battles, back to back, no healing in between.

If you didn't defeat Madame X earlier, you'll have this fight first:

!battle(["Danni",:XENGRUNT_M,1])

If you did defeat Madame X earlier, you'll have this fight with a Mage instead:

!battle(["Harris",:XENMAGE_M,0])

In either case, the second battle will be against Neved:

!battle(["Neved",:XENEXECUTIVE_4,2])

In the villa, talk to Crawli.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's take her down. (+2 Melia, +3 Venam, +2 Aelita, +4 Crawli, +4 Adam, +2 Valarie, +2 Braixen)
- I'd rather not... (-2 Melia, -3 Venam, -1 Aelita, -2 Valarie, -4 Adam, -4 Crawli, -2 Braixen)

Once you're in Frozen Kakori Village, get the hidden *Super Repel* to the left. There are *4 Yache Berries* in the southeast corner. Enter the Ranger HQ and talk to Farha at the top. Meet her on the left island in the Mynori Sea, then take the Kakori Noctowl over to Teila Resort. Enter the villa and talk to the crew.

*Special Scene: Valarie's Insecurity* requires 6+ Relationship Points with both Valarie and Adam at this point.

## Rock Climb Exploration

Before we continue the story, we got sidequests and exploration to do!

First, add something to your party with Headbutt. Surf over to the Jirukala Cavern to the north of Mynori Sea. Rock Climb to the left and go up.

!enc(211)

In the trees here, you can headbutt! You have an 11% chance each to get *3 Oran Berries*, *3 Sitrus Berries*, or *3 Leppa Berries*, but also an 11% chance to get **Greedent**, 22% chance to get Skwovet, and 33% chance to get **Applin**! Grab the *Modest Mint* and *TM133 Mud Shot*. That's all we can do here for now.

Make your way next to Jynnobi Pass. Talk to the girl on the southern balcony to give her *A Souvenir For Mom*. She'll give us the *Fighting Memory* as well as:

**ZCell 064: Jynnobi Pass**

!img("zcell064.png")

Use Noctowl to get over to Helojak Island. On the east side, you can use Rock Climb to reach a hidden *Rare Candy* and **Mudkip**!

Return to Kakori and use the boat to get back to Gearen. 

Remember that impossible fight in the Aqua Building? Well, I was able to beat it at this point, so why not give it a shot. Not essential to get done now, but if you can, why not. All you need is a really strong physical attacker to take advantage of Abra's Trick Room and one-shot Alakazam... or a Shedinja, past Kadabra!

!battle(["Mercury",:CHALLENGER,0])

Winning awards you a *Star Shard*!

The Poke Ball store has added wares.

!shop("Poke Ball Boutique (5 Badges)", ["Heavy Ball", "Moon Ball", "Love Ball", "Fast Ball", "Nest Ball", "Net Ball", "Timer Ball", "Dive Ball", "Friend Ball"])

I recommend taking another trip to the AP shop. If you haven't gotten the Exp. All or the Golden Axe, Hammer, Surfboard, and Claws, do so ASAP. On deck will be the Golden Driftboard and the Golden Gauntlet.

Take the train over to Route 2. Talk to the lady with the Meganium, and since we have five badges, she'll let us have **Chikorita** for the Spinda we got.

Take the truck to Goldenleaf, enter Wispy Tower, and talk to Sariah. She'll give us 3 *Ethers* and start us on a quest for later on. 

Enter Wispy Ruins through the Wispy Tower area entrance. Climb the rocks and head down the ivy by the waterfalls into Wispy Chasm.

!enc(508, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Head all the way down, picking up hidden *Dark Gem* as you go. Around the bottom, step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 6: a **Scraggy**!

Back in the chasm, head towards the middle, then go down to get a *Rare Candy* and *TM65 Shadow Claw*. Go up from here.

!battle(["Kain",:BLACKBELT,0], "Haunted Field")

Surf across up above to get to another gate. Step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 3: a *Shiny Stone*!

Head back up the ivy, enter the room on the right, and go down this ivy. There is a hidden *Yellow Shard*, *Ghost Gem*, and *Reverse Candy*. Grab the *Poke Doll* when you go down. We can't open any more doors for now, so exit the ruins. 

Make your way back to Akuwa Town. Enter Evergreen Forest and climb the rocks to get an *Icy Rock* and *TM32 Double Team*!

## Amethyst Depths

Take the truck to Sheridan Village and enter Amethyst Cave. In the second room, Rock Climb down. Talk to April, then activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 3 to the right. Grab the hidden *Rock Gem*, *Steel Gem,* and *Water Gem*, then follow her left.

**ZCell 065: Amethyst Cave**

!img("zcell065.png")

Talk to April again, then enter the room in the top left. Surf left, activate the panel if you haven't, and get *TM01 Work Up* below.

Return to the entrance of the cave from Route 2. Take the stairs to the right, then head across the first bridge on top. Rock climb here, pick up the hidden *Zinc*, and head in.

!enc(162, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Exit on the bottom doors to the left to meet Alisha, the tenth of the *Lost Souls* for the sidequest. There is a hidden *Carbos* here.

Back up from here, grab the *Elixir* and enter the cave on the left.

!boss("AMETHYSTREGIROCK", "Crystal Cavern")

Not impossible if you can lower its attack with a burn or something similar! Grab *TM69 Rock Polish*, activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 4, then head to the upper right door and enter for a similar battle!

!boss("AMETHYSTREGISTEEL", "Crystal Cavern")

Grab the *Moon Dial* and activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 5 here, then head down the ladder on the left. 

Grab hidden *Rock Gem*, *Super Repel*, and *Ether*.

Talk to the ex-Xen Grunt in the open area. Head down the ladder here and activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 6 on the right.

Head down and rock climb down from here. We're gonna need to smash the crystals in this new area somehow: the wild Geodude have Magnitude and can do it, alternatively, if you have the Bulldoze TM, then you can use that. Once you succeed, head down to the bottom of this area and interact with this crystal for a chance to catch **Aevian Lapras!**

With all six panels activated, head back to the Xen grunt and activate the machine. The Xen guy will head up, so grab the hidden *PP Up* and climb the ladder. Grab the *Code Feris Rift Notes* and prepare yourself.

Talk to the Grunt and save in front of the statue. Talk to the grunt again, and you'll have to fight:

!battle(["Nancy",:SUPERSTAR,0], "Mountain Field")

The Tailwind makes this otherwise somewhat slow team outspeed you, but stalling it out tends to lead to an easy sweep for a physical Poison or Steel type.

!boss("RIFTCHANDELURE", "Mountain Field")

With three shields, it takes a lot to defeat Rift Chandelure. It has an insane Special Attack stat, with Shadow Ball and Air Slash consistently and a different special STAB at each phase. Since it recovers stat changes at each stage, status conditions are especially key here. With only 99 HP and 69 Def its physical bulk is nothing to write home about - with a new held gem at each phase, I recommend going the fully powered Knock Off. You also have the power of 'cheese' in your pocket thanks to the Trace ability - at each phase you can brick it with a harmful ability like Truant! 

Exit at the top and talk to Manny. He'll give you a *Shiny Stone*. Hidden around here is a *Rare Candy*, *Elixir*, *Iron*, and *Resist Wing*.

At night, you'll find:

**ZCell 066: Cliffside Grave**

!img("zcell066.png")

Interact with the grave at the top and insert the Cursed Candle we got a while ago to obtain **Litwick**!

With that, return to the room where April is, two maps away from Sheridan. Talk to April. She'll give us the *Phase Dial*! Head in and go up.

!boss("BOSS_CHAOTICFUSION", "Starlight Arena")

!move("SOLARFLARE")

!move("HOARFROSTMOON")

This fight has you oscillating between the forms of Solrock and Lunatone. Interestingly, even as the moveset entirely changes, once the boss commits to using a certain move during a turn, they will use it. This means that breaking a shield while Solrock is dominant and before it attacks will see it use a physical attack while Lunatone is dominant and vice versa - which can be the opening you need to get past its large stats.

We can now use the Phase Dial on our own Solrock and Lunatone to obtain the fusion! Nice. 

Back in Sheridan, go west onto Route 3 and enter the Mirage Woods. Make your way to the Mirage Cave where we once fought Crobat. Use Rock Climb to get the *Data Drive*, *3 Exp. Candy L*, and:

**ZCell 067: Mirage Cave**

!img("zcell067.png")

## Church of Theolia

To progress the story, take the submarine from Mynori Sea. Follow the path through Kristiline Town and enter the church. At the fork, go right.

**ZCell 068: Church of Theolia**

!img("zcell068.png")

Go up now. You'll awaken in the Tower of Theolia. There is a butterfly that can warp you to Teila Resort if you need to exit for any reason.

!shop("Tower of Theolia", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Super Potion", "Full Heal", "Antidote", "Ice Heal", "Paralyze Heal", "GourmetTreat", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Reverse Candy"])

Enter the tower. 

!enc(344)

Follow the path up. Smash the wall to the left. Follow the path all the way to a shiny key on the ground. Double back from here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Fail to defeat Madame X and the first Tapu Koko fight (-3 Crescent)

Return to the room with the bed and use the key.

In the room with the silk, interact with the small pods to fight **Orbeetle**, **Vespiquen**, and Whirlipede.

!boss("BELIAL", "Frozen Dimensional Field")

This Volcarona is incredibly fast, hits hard, recovers Leftovers, refreshes stat drops and status, and even makes a last ditch field change to Flower Garden. Despite all this, it is still very weak to Rock moves, so if you have speed control and one of those you can come out on top here.

Talk to Crawli to get a key.

!battle(["Amelia",:SERVANT,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

Study the sign nearby. You can drop a ladder here before proceeding. Talk to Bonita to start the Big Show. Answer the questions to the best of your ability, or you will perish:

!battle(["Mabeline",:SERVANT,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

...and, you have to try again. You'll need to get at least six right to proceed. Take the warp to proceed.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Free Kreiss (+2 Kreiss)
- Keep Kreiss locked up (-2 Kreiss)

Drop another ladder when you get outside. Back at the bottom, you can now get *6 Sitrus Berries* and *5 Yache Berries*.

Reenter the Cellar. It is now frozen, so you can slide around. Follow the first hole in the wall, then in the top left, smash a wall to get *TM79 Frost Breath* and a hidden *Elemental Seed*! Enter the room at the bottom to get a hidden *Blue Shard* and fight a servant.

!battle(["Nadia",:SERVANT,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

Continue right, then emerge back in the icy area. Sliiiiiiide to the right to get *NeverMeltIce*. To the right again is an *Herbal Tea* and hidden *Max Repel*

Slide your way through the gap at the bottom of the room. Grab the *Fluffy Tail* and talk to the girl for an *Ability Capsule*. Hidden here, and going left is a *Max Repel*, *Ultra Potion*, *Yellow Shard*, *Blue Shard*, and *Rare Candy*. In the bottom left pick up the *Black Prism* and another hidden *Rare Candy*, then smash the wall to get a *Rash Mint* and *3 Exp. Candy L*.

On the right side of the room, get hidden *Green Shard* and *Revive* and pick up an *X Speed*. Smash a wall to get a *Modest Mint*. You'll also find:

**ZCell 069: Tower Cellar**

!img("zcell069.png")

Head back up from the previous room. In this central hub, go right next. Get the hidden *Ice Gem* and pick up the *Ice Heal*. That's all for the cellar area right now, so head back up the tower to where we left off.

We next have to solve a series of complicated mirror puzzles. The steps you'll need to take:

- Break the mirror tile directly above the ladder on the right, then enter.
- Push the the statue onto the red tile (you can reset by talking to the maid).
- Return to the previous room, then climb the ladder in the bottom left.
- Move the statue around the table clockwise. Once you pass to the top side, you'll notice that it will move the crack in the wall! Continue pushing it right until the mirror shatters, then proceed. 
- Talk to the maid in this room to reset the statue: doing so puts the statue in the previous room only two tiles away from the red dot. Simply push the statue in this room once left and once down, then return to the previous room and climb the ladder.
- In this next room, you can smash through the mirror to enter a door to the left for an optional scene. 
- Head straight down, into a door opposite the previous. 
- Push the statue: even when it cannot move, the corresponding ladder will still move. Push it from these directions: 3D 9L 2U. Go up the ladder in the previous room.

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,2])

!dbattle(["Mary",:SERVANT,0], ["Sarah",:SERVANT,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

Go up when you can. Back outside, drop another ladder. Head up when you are ready!

!battle(["Angie",:LEADER_ANGIE,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

!move("COLDTRUTH")

This fight is very difficult. The Frozen Dimensional Field makes the Ice and Dark attacks that she uses a lot stronger, on top of permanent hail plus a signature move that hits both of your Pokemon hard and even afflicts Torment. There is some bulk, some speed, lots of coverage, and lots of synergy, but a well constructed team can take her down. 

For starters, the boost to Dark moves like Knock Off makes them one of the most viable options against her. Changing the weather is very helpful, though we don't have any of the TMs yet. Wide Guard, Brick Break, and Protect are all moves that can be very helpful in this battle, as well. I also recommend using the Elemental Seed to your own advantage - Cold Truth might afflict Torment anyways, so take advantage of the double speed when you need it in this fight.

Run away from Angie! That's it for Chapter 7!
