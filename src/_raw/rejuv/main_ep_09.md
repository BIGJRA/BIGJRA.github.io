- We should go. (-1 Amber)

To put a bow on the events on Valor Mountain, there is an optional event we can take care of right now. Head over to Aquamarine Cave and go to the area where Jenner once was hiding. You'll see a pink butterfly.

!battle(["Jenner",:SPIRITJENNER,0], "Concert Venue")

For winning, you'll get *3 Blue Shards*, *3 Red Shards*, *3 Green Shards*, *3 Black Prisms*, *3 Exp. Candy XL*, and *TM92 Trick Room*!

Anyways, to continue the story, take Noctowl over to Kakori and talk to Crawli. Next, make your way to the Church of Theolia on Kristiline's Isle of Angels. Accept the fast travel request to Valor Mountain.

## Forest of Time

- Team Xen (-3 Melia)
- Type a guess (Neutral)

If you typed "Forest", when you go inside:

!enc(118, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

In this lower area there is also a hidden *Calcium* and *Reverse Candy*.

Head up and surf to the left.

**ZCell 090: Forest of Time**

!img("zcell090.png")

Surf to the right, then rock climb down to get *TM40 Aerial Ace*!

Talk to Venam and Melia.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If you didn't trust Jenner, say "It's okay!" (Venam +3, Melia +3)
- If you didn't trust Jenner, say "Sorta awkward." (Neutral)

So begins Rejuvenations next major twist... time travel!

## Past Aevium

You can use this crystal to head back to the present anytime you want.

After they run off, we can explore Kugearen City! The teacher in the house to the left will give you a *Quick Claw*. In the house down from the stairs, grab a *Revive*. In the building above the Pokemon Center, talk to the kid on 2F and answer his quiz to get a *Leaf Stone*.

!shop("Kugearen City Mart", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Super Potion", "Hyper Potion", "Antidote", "Ice Heal", "Gourmet Treat", "Repel", "Super Repel", "Max Repel"])

Head out through the northwest to Route 3.

!enc(236, nil, ["Old", "Good"], "Route 3 (Past)")

Pick up the hidden *Soda Pop*.

!battle(["Anna",:GHOSTGIRL,0])

Continuing along, there is a hidden *Aguav Berry*, *Soda Pop*, and *Protein*. 

!battle(["Sam",:YOUNGMONEY,0])

Grab the *Full Heal* at the top.

Head up to Ambrette Town and enter the upper left estate. Head upstairs. Talk to the box to change clothes! There is also a PC and bed to heal in the upper left room. Talk to Melia in the upper right corner.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Beautiful! (Melia +2)
- Stylish! (Melia +2)
- It's alright. (Melia +1)
- Yikes. (Melia -2)

Sit in the open chair around the table downstairs to play through the scene. Then, talk to Irvin and the gang in the lab to the right.

Head to Kugearen City afterwards by talking to the truck driver. Enter the cafe at the bottom.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It was excellent! (Venam +2)
- It was alright. (Venam -1)
- Awful. (Venam +2)

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM2,1])

!battle(["Kanon",:MYSTMAGE,0])

You'll have to choose one Pokemon to battle Kanon, but you don't need to win this one. Well, head out, and talk to Venam in the square. Head east.

!enc(240)

!battle(["Ellie",:LADYGIRL,0])

Head into a forest a bit and you'll have to fend off wild Shiftry. Continue to explore the forest:

!battle(["Andy",:BUGCATCH,0])

!battle(["Stallfoss",:BUGCATCH,0])

Down and to the right from here is 4 *Rawst Berries* and a hidden *Zinc*. Head up into Marble Garden.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yeah! (Venam +2)
- Nah. (Venam -1)

Enter the house and after a scene, you'll be free to explore. Talk to Anathea in the garden for a optional scene. Exit to the woods.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's do this. (Venam +4)
- What about Melia? (Neutral)
- I dunno... (Venam -2)

Head back to the city and enter the house in the bottom right of town. Next, enter Blakeory Co. in the southwest. After the meeting, enter the forest again. Head south to follow the policeman.

Go to the northeast for a *Rare Candy* and a *Leppa Berry*. Hidden nearby is *Honey*. On your way to the south, you'll get 2 *Cheri Berries.

!battle(["Tania",:WITCH,0])

!battle(["Laila",:LADYGIRL,0])

Pick up the *Revive* and *2 Oran Berries*.

!battle(["Ned",:YOUNGMONEY,0])

Pluck the *2 Aspear Berries* at the very top. Eavesdrop on the conversation: you'll have to fight Gardevoir!

!boss("DARKGARDEVOIR")

This boss is very fast and hits hard. Speed control is crucial here - the funniest way to win is taking advantage of Magician by forcing it to eat Lum Berry and then letting it steal an item like the Iron Ball. After this, simply hit hard with massive physical damage, ideally Steel or Poison type moves.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Worried? (Venam +2)
- Scared? (Venam -2)
- Taking too long to find me? (Venam +3)

Grab the shiny *Apartment Key*. This next part is optional, but worth doing due to ramifications on the story later. Head back to Kugearen and use the key on the door in the top left of the area. Head down and read the book on the table. After that, head to the right and read this book to get the *Weird Diary*.

Continuing the story, talk to Venam by Katsu's house, then return to the mansion.

!battle(["Jinene",:SERVANT,0])

Talk to the maid in the garden.

!battle(["Adina",:SERVANT,0])

Interact with the statues in the four rooms up and down from the garden: top left facing right, top right facing down, bottom right facing left, bottom left facing up. Head upstairs and enter the newly opened door. Grab the **Indeedee** here! Talk to the portrait in this room to begin a puzzle.

!img("mariapuzzle.png")

This is what it should look like when completed. Enter the door downstairs and go down.Head down and follow the prompts. Choose whether to save the Officer, or to save Maria. 

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Attempt to save Maria (+4 Anathea)
- Save the officer (Neutral)

Either head down to untie the officer, or up to save Maria. After the scene, head outside into the forest, and then to Kugearen City. Pick North or West, but watch the scene play out. Then pick Blakeory Co.

!battle(["Lia",:SERVANT,0])

Talk to Melia in the kitchen to get some sleep.

!battle(["Karrina",:GANGLEADER,1])

Enter the new grove to return to the past. We can use this crystal to go back to the past whenever we want.

## West Gearen City Sewers

Talk to Venam outside to board the boat.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- About a 5. (Neutral)
- About a 3. (Neutral)
- About a 7. (Venam +1)
- About a 10. (Venam +2, Melia +1)

Make land in West Gearen. You can find a hidden *Mystery Bowl* in the skinny ledge to the left, overlooking the sea. Above to the left of a factory is a *Data Drive* and hidden *Magnet*. Enter the West Gearen Sewers below.

After a lot of talking, head down and follow the path. After more talking, head out to the left then try to enter the gate at the bottom. Enter the room above and to the left and talk to the machine. Go downstairs.

!battle(["Nathan",:SCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

Pick up *TM84 Poison Jab*. Change the water level down from here, then head up.

!battle(["Lenny",:SCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

Grab the *PP Up* and enter the upper right door.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Bye. (Erick -2)
- We're here to help! (Erick +2)

Grab *TM129 Fake Tears*. Head through the gate to downstairs.

!enc(415)

Toxel is our next target for Zumi's quest.

!battle(["Orion",:SCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

Grab the *Hyper Potion* in here. Head up, then grab the *Code Corroso Rift Notes*! After heading up, show Erick the Weird Diary if you want to save Garbodor (+1 Karma). To not **Save Garbodor** adds (+10 Renegade Points).

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's save Garbodor! (Venam +4, Melia +4)
- Ugh... Why me? (Melia -4, Venam -4, Erick -4)
- How about tomorrow? (Erick +1)

!partner(["Melia",:ENIGMA_1,0])

!boss("RIFTGARBODOR", "Corrupted Cave")

The most annoying thing about this boss is its recovery. Garbodor heals a ton of HP every turn on the field, and has the defenses to make dealing damage very difficult. With cured stat drops, changing typings, and refreshed items, there is a lot to deal with!

Melia as a partner is fairly helpful. Her Snorlax is a good lead that takes a while to die and is immune to the field's Poison effect, so that helps. She's able to do decent damage with Ground type moves, which the latter two phases of the boss are 4x weak to! Generally speaking you want to be doing what you can to prolong Melia's effectiveness while supressing Garbodor's offensive power if you can. It is so slow that it will basically always move last, so you can take advantage of this to use moves like Knock Off and Heal Block.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're on! (Erick +2)
- Gotta go... (Erick -2)

Once we regain control, head back down into the sewers, where we can now get:

**ZCell 091: West Gearen Sewers**

!img("zcell091.png")

## West Gearen City

!enc(239, nil, ["Old", "Good"], "West Gearen City (North)")

Enter the power plant at the top. In the door to the left, head up. Pick up the *Metal Coat* here. Head down the stairs: for a quest, gather 5 Electric types, and 5 Fire types to donate. The easiest way to do this is to breed a Pokemon of each type and take all their babies back. Return to each person with the 5 Pokemon to get the *Electirizer* and *Magmarizer*. Pick up 2 *Cell Batteries* next to the Electrodes.

Head down from the factory and go left.

!battle(["Kasey",:CAMPER,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Nathanial",:YOUNGSTER,0], "City Field")

**ZCell 092: West Gearen City**

!img("zcell092.png")

Use your Itemfinder to find a *Rose Incense* and *Lemonade*. You'll also find Tyreese for the *Lost Souls* quest, so send him to the Lost Camp!

Head south into the city proper.

!battle(["Luke",:TECH,0], "City Field")

!enc(238, nil, ["Old", "Good"], "West Gearen City (South)")

There's a woman selling *Blast Powder* for $25000. It's pretty expensive, but these are hard to come by right now, so buy it!

**ZCell 093: West Gearen City**

!img("zcell093.png")

!battle(["Dacabe",:CHARMER,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Sughou",:OPT,0], "City Field")

!battle(["GLM-T04-171",:TECH,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Sarudo",:KIMONOGIRL,0], "City Field")

Use your Itemfinder all around the city. You'll find a *Telluric Seed*, *Yellow Shard*, *2 Max Repels*, *Dusk Stone*, *Float Stone*, *Green Shard*, *Zinc*, *Muscle Wing*, *Red Shard*, and *GourmetTreat*.

Cut the upper left tree to get *TM21 Frustration*!

Enter Gearen News HQ. In the bottom left you'll find a *Hyper Potion*. Also, there's a breeder here: win to get *5 Exp. Candy L*.

!battle(["Zed",:POKEBREEDER_M,0])

Grab the *Wide Lens* in the upper right, then exit. Next, enter the bottom-right-most house in West Gearen. A guy will trade you *Protective Pads* for three Absorb Bulbs.

Enter the building to the left to finish the Virtual League quest! All we have to do is beat the entire Johto Elite Four and Champion with our preset team... but now our starter has its corresponding Crest! Very cool.

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,8], "Virtual Trainer (Chikorita)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,18], "Virtual Trainer (Cyndaquil)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,28], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

!battle(["Will",:JOHTO_9,0], "Glitch Field")

!battle(["Koga",:JOHTO_10,0], "Glitch Field")

!battle(["Bruno",:JOHTO_11,0], "Glitch Field")

!battle(["Karen",:JOHTO_12,0], "Glitch Field")

!battle(["Lance",:JOHTO_13,0], "Glitch Field")

If you succeed, you'll get the corresponding crest to your starter in the challenge: the *Meganium Crest*, *Typhlosion Crest*, or *Feraligatr Crest*! You'll also get 25 AP Points and a *Somniam Mall Stamp*! We will eventually find out what this stamp does.

It is worth noting that the other two crests now become available for purchase at the Kecleon Bazaar for $50,000 each.

To the left, in a building with a red facade:

!shop("WG Rare Fossil Shop", ["Old Amber", "Cover Fossil", "Plume Fossil"])

Head outside and enter the Junction Bridge from the left.

**ZCell 094: Junction Bridge**

!img("zcell094.png")

Head over to East Gearen City from here. A store has new wares:

!shop("Berry Emporium (5 Badges)", ["Oran Berry", "Pecha Berry", "Rawst Berry", "Chesto Berry", "Cheri Berry", "Aspear Berry", "Sitrus Berry", "Occa Berry"])

This means we can now easily complete the trades on the Isle of Angels for Deepseatooth and Deepseascale.

Next, return to the Magnolia Library and show Zumi your Pokedex with Toxel inside. She'll give us *15 Exp. Candy M*, as well as tell you a hint about one way to evolve it. Our next objective for *PictoZumi* is a special Aevian Forme somewhere in the badlands. We'll get that taken care of later on.

Return to the help center in West Gearen.

## West Gearen City Help Quests

### Generator Problems

This quest is only available if you have freed Dufaux: it is a continuation of the *Narcissa's Hauntings* quest.

Start at the power plant on the north side and talk to Gabriel. Head inside to see what's happened. Carefully sneak to the left and into the generator room. Save and use F12 if you get spotted to reduce the backtracking.

Make your way to the generator room and watch all the events unfold. Narcissa will leave for Goldenleaf Town. Take the truck there, then talk to young Narcissa. Grab something from the PC with either Dark Pulse or Night Daze: the Lv. 50 Spiritomb we caught earlier comes with the former. Anyways, once Narcissa leaves, head over to Phasial Cave on Route 3. Towards the left side of the area, you can Rock Climb to reach a ladder we haven't gone down yet. Talk to young Narcissa down here, then use your Dark-type move to transform the field. Talk to her at the top once more, then grab the *Ability Capsule* to the right.

That's all we can do for this quest, for now, so return to West Gearen. Claim your reward at the Help Center: $3500. We can now access the generator room in the Power Plant whenever we want: it houses *TM64 Explosion* and the *Electric Memory*. Note that we can evolve electrical-location-based Pokemon here: Nosepass and Magneton.

### House Sitting

Start at Saki's house west of the power plant. Talk to Erina, go in, and read the note on the table. Do three of the actions, then head upstairs.

!dbattle(["Neville",:TEAMAA_M,0], ["Kalista",:TEAMAA_F,0])

Defeat the AA Grunts, then do three more actions. Head upstairs and into Saki's room on the right. Read the diary at the bottom. Re-enter the house, and head up and right.

Claim your reward: $5500.

### Hidden Library 3

Start at the Gearen Park and enter the hidden library. Head all the way up and to the back. Talk to Karen.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sure. (+1 Karen)
- What's in it for me? (-2 Karen)
- Ok. (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- What the heck is happening? (-2 Karen)
- You're a good mother. (+5 Karen)
- She's just being a teen! (+1 Karen)

Talk to Karrina outside the door, then head into the east wing. The key you're looking for is in a box of papers in the top left. Enter the west wing. Karen will attack you if you stand in the middle column, so carefully make your way to the top. Grab *TM77 Psych Up* to the left while you're at it.

Of course, Karen makes us do it AGAIN, and now we can be attacked from anywhere. One more round where Diancie chases you. Once you succeed, grab the *Ancient Teachings* and proceed.

!battle(["Karrina",:GANGLEADER,2], "Blessed Field")

Different typings on these Pokemon don't necessarily make them stronger, just different.

Welcome to Atebit Town!? 

!enc(293, nil, nil, "Atebit Town")

To the left is *Exp. Candy XL*. In "The Funky Forest" to the right, stepping on red flowers warps you back to the beginning. Inside the maze is a *Time Flute*, *Rare Candy*, and *Carbos*. A hill to the left of the forest holds a *Black Prism*. Enter Alice's Abode.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes, I have. (Neutral)
- No. (Neutral)
- YES, I have. (+1 Alice, +1 Allen)

Enter the Funky Forest to the east once more. You can find Alice at the end of the maze. After talking to them in the house, make your way through the Funky Forest one final time.

!battle(["ALLEN",:JOHTO_1,0], "Glitch Field")

Enter the cave and solve the tile puzzle. It's the same Kabuto one as in HGSS.

!img("kabuto.png")

Head up and step on the right tile. You'll get the *Banettite* or the *Heracronite*, though we can't use them yet.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Finish Hidden Library 3 after completing the Karrina Gang sidequest (+4 Karrina)

You can reenter the room at the back of the west wing to get a hidden *Charcoal*. Return to the West Gearen Help Center to be granted $4000.

As a reward for finishing all the quests, you'll get a **Turtwig** egg (+1 Karma)!

## Spector Battle Quest

Time for another quest. This one will require that we've done Narcissa's quest up to this point. Take the truck to Goldenleaf.

Before that though, go to the Wispy Ruins via Wispy Tower area entrance. To the right, step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 8: an *Elemental Seed*! 

Back in Goldenleaf, do the following:

1.  Talk to Spector in front of the Giratina statue in town
2.  Head into Wispy Tower. Talk to Spector in here.
3.  Head into the Lost Castle to talk to Spector in the upper room.
4.  Head into Narcissa's gym. Head through the backstage theatre as normal and talk to Spector when you see him.
5.  Finally, meet him in the gym auditorium for a battle!

There are two possible battles for Spector: the first happens during the day: 

!battle(["Spector",:LEADER_SPECTOR,0], "Haunted Field")

This is a very tricky battle! He doesn't focus on raw strength; his Mega Banette is really his only strong Pokemon. Instead, he will try to wear you down. The initial duo of Murkrow and Gothitelle forces you to stay in and stick around for a Perish Song unless you can knock out Gothitelle in the first three turns of the battle. Luckily Gothitelle will usually go for Fake Out on turn one, so one of your Pokemon will likely get in at least one hit. Once you deal with the first pair, Ninetales is particularly annoying because of its speed and increased accuracy on Hypnosis, paired with Mega Banette to knock you out, this is deadly. All in all, a tricky fight, but you can get around the specific sleep + perish song-oriented strategies with Safeguard, Taunt, and other similar moves if you must.

The second possible battle happens at night:

!battle(["Spector",:LEADER_SPECTOR2,0], "Haunted Field")

This second battle is an offensively focused doubles team on the Haunted Field. He has tons of powerful spread moves in Eruption, Heat Wave, Rock Slide, etc. and also many priority moves. He has lots of speed tiers on his team, though a Shadow Sneak of your own can deal with Typhlosion. Some speed control such as Tailwind plus some strong spread moves should do the trick here.

Win to get the *Ghost Memory*. If you completed the nighttime fight, you'll also get *2 Ghost Gems* and *3 Kasib Berries*.

## Lost Souls 2

Take the truck to Akuwa Town. At the ACDMC you can now revive **Aerodactyl**, **Archen**, and **Tirtouga**!

Make your way over to Route 4. Now that we've beaten Amber, all four of the Rift Dens we've seen so far have been updated with new Pokemon!

!raid(1, 8)

!raid(2, 8)

!raid(3, 8)

!raid(4, 8)

Entering Cairo's house, he has more available crests now!

!shop("Cairo's Shop New Items (8 Badges)", [["Luxray Crest", "5000 Red Essences"], ["Druddigon Crest", "5000 Red Essences"], ["Thievul Crest", "5000 Red Essences"], ["Samurott Crest", "5000 Red Essences"]])

Next, head over to the Lost Camp. We've now found all eleven children for the *Lost Souls* quest! 

!shop("Lost Camp: Alisha", ["TinyMushroom", "Magnet", "Stardust", "Absorb Bulb"])

Maman will ask for another donation: $16,000, to be exact.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Mosely... (Neutral)
- She's probably exhausted. (+2 Mosely)

Mosely will run off to the Hospital of Hope, which we will visit later.

## Pulse Badge

Enter the Power Plant in West Gearen, then go downstairs.

!battle(["Amanda",:TRAINER_AMANDA,2], "Factory Field")

The good news is the field doesn't really do anything for her team in this battle, so if you can exploit Factory Field for your own benefit, go ahead. The bad news is her team is particularly good at what it does overall. You'll notice that Trick Room is the central strategy she employs here: you can take advantage of that and bring in your own heavy hitting slow team, or prevent it from being used. One strategy is to open with Pokemon immune to the Fake Out from Incineroar in some way, another is to have a Multi-hit move strong enough to ORKO Hatterene, and so on. If you can succeed and make sure Bronzong similarly goes down before it can use Trick Room, you will have an easy time here.

Head up for the gym battle!

!battle(["Erick",:LEADER_ERICK,0], "Murkwater Surface")

!move("THUNDERRAID")

Time for a gym fight with Erick. The field might seem like an interesting choice, but it does grant him some advantages: Ground moves are nullified, Electric moves are boosted, and he has two Steel types to deal with the Poison effects. This makes it hard to pin down his weaknesses, so you'll want to consider dealing heavy damage in other ways. Priority moves are helpful against his very fast Pokemon, while Doubles moves like Dazzling Gleam and Rock Slide can spread damage quickly. 

Win to get the Pulse Badge, increasing our level cap to Lv. 65, and *TM72 Volt Switch*. Make your way outside.
