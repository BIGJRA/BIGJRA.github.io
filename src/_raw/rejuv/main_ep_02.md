# Chapter 2: Redemption

Head outside of the lab and talk to Karrina. She'll want us to go to the Junction Bridge on the left side of the city, so accept the fast travel to get there.

Head into the lab to battle Dr. Jenkel, with a choice of ally between Ren and Venam.

!partner(["Ren",:TRAINER_REN,7])

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,7])

!battle(["Dr. Jenkel",:MADSCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

Either partner will do well here, his Frogadier hits hard with Water Pulse and Misty Terrain boosted Icy Wind, while her Grimer can smack super effective STAB on each with Knock Off and Poison Fang. Low stats including abysmal speed prevents Musharna from doing much damage - stall out the screens from the Munna if you need to and hit Musharna hard with STAB moves and you'll be just fine.

After the battle, you'll be gifted *TM94 Rock Smash*! Now that we have this TM, we can use Rock Smash in the field. Use it to go down and right, and you'll see a **Blitzle**. Give it a GourmetTreat and it'll battle you! On the way out, head into Jenkel's lab one more time and pick up *6 Cell Batteries*! Make sure you save three of them for a quest in chapter 8.

## Team Xen Gearen Takeover

To the right of Junction Bridge, you'll notice the sewer stairs east of the Violet Building will now be open. Head down.

!battle(["Arnold",:TECH,0])

Here you'll find a **Rare Candy**. Also:

**ZCell 005: Abandoned Sewers**

!img("zcell005.png")

Exit through the top. Inside the wall of the building immediately to your right is a hidden *Reverse Candy*. Head up to watch the scene.

The third tile from the right on the top row of grass hides a *Green Shard*, while a hidden *Super Potion* is just to the left of the top dumpster. Two tiles left of the top-left grass is a hidden *Red Shard*,  while a hidden *Super Repel* is three tiles left of the bottom-left grass. Down the stairs and below the dumpsters is a hidden *Telluric Seed*.

**ZCell 006: Gearen Alleyway**

!img("zcell006.png")

Go up and give one of the **Munna** a GourmetTreat to catch it!

Return to the main part of the city, and enter the Help Center. Now that we've obtained 5+ Zygarde Cells, talk to Ayuda to get *TM49 Echoed Voice*. Our next checkpoint is getting 10.

You'll note that Team Xen Grunts are swarming East Gearen. In the northwest:

!battle(["Laurel",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "City Field")

Catch her **Shadow Vanillite**! To the east of the library:

!battle(["Orran",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "City Field")

Catch his **Shadow Wooper** and **Shadow Pidove**! Up from here:

!battle(["Yanny",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "City Field")

Catch her **Shadow Bonsly**! On the right side of East Gearen, east of the Poke Mart:

!battle(["Teepo",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Vera",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "City Field")

One more quest we can do now takes place at the Chrisola Hotel.

Enter the room in the right hallway on the right, with Minccino in it. Talk to the old lady and agree to find Minccino.

Head out to the lobby and find it near the elevator. Then enter the left hallway and you'll see it right away on the bottom side. Follow it left and around, and you'll see Team Xen Grunts take it away!

Go to Gearen Park and fight the Grunts on the east side of the park.

!dbattle(["Wilbur",:XENGRUNT_M,0], ["Hayleigh",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Grassy Terrain")

Return to the old woman in the hotel, who'll let you battle to catch **Minccino**!

Especially if you've been catching all the Pokemon so far, you probably will have enough AP to get the Golden Hammer. This makes it so we don't need to teach Rock Smash to any Pokemon in order to smash rocks!

There are Pokemon in trees in the next area. If you want, bring a Pokemon with Headbutt to the next area, either Seel or Litleo work great.

This is all we can do in the city for now, so buy a $300 ticket to take the train east to Route 2!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You guys alright? (Venam -1)
- Cheer up, guys... (Ren +1)
- ... (Neutral)

## Route 2

There's a *Carbos* right and down from the purple flower on the left as you enter. 

!enc(199, ["Grass", "Headbutt"])

Remember to to get Dedenne to continue the *PictoZumi* quest. We'll also need to trade away one Aipom for a quest later. The next gym is fighting type, so most of these are going to be decent options for now.

!battle(["Ruddie",:AROMALADY,0])

The grassy spot in the middle of dirt right from Meganium hides a *Green Shard*. The end of a narrow path to the left of this trainer hides a *Repel*. The bush to the right hides a *Green Shard*. Up the stairs, a bush hides a *Red Shard*. To the left is an RV - one tile left and two down from the nearby cut tree is a hidden *Friend Ball*.

If you talk to the painter here, he'll start us on the *Artist Quest*. He wishes to see Cherrim. At some point, level a Cherubi to Level 25 so that it evolves into **Cherrim**. Show it to this guy to get a *Miracle Seed*. He'll want to see Magcargo next, so we'll have to come back later.

Enter the cave here.

!enc(133)

**ZCell 007: Gemstream Cave** (Night Only)

!img("zcell007.png")

Exit the cave to the right. Go up at the fork in the bridge. On the first "tier" of grass and flowers, the rightmost tile hides a *Relaxed Mint*. The second tier's rightmost tile hides a *Rose Incense*.

**ZCell 008: Route 2**

!img("zcell008.png")

Continue crossing the bridge and enter the next cave, then go down the ladder. This room has three exits. The middle one will take you to water on Route 2.

!enc(199, ["Fishing"], ["Old"])

Take the bottom exit. You'll come upon a Mystery Egg at the end of the path. The contents of this egg are randomly decided upon creating your game file, so you can't reset for a different Pokemon. It will be one of **Skiddo**, **Mudbray**, or **Ponyta (Galarian)**, randomly determined. An *Ability Capsule* is hidden in a rock beyond.

Reenter the cave and exit at the top. Down and to the right are some stairs - up one tile and right two tiles is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Head down from here.

!battle(["Kaius",:YOUNGSTER,0])

Two tiles down and two tiles right from the next set of stairs is a hidden *Level Ball*.

!battle(["Connald",:FISHERMAN,0])

Five tiles down from the door is a hidden *Lemonade*.

**ZCell 009: Route 2**

!img("zcell009.png")

Go left. There is a blank tile with tall grass on four sides but on no diagonals that hides an *Exp. Candy S*. 

**ZCell 010: Route 2**

!img("zcell010.png")

Go up.

!battle(["Jiara",:BEAUTY,0])

A wall above her on the right contains a hidden *Ether*.

!battle(["Hinata",:TOURIST,0])

The path above is now clear, so you have a shorter path to traverse through Route 2. Return to the Kecleon Bazaar on the south side of the Route. On the right, you'll be able to purchase a *Magnetic Lure* for $2000. This item makes it so you will encounter Pokemon you haven't caught yet when held, which is fantastic for a 100% playthrough.

The four items of inventory on the left are determined randomly each day - a number is picked from 1-8. You'll get one set of the following:

1. *Super Potion* ($500), *Pomeg Berry* ($8,500), *Protein* ($6,800), *Black Prism* ($25,000),
2. *Max Revive* ($9,500), *Kelpsy Berry* ($8,500), *HP Up* ($6,800), *Ice Stone* ($25,000),
3. *Full Heal* ($200), *Qualot Berry* ($8,500), *Iron* ($6,800), *Link Heart* ($25,000),
4. *Max Potion* ($1,500), *Hondew Berry* ($8,500), *Calcium* ($6,800), *Galarica Cuff* ($25,000),
5. *Lava Cookie* ($50), *Tamato Berry* ($8,500), *Zinc* ($6,800), *Galarica Wreath* ($25,000),
6. *Ice Heal* ($50), *Grepa Berry* ($8,500), *Carbos* ($6,800), *Dusk Stone* ($25,000),
7. *Full Restore* ($1,600), *Sitrus Berry* ($500), *PP Up* ($12,800), *Dawn Stone* ($25,000),
8. *Revive* ($1,000), *Leppa Berry* ($1,500), *PP Max* ($20,800), *Shiny Stone* ($25,000).

The evolution items are of course nice for early evolutions for team members that need them. If you are lucky enough to find one, buy a single Protein for a quest later (don't use it or sell it). Head to the top right side of the route.

!enc(199, ["Rock Smash"])

Behind the healing machine and a rock is a hidden *GourmetTreat*. Enter the cave here.

## Amethyst Cave

After a conversation with a shady figure, you'll have control in the cave.

!enc(4, ["Cave", "Fishing", "Rock Smash"], ["Old"])

Go left. Two tiles down and one left from the lady hides a *Nugget*. To the left and pick up the *Quiet Mint*, and the *Mineral Ball* hidden in the bottom right part of the nearby cart. Down from here, the divot in the wall contains a hidden *Green Shard*.

Head to the right, and downstairs. This is a new area technically with different encounters.

!enc(77, ["Cave"])

Again, Xatu is another good choice for the upcoming gym.

The wall below the second Joltik contains a hidden *HP Up*. Talk to Ren.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Is that strange? (Ren +1)
- What about them? (Neutral)

The rock below him contains a *Potion*, and one tile down from the box to the left is a hidden *Antidote*. Crossing the bridge, the bottom left box of the set on the right contains a *Green Shard*. A rock below here contains a *Resist Wing*, and there is a *Blue Shard* three tiles down and one tile left.

Head downstairs. The boxes directly left of the healing star contain a *Revive*. Grab the *Blue Shard*. Then cross the bridge to get a *Modest Mint*. The tile at the top above the metal tracks contains a *Fire Gem*. You can give a GourmetTreat to catch **Lunatone**. Activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 1 while you are here. We will activate 5 more for a quest later.

Heal and save, then head up. Pick up the *Code Materna Rift Notes* to learn about Rift Galvantula. Partner up with Ren or Venam!

!partner(["Ren",:TRAINER_REN,4])

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,1])

!boss("RIFTGALVANTULA", "Dimensional Field")

In this fight, Galvantula will switch to a more powerful form and start summoning Joltik after its first shield is broken. Since SOS Joltik spawns are "continuous", it will infinitely respawn at the end of any turn when it has been knocked out, so defeating Galvantula as fast as possible afterwards is the way to go. Take advantage of the Egg form's lower stats in order to set up momentum to make the rest of the fight easier!

You'll be taken back to East Gearen afterwards.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You think I can do it? (Neutral)
- Where do I go next? (Ren +2)

## Post-Galvantula Sidequests

Back in the city, a few optional things we can do now: first, talk to Zumi in the library to continue *PictoZumi*. She'll give you the *Advanced Pokedex* if you caught Dedenne. She'll also send you on the next mission to get Drifloon.

The Advanced Pokedex is pretty cool: it shows basically all the details you'd normally need to crawl Bulbapedia for, including even Egg Moves, evolution details, and more. Simply navigate to a page of a caught Pokemon, scroll all the way over, and navigate with A.

Next, head into the Help Center and talk to Ayuda. Now that we've gotten 10 Cells, we'll get a *Cell Imprint*! This item lets you set any IV to 31, which is neat. Our next milestone will be 15 Zygarde Cells.

Finally, if you go to the Chrisola Hotel, talk to the woman in the first room in the right hallway to give you **Shinx**!

## Amethyst Cave 2

Make your way all the way back to Route 2 and re-enter Amethyst Cave. You can make your way all the way down to where we fought Galvantula to get a hidden *Electric Gem* in the top left minecart's bottom right corner.

Back at the entrance, head up. Smash the rock and pick up the hidden *Red Shard* in the rail below. The wall behind a rock to the right has a hidden *Super Potion*, and the second minecart above contains a hidden *Mineral Ball* in the middle. The rail to the left of this minecart and one tile up contains a *Green Shard*. To the left, the wall down from the rock to smash is a *Zinc*, and the machine above here has a *Mineral Ball*. The wall to the left of the leftmost machine contains a *Reverse Candy*. 

Head left and exit to River's End. We can't do much here yet, but grab a hidden *Blue Shard* in the purple flower in the second column and a *Green Shard* in the pink flower in the third-from-right column.

Back in the cave, go right. 

!battle(["Edward",:TECH,0], "Crystal Cavern")

Talk to the hooded guy then get a hidden *Electric Gem* in the right rock, then proceed to the next room.

The wall immediately on the right contains a *Genius Wing*. Two tiles down and three left from the first rock smash is a hidden *Reverse Candy*. 

!battle(["Era",:LADY,0], "Crystal Cavern")

On the right side of the room, the top box contains an *X Attack*. Head through the southeast exit.

A box to the right contains a *Repel*. Down and to the right, the right side of a drill machine contains an *X Defend* and the last rock contains a *Rock Gem*. Go immediately to the left in the next room to get a *Mineral Ball* in the wall. Follow the path until you meet Nim!

In the altered dimension, solve her difficult puzzles and prepare for a battle.

!battle(["Nim",:APPRENTICE,0], "Psychic Terrain")

The Solrock and Lunatone can be frustrating with Rock Slide, but anything speedier can knock them out without much difficulty. Inkay won't be that much of a threat, so you can probably do well by letting it sit there while you beat up on the other side. Hidden Power is boosted in this field, so if you have it on your special attackers, especially those with type advantages, you'll be fine.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes (Nim +2)
- No (Nim -2)

She'll give you the *Room ID Card*! When you are back in the cave, the wall to the left of the bottom stairs contains a *Super Potion*, and the one above and right of the top stairs contains a *Reverse Candy*. Head into Sheridan Village to the north.

## Sheridan Village

Listen to a cutscene with Aelita and the Elder. At the moment it costs money to heal here, so we're gonna start by heading all the way north into Sheridan Arena via going the left path.

!battle(["Alexander",:BLACKBELT,0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Charles",:BLACKBELT,0], "Forest Field")

Knock on Keta's door at the very top, then enter the inn on the east side of the village. Head upstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I will. (Aelita +3)
- Why me?? (Aelita -1)

Now healing is free. Talk to the woman downstairs to sleep once, and we will explore Sheridan Village now.

Talk to a girl in the lobby of the inn to get a *Sweet Heart*. Talk to a girl in the first room on the left in the vertical hallway and take on the *Lost Boyfriend* quest.

!enc(423, ["Grass", "Fishing", "Rock Smash"], ["Old"])

Outside, go east. Above the boxes is a hidden *Ability Capsule*. A trainer is wandering around to the left.

!battle(["Jessibelle",:AROMALADY,0], "Forest Field")

Go down for another fight:

!battle(["Lilith",:CRUSHGIRL,0], "Forest Field")

Enter the Move Tutor House just above the entrance to the village, and talk to a girl. This opens a quest for way later.

Go left to enter the Sheridan General Shop.

!shop("Sheridan General", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Potion", "Super Potion", "Ice Heal", "Antidote", "GourmetTreat", "Super Repel", "Reverse Candy"])

Enter the shop on a weekday morning and you'll see Beth and her Miltank. Talk to her to get a free *Moomoo Milk* sample, then her shop will open. Berry Juice can be a pretty good hold item at this stage of the game! It is only open on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday Mornings.

!shop("Sheridan Village Drinks", ["Berry Juice"])

You can sneak around the back of the shop, if you do, talk to the shop owner from behind to get a *Super Potion*! A tile left and up from the backdoor on the outside is a hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Up from here:

**ZCell 011: Sheridan Village**

!img("zcell011.png")

You'll notice a guy here: this is Truck Guy. He will take us for free between Sheridan and Gearen, so take advantage of this instead of paying the train fee whenever possible.

North of here is an Audino breeder towards the top: every time you beat them, you will get *3 Exp. Candy S*. 

!battle(["Jody",:POKEBREEDER_F,0], "Forest Field")

Take your Jigglypuff and any other Pokemon in the Fairy egg group to the nearby daycare, and breed to get **Igglybuff**. Then, trade it with a girl in the inn to get a **Smoochum** holding a *Twisted Spoon*!

Talk to the truck guy and have him take you back to East Gearen City. In Jenner's lab, use the Room ID Card on the right room to get the *Exp. Share*! Read the note, then talk to Melia's wardrobe to get the *Audition Tape*. Plug it in to the computer to watch a lore cutscene if you want.

I will also mention that obtaining HM Cut isn't too far off, so buying the Golden Axe at the AP Shop as soon as you can will help us out in the future.

Return to Sheridan, then go to the Sheridan Arena at the top.

!enc(424, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

On the right:

!battle(["Natalia",:CRUSHGIRL,0], "Forest Field")

Head up and talk to the **Swablu** flying overhead for a battle. Return to Keta's house and talk to him in his garden.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I am. (Keta +2)
- But i just got here... (Keta -2)

After accepting Keta's quest, head south out of the village and go back all the way through Amethyst Cave. 

To continue the *Lost Boyfriend* quest, talk to the box of plants near the water in the second room, then head north. Go to the west side of the room, where you'll see the man getting assaulted by **Solrock**. Challenge it to a battle and catch it to proceed.

Continue through the cave. Once at the entrance, head west until you see a red rock. Touch the stone, and a door will open. Enter and go downstairs. On the left above a tree is a hidden *Moon Ball*.

!enc(488)

On the right side, two tiles right and three tiles above the lower rock smash is a hidden *Red Shard*. A rock smash above hides a *Heart Scale* in the left side of a red tree. On the left, above the stage thing, in the middle of a red tree is another hidden *Red Shard*.

Once you're ready, talk to the spirit of Keta. He will give you the *Soul Stone*. Then exit and watch the scene and fast travel back to Sheridan.

## Sheridan Help Quests

Returning to the inn in Sheridan to complete the *Lost Boyfriend* quest. You'll be given $8000 for saving the guy.

Now is a good time to do the Sheridan Village Help Quests. The help center is in the upper right part of the village.

### The Hidden Library 2

Start outside the help center and talk to the backpacker. Truck on over to Gearen, then go to the Chrisola Hotel and talk to Karen in front.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- The Hidden Library (+2 Karen)
- Looking for a BATHROOM (+1 BIGJRA... just kidding. Neutral)

Head to Dr. Jenkel's lab and watch the scene. Go to Gearen Park and talk to Karen. Enter the library.

!enc(418)

Head to the left, then go down and enter the door. Grab *TM19 Secret Power* here. Go up and right, then enter the room on the right. There are nine colorful books in this room - pick them all up, with the help of bookcase ladders to get up high. Once you do, put them in the bookshelf in the top right corner to battle and catch **Elgyem**!

In the previous room, go up and climb the bookshelf to get *TM63 Embargo*. In the top left:

**ZCell 012: Hidden Library**

!img("zcell012.png")

Go all the way around to the left. One tile above a page near the door at the top, you can get a hidden *Ether*. Enter the room here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Consolation prize for Karen getting a Mega Ring when you don't... (+2 Karen)

You do at least get the *Ancient Book* and can read some prophesies above.

Head back to Sheridan Village when you're done and talk to the backpacker.

You can choose to give him the book or not. If you do give it away, you'll get *Blue Moon Ice Cream*... but to buy another *Ancient Book*, you'll need to shell out $75,000 at the Kecleon Bazaar. Up to you.

Claim your reward: $950 and *Water Stone*! (+1 Karma)

### Stolen Cargo

Use the trucker to get to Gearen City, then go to Oceana Pier. Head to the southeast, then follow the guy into the warehouse.

If you try to go north, you'll get shocked, and your Pokemon will faint. The key here is to transform the Factory field into Short-Circuit via battling the Electrike trainer in the southwest and getting it to use Discharge.

!battle(["Usain",:CUEBALL,0], "Factory Field")

 Once you've done this, head through the middle arrows.

Venam will join you for a battle.

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,1])

!dbattle(["Samwell",:CUEBALL,0], ["Jacksin",:CUEBALL,0], "Factory Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Beat the Cue Balls with Venam (+1 Venam)

Before we leave the warehouse, interact with the panel to switch the direction of the middle tile, then head right. Grab *TM09 Venoshock* then head back to Sheridan.

Claim your reward: $950 and *5 GourmetTreats*. (+1 Karma)

### Trade Me!

First, grab one Aipom from your PC, or catch one on Route 2 if you haven't already. Then go to Sheridan Arena.

Talk to the girl with blue hair, then trade for **Pancham**.

Claim your reward: $1920 and *Rare Candy*! (+1 Karma)

### Get an Item

Start by heading through Amethyst Cave to Route 2, then enter the Kecleon Bazaar.

If you have $50,000 in your bag, you'll be offered the item for $20,000. you're welcome to pay for the golden item, but if not, you will have to steal it. If you have at least $20,000 you'll be given one more opportunity to buy it... but otherwise you'll get teleported to the THIEF'S DUNGEON!

After talking to the grunt and getting out, memorize the map on the wall. If you don't take the path outlined, you will get destroyed by the Kecleon...

!battle(["Kecleon",:MERCH,0])

So make SURE you memorize your unique path. Enter the door that corresponds to yellow to get an *Ice Stone*, *Dawn Stone*, or *Dusk Stone* depending on random chance.

Escape, and return to the help center. If you stole it instead of buying it, talk to the guy to get *Blue Moon Ice Cream*.

Claim your reward inside: $1890, Casteliacone! (+1 Karma)

### Battle Me Again!

Prepare your team and talk to Novae at the inn at night.

!dbattle(["Rorim B.",:DISCOTEEN,2], ["Novae",:WANDERER,1], "Forest Field")

This can be a tough one, but targeting Rorim first tends to make it easier.

After the battle, return to the help center. Your rewards: $1600, and **Clobbopus**. (+1 Karma).

## Karrina's Quest

Real quick there's another quest we can do, though it's not available from the Help Center. Take the truck back to Gearen and enter Karrina's hideout near the sewers. Talk to her, and she'll send us on the gang fight quest. Head to Route 2 and enter Amethyst Cave. Talk to Karrina in the top of the room.

!battle(["Charly",:CUEBALL,0], "Crystal Cavern")

Head up, and beat the guy at the end to get **Houndour**!

## Diamond Punch Badge

Return to Sheridan Arena when you're ready and talk to Aelita.

!battle(["Keta",:LEADER_KETA,0], "Forest Field")

!move("GALESTRIKE")

This battle is the first to really show you how well the trainers compensate for their type disadvantages here -- almost everything has a Dark or Rock type move. Scraggy is a good dud to leave out on one side of the field, especially if you can paralyze it, as it doesn't do enough damage to really be threatening at least compared to his other Pokemon. Combusken can be tough once it outspeeds you, but also has Protect so it might be smart to focus your attacks on the other Pokemon. Lucario is annoyingly bulky and can hit pretty hard, so focusing on taking it out may be advisable. A very tough fight, but you have lots of team options to make it more possible.

Sensei runs off, instead of paying up a badge! Follow Aelita into the waterfall cave.

## Carotos Mountain

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes. (Aelita +1)
- No. (Aelita -1)

You'll team up with Aelita here, so she'll heal you but catching wild Pokemon is a bit tougher.

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT,0])

!enc(119, nil, ["Old"])

Head up and grab *TM121 Fire Spin*. Smashing rocks to the right will lead you to a *Rare Candy* and hidden *Blast Powder*. Continue on the main path.

!battle(["SEC",:SECURITYSYSTEM,3], "Volcanic Field")

Catch its **Shadow Ponyta**! Head into the next room. Keta will partner with you!

!partner(["Keta",:LEADER_KETA,0])

Go left first.

!battle(["Donald",:XENANALYST_M,0])

!battle(["Melly",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

Step on the Red Switch then proceed to the next room.

!battle(["Maria",:XENANALYST_F,0])

!battle(["Sarah",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

Grab the *Revival Herb* in the next room, then step on the Red/Yellow Switch. Go down and into the room on the left, stand on the Blue/Green Switch, then exit and walk through the open gates to the room at the top.

!battle(["Demil",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

!battle(["Jensly",:XENANALYST_M,0])

Enter the room on the left and read the books.

!battle(["Forrest",:XENANALYST_M,0])

Step on the Yellow Switch then return to the previous room and go up.

!battle(["Aisel",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

Grab the *Hyper Potion* in the next room, then talk to the case beyond the green gate to get an *Up-Grade*! Step on the Green Switch beyond the blue gate then return to the previous room and go right.

!battle(["Alison",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

!battle(["Fern",:XENANALYST_M,0])

Grab the *Dusk Ball* in the bottom left, then step on the Blue/Green Switch. Return to the top left room, talk to the case on the left to get **Mime Jr.**, then step on the Green Switch. Return to the previous room, head up and grab the *Fresh Water*, then proceed.

!battle(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,0])

This one doesn't have to be won, though it is very doable. Essentially, Mewtwo will charge an attack for 10 turns - once it's charged, you lose. Turns where it cannot attack at all such as by Paralysis will delay this timer. Every turn until then will have Mewtwo using its intermediate attack, Shadow Beam, which hits both sides of the field but will always go last in a turn.

You have Keta on your side, so it's functionally a 12 on 6. Keta's Pokemon also tend to attack Mewtwo, so simply wailing on Mewtwo and ignoring Cufant is the move - it is pretty unlikely the Charge Attack will finish charging. Past that, a rock type can demolish half of her team, and Keta's fast fighting Pokemon will help you out. Two of them have fake out, so when you get to Mewtwo, try to take advantage of those turns to deal heavy damage to Mewtwo. Mewtwo also takes damage every time it attacks thanks to Fever Pitch, so take advantage of that and dish out as much damage as you can as soon as her other Pokemon are all wiped out.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Madelis in battle with Keta (+1 Madelis, +1 Karma)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Thanks, Aelita (+2 Aelita)
- I can handle myself. (-2 Aelita)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- He's trying. (+1 Aelita)
- He threw Sheridan away. (Neutral)
- He's a terrible person. (-4 Aelita)

Grab *TM43 Flame Charge* below, then open the door to the Generator Room above and head in.

!battle(["SEC",:SECURITYSYSTEM,4])

Unfortunately, without our snag machine, we can't catch this Quagsire nor future Shadow Pokemon until we fix it. Talk to the monitor next to you and transfer Volcanion to Carotos Mountain. Exit at the bottom and follow the path out to the main part of the Mountain, then go up.

Grab the *Code Statia Rift Notes* and head up.

We haven't had enough legendary battles with only one gym badge quite yet, so follow Aelita up and grab the *Rift Dex Info*.

After a brief scene, you'll be taken into a rift space. Talk to Volcanion and answer its question and the battle will begin!

!boss("RIFTVOLCANION", "Dimensional Field")

So, you'll probably be faster than this guy. Light Screen or SpD boosting will help you here. Hack away at its shields with some decent STAB moves.

Return to Madelis' Castle at the top, and use the warp to reach the back room.

Once you're free, head to the gate in Sheridan, and enter the spring.

!enc(206, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

Pick up the *Magical Seed* up from the entrance. Head up and talk to the pair. Answer "Are you ok?" to the Eldest for +1 Karma. Once you leave the shrine, Keta will ask you to fast travel to Amethyst Grotto. Accept this fast travel request. 

Head up to talk to Keta. You'll receive *TM103 Stacking Shot* as well as the Diamond Punch badge! Our level cap is now Lv. 30.

By talking to the butterfly at the top of the map, we can now fight Keta's spirit if we wish, but it's a bit too high leveled for our party right now. Make your way back to Sheridan!

It's worth noting that we now have access to the Purify Chamber in the PC! Shadow Pokemon in Rejuvenation have moves they can't normally get, for example Ponyta has Fell Stinger and Bonsly has Shift Gear. Stick them in the Purify Chamber to get them slowly purified.

If you head back through Amethyst Cave to Route 2 and enter the Kecleon Bazaar, if you've bought the Magnetic Lure already, you can buy the *Mirror Lure* for $2000, which makes it so you'll encounter the same Pokemon as your lead, helpful for shiny hunting.

One more thing we can do: head into the house in the bottom right of Sheridan. Gothitelle will battle us!

!boss("BOSSGOTHITELLE_SHERIDAN")

If you win, you'll be able to pick up **Gothita** behind!

Anyways, to finish the chapter's story, talk to Aelita in the upstairs of the inn and agree to sleep.
