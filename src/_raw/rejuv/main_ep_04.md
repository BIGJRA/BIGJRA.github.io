# Chapter 4: Isolation

Start in East Gearen for some sidequests. Talk to Shana in the Gearen Lab to continue the Johto quest. You'll now have to fight Bugsy with the starter you picked and a few more Pokemon.

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,1], "Virtual Trainer (Chikorita)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,11], "Virtual Trainer (Cyndaquil)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,21], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

!battle(["Bugsy",:JOHTO_2,0], "Glitch Field")

After this, you'll get another *Virtual Badge*! This will finish her leg of this quest.

To the left of the library, we can now cut down a tree to access a garden area. Grab a hidden *Blue Shard* in a gap between tall grass behind the library, a *Grass Gem* hiding in front of the lower dumpster, an *Escape Rope* hidden in the top wall of the building, and a hidden *Synthetic Seed* in the top right flower patch amongst the tall grass tiles.

The Poke Ball shop in Gearen has two new balls now:

!shop("Poke Ball Boutique (1 Badge)", ["Heavy Ball", "Moon Ball", "Love Ball", "Fast Ball", "Nest Ball", "Net Ball"])

There's also a few new berries now.

!shop("Berry Emporium (3 Badges)", ["Oran Berry", "Pecha Berry", "Rawst Berry", "Chesto Berry", "Aspear Berry"])

There are a few areas we can now access with Cut. Take the train to Route 2. North of the camper at night, you can find:

**ZCell 013: Route 2**

!img("zcell013.png")

Cut the tree to the right, then go up the path. Three tiles below the left tile of the tree at the top of this landing is a hidden *Blue Shard*.

Enter Amethyst Cave, and make your way to the top left of the entrance room. Exit to River's End, then cut the tree and head inside.

!enc(433)

Next, go to Sheridan Village and cut the tree next to the shop below to pick up *TM54 False Swipe*, and:

**ZCell 014: Sheridan Village**

!img("zcell014.png")

This can be extremely helpful for catching Pokemon going forward. We can also get more drinks!

!shop("Sheridan Village Drinks (3 Badges)", ["Berry Juice", "Lemonade", "Moomoo Milk"])

On the south side of the village, you'll see a Sawk and Throh. Talk to the woman here. 

!battle(["Janelle",:CRUSHGIRL,0], "Forest Field")

You'll have a chance to catch **Throh**! Inside the daycare, a trainer will offer you a **Sawk** for your Throh. If you give it away now, you'll lose your only Throh, so up to you on whether or not it is worth doing before getting a Ditto to breed it.

Next, take the train onto Route 1 from East Gearen. We can't reenter Goldenwood Forest yet, but we can go left with Cut.

!battle(["Emile",:CUEBALL,0], "Forest Field")

Notably, you can talk to **Teddiursa** here to catch it.

!battle(["Kairi",:OPT,0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Karin",:TOURIST,0], "Forest Field")

In this back area, you have to carefully sneak around such as to not be detected by Exploud. If you fail, all of the **Loudred** will swarm you, but at least you can catch them. You'll also be attacked by the Lv. 50 Prism Exploud, who cannot be caught.

Grab the *Jolly Mint*, *TM122 Screech*, *TM78 Bulldoze*, and:

**ZCell 015: Route 1**

!img("zcell015.png")

With 15 Zygarde cells obtained, we can return to Ayuda in the East Gearen Help Center to get another Cell Imprint. Our next threshold is 25xx.

Head next into the nearby Magnolia Library. Talk to the blue haired girl here to get relationship points... a few chapters later. Pay the entrance fee then enter the room on the left. Talk to the girl in here to do a quiz. If you answer all the questions correctly, you'll get a *Thunderstone*! The answers are brown, Goldenwood, and Goldenleaf.

Finally, go to Luck's Tent in the Gearen Park. There is a new Marshadow in the bottom left corner:

!tutor("Margo Move Tutor", [["Recycle", "2 Yellow Shards"], ["Worry Seed", "2 Green Shards"], ["Snore", "2 Red Shards"], ["Shock Wave", "2 Blue Shards"], ["Water Pulse", "2 Red Shards"], ["Snatch", "2 Blue Shards"], ["Wonder Room", "2 Green Shards"], ["Magic Room", "2 Yellow Shards"], ["Role Play", "2 Yellow Shards"]])

## Route 3

As soon as you're ready, head to Route 3, west from Sheridan.

!shop("Route 3 Gate", ["Poke Ball", "Potion", "Repel"])

!enc(69, ["Grass"], nil, "Route 3 (North)")

!enc(69, ["Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 3 / Mirage Woods / Phasial Cave / Goldenleaf Town")

The top tile to the right of the river contains a *Honey*, and to the left of the RV is a *Quiet Mint*.

**ZCell 016: Route 3**

!img("zcell016.png")

Talk to the guy in the trailer across the bridge. Since we have two virtual badges, he'll offer the third leg of the quest -- we're battling Whitney.

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,2], "Virtual Trainer (Chikorita)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,12], "Virtual Trainer (Cyndaquil)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,22], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

!battle(["Whitney",:JOHTO_3,0], "Glitch Field")

After winning, you'll get the third *Virtual Badge*. That's not all though: he'll immediately offer you the next challenge, this time against Morty.

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,3], "Virtual Trainer (Chikorita)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,13], "Virtual Trainer (Cyndaquil)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,23], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

!battle(["Morty",:JOHTO_4,0], "Glitch Field")

For winning, you'll get your fourth *Virtual Badge*. The girl here is the **Move Deleter**, should you need to remove any moves. Exit the RV.

We will enter the Mirage Woods at the top later on. Head down the stairs on the left. You can interact with **Surskit** dancing on the pond surface for a battle!

The leftmost cut tree hides a *Sitrus Berry* beyond. Three tiles down from the cave entrance is a hidden *Yellow Shard*. We'll explore this cave later; for now, head down the right set of stairs.

!battle(["Lizzie",:PICNICKER,0])

!battle(["Marissa",:OPT,0])

Enter the market area. All the events and shops here can only be accessed during daytime. Talk to Aelita during the day.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm starving... (Aelita +2)
- No distractions! (Neutral)

If you go with the first option, you'll get *Vanilla Ice Cream*, *Chocolate Ice Cream*, or *Berry Ice Cream*.

!shop("Route 3 Ice Cream", ["Vanilla Ice Cream", "Choc Ice Cream", "Berry Ice Cream"])

She'll also rarely have *Blue Moon Ice Cream* to sell. Ideally, we want to get a few of each of the Ice Creams for a side quest later.

!shop("Route 3 Goods", ["Reverse Candy", "Sachet", "Soda Pop", "Sweet Heart", ["Red Nectar", 550], "Whipped Dream"])

We'll eventually need Sachet and Whipped Dream to evolve Swirlix and Spritzee from earlier. We're also eventually going to want 10 Sweet Hearts for a quest, so go ahead and get those.

The flower above the Ice Cream vendor contains a hidden *Green Shard*. Down and to the left is *TM117 Pay Day*! Hidden behind it is a *Star Piece*.

**ZCell 017: Route 3**

!img("zcell017.png")

Head down from the shops. 

!battle(["Elizabeth",:COOLTRAINER_F,0])

A kid here laments not getting a Phantump egg, so we'll later want to find one and trade it to him. Talk to Amanda, then head down.

Just before the grass turns lighter, in the right gap in the tall grass, there is a hidden *Sassy Mint*. Follow the path around to the right. Heading back into the darker grass, two tiles up from the lighter grass on the left is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Head up. Behind in the left tile of the tree below the RV is a hidden *Rare Candy*. Enter the open RV and talk to the hiker for some *Rose Tea*.

**ZCell 018: Route 3**

!img("zcell018.png")

Proceed to the south, till the grass changes color twice.

!enc(71, ["Grass"], nil, "Route 3 (South)")

Head down till the grass changes color twice. In the tall grass all the way right is a hidden *Super Repel*. Down from here the grass will change again, the grass patch four right and two down from the gray-haired girl contains a *Red Shard*. Up the stairs to the left of the waterfall is a *Mystic Water*!

!battle(["Nate and Delilah",:COOLCOUPLE1,0], "Forest Field")

Down from the stairs, the last red flower before the color changes again hides a *Super Potion*. Crossing the bridge here, two tiles down from the left of a pair of two tall grass tiles hides a *Honey*.

Attempt to enter Goldenleaf Town to the south. Then, interact with the tent near the campfire to the north.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- A Gym Battle! (Ren +1)
- Wanna see the sights~ (Ren +1)
- No reason... (Ren -2)

When you're ready talk to Aelita for a battle.

!battle(["Aelita",:STUDENT,2], "Forest Field")

This isn't going to be that tough of a battle - her team is mostly not fully evolved and doesn't yet take advantage of the full power STAB moves. Hawlucha can be dangerous if it gets off a couple Hone Claws, so make sure your best Pokemon to take it out isn't surprised by Flying Gem boosted Bounce. Electric, Psychic, and Flying types will overall succeed here if you're stuck.

## Mirage Woods

Before continuing the story, we're going to explore a side area. We're gonna need a Pokemon with Flash. If you don't have the TM yet, it's at the Game Corner in East Gearen... or even better, buy the Golden Lantern with AP! Head back to the top of Route 3 and enter the clearing on the left.

!enc(149, ["Grass"])

The gimmick of this area is that some trees and other items are actually mirages, and can be walked through. A tree towards the top of this initial area is one such mirage, so walk up through it. Grab the hidden *Bug Gem* in a rock. Go left to reveal another mirage tree, and head down at the fork. Two tiles left and one tile up from a bush hides a hidden *Hyper Potion*, and the bush at the end hides an *Exp. Candy L*. Back at the fork, go up through the tent.

!battle(["Tommy",:CAMPER,0], "Forest Field")

Go left. Two tiles above the rightmost tall grass is a hidden *Pretty Wing*. Hidden in the middle of a yellower-than-its-neighbors tree down and right from here is a *Moomoo Milk*. The TM to the left is a mirage... but beyond it is a mirage cave, in which there is a hidden *Magical Seed* at the bottom and *TM48 Round*!

Back outside, to the right,you'll see a lone bush - go right from it then up to reveal a mirage path through the rock face! Hug the left wall as you go up to reveal yet another mirage path through some trees. One tile right and three down from the hiker is a hidden *Ether*. Talk to said hiker to begin the *Broken Bell* quest.

Back on the rock face, go right. Grab the *Ultra Ball*, then go down.

!battle(["Fennel",:AROMALADY,0], "Forest Field")

An empty spot between trees on the right contains a hidden *Exp. Candy M*. Go left then up, in a flower patch on the ground is a hidden *Poison Gem*. Another flower patch down and left hides a *Super Repel*. Go right, down, and right through more mirage trees. Down and left is another flower patch hidden item: a *Rawst Berry*.

The bridge to the right is a lie! Instead, cut the tree below and go through the mirage tree. Down and to the left, above the bottom flower patch, is a hidden *Steam Ball*. You can exit the Woods through a one-way mirage tree to the left.

Cross the real bridge to the right and go up. In the grass tile surrounded by dirt is a hidden *X Defend*. A flower patch above contains a hidden *Reverse Candy*. Head up into the Mirage Town area.

In the right house, grab the *Steam Ball* and talk to the scientist to begin the *Cranky Crobat* quest. Outside, enter the house on the upper right hill to get the *Itemfinder*! Finally we have the Itemfinder. This means that I don't have to describe the location of every hidden item in excruciating detail, moving forward. Speaking of which, around the Mirage Town area, there is a hidden *Clever Wing* and *Genius Wing*. Cut the tree at the top, go up the mirage stairs, grab the hidden *Reverse Candy*, and proceed into the cave at the top.

Grab *TM66 Payback* as well as hidden *Everstone*, *2 Exp. Candy L*, *Repel*, *Nugget*, *Red Shard*, *Yellow Shard*, *Rock Gem*, and *Awakening* as you proceed through the cave. Use Flash at the bottom for a battle!

!boss("BOSSCROBAT", "Cave Field")

This is a very tough boss fight. It uses Acrobatics during its first two shields and gets a Sitrus Berry and shifts to Brave Bird for its last two shields. It outspeeds especially with Tailwind while its Zubat and Woobat lackeys love to lay on the confusion. The key here is high defenses paired with resistances, ideally Steel and field-boosted Rock types, and some way to deal with constant Confusion spam.

After you win, you'll get **Zubat**. Talk to the scientist that gave us the quest to close out *Cranky Crobat*.

Outside, cross under the waterfall to the left. A *Carbos* is in the first house. Talk to the old woman in the left house - she'll tell us that the *Broken Bell* is missing a piece that may be found in Phasial Cave. Outside, go down and left to take some mirage stairs to get a hidden *Rare Candy*. Exit the Mirage Woods.

## Phasial Cave

One more optional area to explore. Head up to the top of Route 3 and go to the left and into Phasial Cave.

!enc(97, ["Cave"])

Use your itemfinder to get a hidden *Rock Gem* and *Magical Seed*. Pick up the *Ability Capsule* on the ground down to the left. Head up, right, and down.

!battle(["Betina",:LASS,0], "Cave Field")

Go right from here. Hidden is a *Steel Gem*. Continuing right on this path would lead us to an exit to Route 3, but we don't need to exit at this time.

Left of here, there is another pond. Get a hidden *Reverse Candy* up and right.

**ZCell 019: Phasial Cave**

!img("zcell019.png")

Head to the left when you can: going left and up you'll find a hidden *Mineral Ball*.

**ZCell 020: Phasial Cave**

!img("zcell020.png")

Go down and right from here:

**ZCell 021: Phasial Cave**

!img("zcell021.png")

Go right and up from here. Get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Blue Shard*. You'll see a shiny spot in this area - talk to it to get the *Bell Machine* for the *Broken Bell* quest. Then go down.

!battle(["Billium",:HIKER,0], "Cave Field")

Hug this wall on the right to get a hidden *Sun Stone* and *Red Shard*. Head up the ladder here, the rock on the right contains a *Grass Gem*. Exit to the south!

Now that we have the bell part, return to Mirage Woods and talk to the old woman. She'll repair the bell: ring it and the hiker will come to it. Backtrack in the woods to his RV by going left on the large rock face... of course, it's a mirage RV, so grab the *Telluric Seed* and enter the cave.

!battle(["???",:HIKER,0], "Cave Field")

Talk to **Zorua** to get it and wrap up *Broken Bell*! Also in this cave are *Blackglasses*, and a hidden *Yellow Shard*, *Moomoo Milk*, and *2 Exp. Candy M*.

## Goldenleaf Town

Enter Goldenleaf Town at the bottom of Route 3!

!battle(["Sariah",:GHOSTGIRL,6], "Forest Field")

!enc(82, ["Grass"])

Don't forget to catch a Drifloon. Grab a hidden *Honey* to the left. Talk to the garden's guardian at the bottom of town.

!battle(["Pietro",:GHOSTGUY,0], "Forest Field")

Grab the hidden *Moon Stone* and *Rare Candy* beyond. Pick up the *Rash Mint* too. At night only:

**ZCell 022: Goldenleaf Town**

!img("zcell022.png")

Head left and grab hidden *Ghost Gem* and *Dark Gem*. Near the Pokemon Center is a hidden *Red Shard*.

!battle(["Julie",:PICNICKER,0], "Forest Field")

There's a hidden *Ability Capsule* and *Super Potion* to the left. Cut a tree below to get a hidden *Big Mushroom*. Talk to Mr. Luck above to get the *Ancient Teachings*... an item that evolves your Dartrix/Quilava/Dewott into Hisuian Decidueye/Typhlosion/Samurott! Up the hill is a hidden *Rawst Berry*.

Cross the bridge on the left side of town. Grab *TM59 Incinerate* and the hidden *Chesto Berry*, plus:

**ZCell 023: Goldenleaf Town**

!img("zcell023.png")

We'll also find a purple wisp here. Start collecting these as well.

**Wisp 01: Goldenleaf Town**

!img("wisp01.png")

Enter Ren's house to the east of the Giratina statue. In his room upstairs:

**Wisp 02: Goldenleaf Town**

!img("wisp02.png")

In Reina's room, read Reina's diary then check the couch for $500.

!shop("Goldenleaf Mart", ["Great Ball", "Super Potion", "GourmetTreat", "Repel", "Super Repel", "Escape Rope"])

Talk to Narcissa by her gym, then follow her up the hill to her house. After a scene,you'll be free to leave. Head back out to the balcony at night to grab this first, at night only:

**ZCell 024: Goldenleaf Town**

!img("zcell024.png")

Outside, cut the tree next to the gym and enter the secret cave behind the waterfall!

!enc(489)

**Wisp 03: Wispy Ruins**

!img("wisp03.png")

Exit the ruins. Enter the Forgotten Path to the northeast. 

!enc(91, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

Grab the hidden *Green Shard* and *Super Potion*. Grab *TM39 Rock Tomb* and a hidden *Blue Shard* by cutting the tree and climbing the vines, plus:

**Wisp 04: Forgotten Path**

!img("wisp04.png")

Back in the middle path:

**ZCell 025: Forgotten Path**

!img("zcell025.png")

Grab the hidden *Ether*, *Burn Heal*, *Great Ball*, and *Ghost Gem*. This is all we can do here for now, so head back to Goldenleaf Town.

Talk to the trucker to head back to Gearen City - we're going to make a pitstop with Zumi at the Magnolia Library. For catching Drifloon, she'll give us 3 *Exp. Candy M*. She doesn't have our next objective yet, so we'll have to return later.

Head into the Help Center nearby, and talk to Ayuda in the back. For collecting 25 Zygarde Cells, we'll get another *Cell Imprint*. Our next goal is 35.

## Wispy Path

Head west from Goldenleaf Town to reach Wispy Path.

!enc(95, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

!battle(["Anna",:GHOSTGIRL,0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Michelle",:COOLTRAINER_F,0], "Forest Field")

At the fork, go down and left. Head into Wispy Park up the stairs. Grab the *Reverse Candy* as well as hidden *Tiny Mushroom* and *Lemonade*.

**ZCell 026: Wispy Path**

!img("zcell026.png")

**Wisp 05: Wispy Path**

!img("wisp05.png")

Talk to the guy up here, then to **Espurr**. It will let you do a variety of fun things with it; each increases your friendship with it. Choosing to give it ice cream, especially Blue Moon Ice Cream, raises it by a lot. Once you've gotten its friendship high enough and try to leave it will join your party. (+1 Karma)

Head down the stairs and around to the right. Grab a hidden *Ghost Gem*. 

!battle(["Lanya",:CHANELLER,0], "Forest Field")

There is a hidden *Careful Mint*, *Rawst Berry*, *Green Shard*, *Ability Capsule*, and a *Hyper Potion* going left and down.

## Goldenwood Forest 2

This next section is optional. Head into the gatehouse on the left side and you'll be recruited by "C" to take care of the Dimensional Rift, but only after a 3v3 battle with his three bug types.

!battle(["C",:LEADER_CRAWLI2,0])

Orbeetle can be annoying if it puts you to sleep, so have a way to account for that. Ariados isn't hard to take down but make sure you don't let Galvantula sweep after a Charge Beam or two. Fire types will do well here!

!enc(321, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Goldenwood Forest (Overgrown)")

First thing we're going to do is head into Goldenwood Cave. We couldn't get here with Rock Smash before, but now that we can, go ahead and pick up the *Rare Candy*, *Nugget*, and hidden *Blue Shard*. Your Pokemon should be able to now beat the Leavanny trainer, if you haven't yet.

Outside the cave, go left. There's a hidden *Ether* if you climb some stairs. Down from here is a hidden *Nest Ball*. A hidden *GourmetTreat* is to the left, plus:

**ZCell 027: Goldenwood Forest**

!img("zcell027.png")

Down from here is a hidden *Sitrus Berry*. Back up towards the top of the map, go down the right side and grab the hidden *Chesto Berry*. Down the stairs, grab the hidden *Reverse Candy*, *Great Ball*, and *PP Up*. Below you'll find a *Guard Spec* and a hidden *Oran Berry*. To the left and up from here, a tile above the leftmost red mushrooms before the stairs contains a *Persim Berry*. Go up the first stairs then left. Two tiles right of the leftmost red flower is a *Sitrus Berry*. Pick up the *Guard Spec*. below.

Head up... 

!boss("RIFTGYARADOS2", "Forest Field")

This can be a tough fight thanks to three shields, three typings, and three very different field effects. Status effects like Paralysis remain key here, and a well rounded team of six should be able to deal with its various strategies and take it out.

Take it out, and C will thank us, giving us an Egg (+1 Karma)! This is a mystery egg that will hatch into one of **Sizzlipede**, **Blipbug**, or **Joltik**, randomly determined. Grab the nearby hidden *Persim Berry*.

## Wispy Tower

Return to Wispy Path, then enter the Wispy Tower area from the top of Wispy Path. Grab the hidden *Bold Mint*. Head in to the Tower.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I accept! (Aelita +2, Narcissa +4)
- I dunno... (Aelita -1, Narcissa -2)

Once that's done, head back into the Goldenwood Pokemon Center and talk to Aelita.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It was nothing.. (Ren +2, Aelita +2)
- Kinda uncomfortable. (Ren +1, Aelita +1)
- Uhh what's happening? (Neutral)

After a scene you'll be taken into a battle. 

!battle(["Sariah",:GHOSTGIRL,0])

Head upstairs to talk to Aelita and sleep, then exit. There are three Xen grunts downstairs disguised as Ghost types!

!battle(["Helain",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

!battle(["Selina",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

!battle(["Gutsy",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

Upstairs, head into the room at the top.

!battle(["Sariah",:GHOSTGIRL,1])

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- How'd you know? (Neutral)
- I want to go home. (Mosely -2)
- Time to whoop ass! (Neutral)

We're going back to Wispy Tower. Head to the top of the room:

**Wisp 06: Wispy Tower**

!img("wisp06.png")

Go down the stairs in the statue. After talking to Geara, Mosely and Narcissa will join you.

!enc(403)

!battle(["Malik",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

!battle(["Sheila",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

!battle(["Danni",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Enter the left room to get a *Revive*. Enter the next room. 

!battle(["Loriel",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Get the password `UNBOUND` via a computer at the top. Enter it on the right side of the starting area, then enter the next room. 

!battle(["George",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Get the next password: `SOUL`. To the right is an *Ether*, then enter the password and continue. Talk to the screen in here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Gregory? (Neutral)
- Sirius hid this. (Neutral)
- You seriously didnt know? (Mosely -2, Narcissa -2)

Back in the main room, head up for a battle.

!battle(["Eli and Sharon",:MISFORTUNATEDUO,5], "Short-Circuit Field")

It's been a while since we've had to fight this pair, but it's luckily not too much worse this time. Their main strategy here relies on moves that slow down your Pokemon, by stat-lower and paralysis. Tangela and Lickitung are slightly bulky, so bring out your own bulky party members to bring them down and save your faster Pokemon for Honchkrow and Mismagius and you'll likely be alright.

After the fight, make sure you heal, then return and go downstairs and through the door. Go up and you'll fight Geara!

!boss("WISPYGIRATINA", "Short-Circuit Field")

This is a tough fight. You're gonna need to break the barriers, but luckily your own Ghost and Dark moves are boosted by the field. Burning or paralyzing it and lowering its special attack may be the key to victory since it is fast and strong. You can also whittle its HP down by burning/poisoning/leech seeding it and anticipating what move it will use and switching to a Normal/Ground/Fairy type.

!battle(["Geara",:XENEXECUTIVE_3,1], "Short-Circuit Field")

This is a well put together doubles team. Persian will probably hit first and Marowak will probably hit last and probably knock one of your mons out, so plan your turn 1 attacks accordingly. Morgrem and Clefairy are very effective at stalling, but you can try to time knocking them out so that the screens run out. Haunter and Masquerain hit hard but if you have set up any of your Pokemon you may be able to succeed!

When you're back in town, you can proceed to the gym immediately, or go tackle a side area real fast.

## Phantasm Badge

After you've left Narcissa's house, talk to the Audino breeder next to the Pokemon Center for a repeatable battle against 3 Audino. Each time you win, you'll get *5* *Exp. Candy S*.

!battle(["Lina",:POKEBREEDER_F,0], "Forest Field")

Enter the theater.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- This will work. (Ren +2)
- I'm unsure... (Ren +1)
- It's a stupid idea. (Ren -2)

After learning of your challenge, enter the door on the left.

!enc(401)

Enter the door on the left, then talk to Mimikyu and read the sign. As the NPC says outside, follow the lit torches through the dungeon.

!battle(["Margaret",:CHANELLER,0], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Marissa",:GHOSTGIRL,0], "Haunted Field")

Although it may feel like you're going in circles, just keep following the torches until you finally pass through a mirror and get to the heal and PC stars. Head through the door.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Go ahead, Ren. (Ren +4)
- No. (Ren -4)

!battle(["Ren",:TRAINER_REN,1], "Haunted Field")

Flash and Dazzling Gleam temporarily nullify the field if you don't want to be overwhelmed by his Ghost and Dark moves, but otherwise he doesn't have too much power.Once you're done with Ren, say no to his question for maximum relationship points, then head up and get ready to face Narcissa.

In the auditorium, head down and grab the items: *Super Potion*, *Rawst Berry*, and *Rare Candy*. When you're ready, take on Narcissa.

!battle(["Narcissa",:LEADER_NARCISSA,0], "Haunted Field atop Forest Field")

!move("SPECTRALSCREAM")

Narcissa's team is mostly defense-oriented in part thanks to her signature move, though she has some heavy hitters as well. Her Mismagius is fast and benefits from field-boosted moves, so you likely must find a way to live a hit or two from it. The best way to overcome Narcissa is to use the field to your advantage: super-effective Ghost moves are a good choice. Flame Charge is a great choice to sweep with as it is boosted by the field and given Ghost sub-typing. Alternatively, if you have Flash or Dazzling Gleam, it'll remove the field for two turns. Just be aware she can turn it back by using Spectral Scream.

Once you're done, you'll get the Phantasm Badge and *TM30 Shadow Ball*! The Level Cap is now 40!

Head into Wispy Ruins.
