# .Karma Files (Paragon)

## Lake Spirits Quest

On Paragon route only, there is one more set of Legendaries we can go fetch: the Lake Spirits have appeared in their respective dens! We're going to go grab them. Make sure you have a GourmetTreat for each.

Fly to East Gearen and go to Goldenwood Park. Surf up at the very top of the hill to reach the Den of Verity to catch **Mesprit**!

Fly to Teila Resort and enter Aquamarine Cave. Down one floor you can dive on the large lake to reach the Den of Acuity. Catch **Uxie**!

Finally, fly over to Yui's Ranch and take a Braviary to Honec Woods. Exit Honec Woods to the west to reach the area with the Azelf Statue. Walk towards the shining star to reach the Den of Valor (not to be confused with Valor Mountain, of course) and catch **Azelf**!

**ZCell 142: Den of Valor**

## Xenogene Splicer's Revenge Quest

There is one more major quest that we can do only on the Paragon Route.

Time for a big one! Enter Rhodea's Penthouse in Grand Dream City. There is a flier on the table about something going on at Pokestar Studios! Read this flier then head over there by exiting the complex and walking left. Head in to the theater on the right and follow Mr. Dyre Rektor...

Watch the film he shows, then head west outside to his office building and talk to him in the rightmost room. Accept the fast travel home and talk to the briefcase to get started. Return to the studio again and agree to start with Aelita in the lobby. Inside, you'll get the jist of how this sidequest goes: talk to your co-actors, direct from the chair, etc. Make sure you talk to all the co-actors and crew as well as attempt to enter the bathroom between every shoot to get maximal rewards. Talk to the chair to begin filming the first part of the movie!

### Recording Session 1

Take some time to explore this part of the Movie World. Based on what I've read online, this quest is actually based on concepts from Zumi's scrapped game Pokemon Xenogene. It is cool to see at least part of the region and many of its characters realized in this sidequest in Rejuvenation!

Anyways, enter the building at the top of the area. Head downstairs at the top to "pick" a starter: it has to be Shinx, at the bottom.

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,0])

!battle(["Wynn",:XG_WYNN,0])

!battle(["Adelinde",:XG_ADELINDE,0])

### Recording Session 2

Once you return to the studio, talk to the characters around the building, then sit back in the Director's chair.

Explore the area a bit if you wish - none of the exploration is required and your movie-Pokemon don't gain Exp. You can battle some trainers here.

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,1])

!battle(["Theano",:SCIENTIST,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Silvester",:CAMPER,0], "City Field")

This trainer gives you a *Awakening*.

!battle(["Brian",:WORKERM,0], "City Field")

This trainer gives you a *Potion*. You can also find two *Super Potions*, two *Potions*, and a *Full Heal* around the city. A person in the center gives you two *Oran Berries*.

!battle(["Eugeneia",:POKEMONRANGER_M,0], "City Field")

This trainer gives you a *Revive*.

To progress the film, enter the Gym. Talk to the person at the top of the room, then to the woman at the desk below. Talk to the gym leader for a battle!

!battle(["Enya",:XG_ENYA,0])

You'll be taken to the Garbage Dump. Fun fact: the theme that played in the Nightmare School was originally created to be played in this area in the Xenogene game.

!partner(["Wynn",:XG_WYNN,1])

There is an *Antidote* in the bottom corner.

!battle(["Viviana",:FAIRYGIRL,0], "Wasteland Field")

This trainer gives you a *Pecha Berry*. Head right to learn we need to find some tools. A rusty blue shovel is above, and a heavy black box is below. You can use the blue shovel to the left on some blue boxes.

!battle(["Trash & Vermin",:POKEGANG9,0], "Wasteland Field")

You will get a purple shovel. Use it at the top left corner of the area to reach a *Potion* and another pile of trash, where we can use the black box from earlier to progress.

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,2])

!battle(["Vidas",:TOURIST,0], "Wasteland Field")

Pick up the heavy box towards the bottom and use it above at the ramp. In the top left corner is a red shovel, which you can use on two sets of boxes below. From here, go to the bottom right corner to use it a third time.

!battle(["Kyz",:ROCKER,0], "Wasteland Field")

You'll get a *Revive* from him and find a *Super Potion* above. Pick up the golden shovel. You can use the golden shovel in the top left to get a *Max Revive*, then use it on the right side of the area to proceed.

!boss("BOSSRATICATE", "Wasteland Field")

You can count on Wynn using Rock Blast while being sensible with your own team to win this fight.

While you're back in the studio, talk to the Director's chair one more time to see a scene outside. Back inside, if you've been talking to the cast throughout the quest, talk to Kai to get a *Thank-You Card*.

### Recording Session 3

Using the same team we had previously, time for a fight!

!battle(["Lucile",:XG_LUCILE,0])

This battle can actually be pretty tough for this team. I recommend using Toxic Spikes and stalling as much as possible by keeping Sandyghast alive with Mega Drain and using Detect on Meditite. Your character will win the Voltaic Badge!

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,2])

!partner(["Adelinde",:XG_ADELINDE,1])

Head left.

!battle(["Lyra",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

Enter this room.

!battle(["Liam",:XG_GRUNTM,0])

A *Revive* is to the right.

!battle(["Ophelia",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

Deactivate this terminal. Back in the central room, go right.

!battle(["Elias",:XG_GRUNTM,0])

Enter this room.

!dbattle(["Matthew",:XG_GRUNTM,0], ["Lucida",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

!battle(["Andrea",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

!battle(["Lucas",:XG_GRUNTM,0])

Deactivate both terminals. Back in the central room, go up.

!battle(["Helena",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

Head down the elevator to begin a stealth section. Grab the *Super Potion* and *Revive* and deactivate all six terminals as you proceed.

!battle(["Sierra",:XG_SIERRA,0])

### Red Carpet Premiere

Talk to Kai once you are ready to watch the premiere of the film! That completes this quest officially, but there are still a bunch of rewards to grab.

First, reenter the studio and try to enter the bathroom. You will get the *Blunder Policy*! Next, head into the dressing room if you got the Thank-You Note to receive a new outfit! Finally, talk to Dyre to get $25000!

Head over to the graveyard in the District of Hope. You'll see Zumi here and receive *5 Max Revives*, plus the *A. Ampharos Crest* if you got the Thank-You Note.

Head to the Gearen Lab and enter the Developer Area. Downstairs, Zumi will give you a challenge to beat three Xenogene trainers with your team.

!battle(["Adelinde",:XG_ADELINDE,2], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Enya",:XG_ENYA,1], "Icy Field")

!battle(["Wynn",:XG_WYNN,2], "Colosseum Field")

For defeating all three, you will get the *Rillaboomite*, *Cinderacite*, and *Inteleonite*! 



## Continuing .Karma Files (Paragon)

Once you're back at the Obelisk, reenter. Grant Melia access. You'll awaken in Zeight on the 8th. Make your way back to Sashila and talk to Erin to accept travel to Mika's Coffee.

!shop("Somniam Mall Pokeballs", ["Moon Ball", "Heavy Ball", "Friend Ball", "Love Ball", "Level Ball", "Fast Ball", "Lure Ball"])

Sadly, nine stamps is the maximum we can get in V13.5. Someday we'll be able to enter Goocci. Someday.

!battle(["Haggie",:CHANELLER,0], "City Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Me too... (+2 Ren)

- We should take the Zinc (-2 Ren)

Next, talk to the mailbox above the Pokemon Center in the Judicial District.

Finally, head up to the 100th floor of the Central Building. You can insert all of the beads we've collected so far to proceed. We get to fight a gym leader!

!battle(["Talon",:LEADER_TALON,0], "Sky Field")

Wait wait wait. Another Strong Winds fight on the Sky Field? You have to be kidding me. Frankly this one is a lot less miserable than Souta was though. Win against Talon to finish this section!

You'll be returned to Rhodea's Penthouse.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If Venam Points >= 10, say "I haven't noticed." (+3 Venam)
- Say "Yeah I have..." (Neutral)

Talk to Lavender to continue.

### .Karma File: Venam

After a chat in Tesla's kitchen, talk to Amber in her room.

Upstairs, we will be having a 6v6 tag battle!

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,7])

!dbattle(["Amber",:LEADER_AMBER,2], ["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM3,4], "Volcanic Top Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- They're just coping. (+2 Aelita)
- Sore losers, both of em... (Neutral)

Attempt to head outside and you will talk to Crawli, then fly over to Jynnobi pass and head up to Route 6. Enter the first battleship, then go down the ladder when prompted.

!battle(["Officia",:XENANALYST_F,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Press a switch at the top - this will let you jump over some boxes to go down and right.

!battle(["Voluptate",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Jump across at the bottom right to press another button. This will allow you to hop to the center-bottom area and press another button. Hop over to the bottom left corner and push the final button.

!battle(["Praesent",:XENMAGE_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're right... (+2 Venam)
- Hm... (Neutral)
- I'm not so sure... (+2 Aelita)

Back on Route 6, surf to the bottom and talk to Crawli.

Enter the living room in Tesla's Villa to finish up our Terajuma vacation.

### .Karma File: Alice & Allen

Talk to Erin. At Fort Rystrine, find her and Kanon to the right.

When you are yourself again, prepare for a gauntlet?? You don't have to win any of these fights right now, but we will need to complete the gauntlet eventually. I will cover completing this gauntlet later on when it is necessary... though if you get it out of the way now, great for you!

Follow Kanon to Fort Rystrine. Once you have control again, follow Crescent to the very tip of Zorrialyn Coast.

After a conversation in Oblitus Town, you will be given the chance to activate Interceptor's Wish (though, with no battles, this doesn't do anything).

As Melia, talk to Erin. After Lavender's Alakazam does its thing, interact with the blob at the very top.

As yourself again, reenter Zeight. You'll again be asked to activate Interceptor's Wish, I decline. 

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,5])

Defeat or run from the first Regice. In the next area, head up for a harder fight.

!boss("ICESOLDIER", "Frozen Dimensional Field")

### .Karma File: Damien & Alexandra

Once you're back in Zeight, you'll be able to see the progress we've made on the Karma Files so far. You can also attempt the gauntlet from earlier again at the computer.

Exit Zeight. This next section is a bit different depending on if Karen is Alive or if Karen is Dead.

If Karen is alive, read the note from Gliscor outside of Zeight, then head to Alamissa Urben next to find Ryland in the center. You'll have to find the Johto Legendary trio and challenge each to a battle on the Desert Field.

If Karen is dead, head to Alamissa Urben and enter the room at the bottom where Celine is being preserved. Talk to Alexandra inside. You'll have to battle the Johto Legendary trio and challenge each to a battle on no field.

Suicune is down and to the left if Karen is alive:

!boss("GERBIL2", "Desert Field / No Field")

The fight dramatically changes after a shield break: par for the course for a boss battle by now. What you should know is that you can actually catch **Suicune** once all of its shields have broken!

On the right side of the area if Karen is alive, you'll find Raikou:

!boss("GERBIL3", "Desert Field / No Field")

As before, once all its shields are broken, you can catch **Raikou**!

Finally, in the top left of Alamissa if Karen is alive is Entei.

!boss("GERBIL1", "Desert Field / No Field")

Break all the shields to catch **Entei**!

Catching all three wraps this section!

### .Karma Files: Erin & Aelita

Enter the Rose Theater for the event. Talk to Crescent in the hot spring on the right:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Extreme sadness. (Neutral)
- Hopelessness (Neutral)
- Happiness! (+1 Crescent)
- What is this question?! (-2 Crescent)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's okay to remember. (+2 Crescent)
- Don't forget them. (-2 Crescent)

Talk to Texen in the spa over, too. Inside, you can talk to various characters in the rooms on the left, and to Aelita and Eldest outside on the left. 

Talk to Erin in the upstairs room when you are ready to proceed, then to the Kimono Girl in the restaurant. Return to Erin.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Is it handwritten? (+2 Erin)
- Can you tell who wrote it? (Neutral)

Talk to Texen in the spring and return to Erin. Climb the ladder that appears in the hallway. Next, enter the theater downstairs from the bottom.

!dbattle(["Sesilia",:KIMONOGIRL2,1], ["Enya",:KIMONOGIRL2,1], "Beach Field")

Return to the theater and enter the pocket dimension upstairs.

*Special Scene: Erin's Secret* requires 10+ Relationship Points with Erin at this point.

### Zeight Gauntlet

At this point, you need to finally defeat the gauntlet in Zeight. This works similar to Glass in Reborn: your Pokemon will be fully healed between fights, but fallen Pokemon will not be revived.

!battle(["01010010 01110110",:TREAT_01,0], "Deep Earth Field")

!battle(["01000001 01000101",:TREAT_02,0], "Deep Earth Field")

!battle(["01001101",:TREAT_03,0], "Deep Earth Field")

Gauntlets are very rough. You train the whole game to get used to using Pokemon in such a way that getting one knockout per Pokemon is enough to win a fight. A gauntlet like this one makes it so that each of your Pokemon has to knock out three Pokemon on average. And the opponents here are all of our allies with their very powerful and varied teams, meaning winning this gauntlet is no small feat. Whether it's training new team members, playing with trial-and-error to figure out where the AI will target its attacks in each fight so you can gain some momentum, etc.

The good news with this gauntlet is that you have a lot of room to work with on the Deep Earth Field as well as via a move like Trick Room. There are tons of ways to slow your Pokemon down on the Deep Earth Field - making use of them to steamroll your opponents' mostly fast teams is probably the easiest strategy here. Similarly you can opt for a way to overwhelm them with speed control: Sticky Web, Tailwind, Sun/Chlorophyll or Rain/Swift Swim, etc. can all be very viable here. The game has been generous enough to give you a bunch of really strong tools by this point in the game - abuse them to the best of your ability to come out on top.

### .Karma File: Amber

In the concert hall, you get to press left and right to choose the music. Once you are done, end the concert.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- With Amber Points >= 10 and having Saved Amber at Valor, watch the concert (+3 Amber, +2 Aelita)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- They'd support you. (+1 Amber)
- They'd probably laugh. (-1 Amber)
- Maybe they'd cringe. (+2 Amber)

### .Karma File: Spacea & Tiempa (Paragon)

In Amberette Town, enter the portal for another gauntlet. Thankfully, you will be fully healed between these two bosses.

!boss("TIEMPAGOOD", "Deep Earth Field")

The fight against Tiempa shouldn't be too terrible, all things considered. Her gimmick is making you really slow, which means you have to say goodbye to speed control. That is, unless you opt for Trick Room, in which case winning this one shouldn't be too bad with a few strong super effective moves.

!boss("SPACEAGOOD", "Deep Earth Field")

Spacea is another beast altogether. Ignore the "Minior" autogenerated above: for every shield you break... Spacea will just STEAL YOUR POKEMON. She simply steals your Pokemon and fills its health to full. If there is a silver lining to speak of, its that she likes to use Surf, meaning you can opt for Protect or Wide Guard to have her faint your own Pokemon. This also means there's a bit of gaming to do in regards to *which* Pokemon you let her have - the lower their HP, the more easily you can knock them out. With very careful planning, you even can let her steal a Pokemon with Water Absorb that doesn't have much offensive power to even the playing field - she can't steal a new Pokemon while she already has an ally. Alternatively, if you intentionally knock out your own Pokemon while it is on Spacea's side, it will return to your party with the same status as before, so you can plan around having your Pokemon back on your side if you wish.

You'll find yourself in the cold, grey, mysterious world once again. Interact with the glowy thingy below.

Erin will ask you for two passwords. Of course, they are "POKEMON" and "REJUVENATION".

After reading the files, head up at the Zorrialyn Coast.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're not an outlier... (Neutral)
- Is this really okay? (-2 Crescent)
- It was a good idea. (+1 Crescent)

That is a wrap on the .Karma Files content for the Paragon Route :]
