## Complete the V13.5 Dex

At the moment, Rejuvenation has no rewards for Pokedex Completion. The 100% player may still want to achieve maximal dex completion - in this section I will help us get there. Throughout the guide have been static, wild, and event Pokemon - there remain many evolutions of these Pokemon plus some breeding needed to finish the Pokedex. In general, you'll need to frequent these locations:

- A breeder, to get Exp. Candy XL. Sashila Village has the best one.
- The daycare in Sheridan, to breed.
- The move relearner in Sheridan, to relearn key moves.
- The Purify Chamber at the PC
- The Somniam Mall to buy evolution items

In general, evolutions and breeding mechanics are exactly the same as in the canon games. Where evolution methods and the like differ, I detail below.

- All trade evolutions can be triggered via use of the Link Heart item.
- Pikachu evolves into **Raichu (Alolan)** via Apophyll Pancakes.
- Cubone evolves into **Marowak (Alolan)** at Lv. 28 at Night, in areas such as Goldenleaf Town
- Koffing evolves into **Weezing (Galarian)** at Lv. 35 in areas such as West Gearen City
- Mime Jr. evolves into **Mr. Mime (Galarian)** when leveled knowing Mimic in areas such as Evergreen Island
- Eevee evolves into **Leafeon** either when leveled at the Great Terajuma Falls or via Leaf Stone.
- Eevee evolves into **Glaceon** either when leveled in the Evergreen Cave North basement or via Ice Stone.
- Eevee evolves into **Sylveon** when leveled with high friendship while it knows a Fairy move - consequently it only evolves into **Espeon** and **Umbreon** without a Fairy move, at day and night respectively.
- Quilava evolves into **Typhlosion (Hisuian)**, Dewott into **Samurott (Hisuian)**, and Dartrix into **Decidueye (Hisuian)** via Ancient Teachings.
- Qwilfish (Hisuian) evolves into **Overqwil** by leveling up knowing Barb Barrage.
- Stantler evolves into **Wyrdeer** by leveling up knowing Psyshield Bash.
- Nosepass evolves into **Probopass**, Magneton evolves into **Magnezone**, and Charjabug evolves into **Vikavolt** either when leveled in the West Gearen Power Plant generator room or via Thunderstone.
- Petitil evolves into **Lilligant (Hisuian)** when a Sun Stone is used in areas such as Sheridan Village.
- Basculin (White-Striped) evolves into **Basculegion** by leveing up knowing Double-Edge.
- Yamask (Galarian) evolves into **Runerigus** if it is leveled up with a difference between Max and Current HP of at least 49, on a map such as Wispy Chasm.
- Rufflet evolves into **Braviary (Hisuian)** at Lv. 54 in areas such as Evergreen Island.
- Inkay evolves into **Malamar** only if you mash B during its Lv. 30 evolution.
- Goomy evolves into **Sliggoo (Hisuian)** at Lv. 40 in areas such as the Kingdom of Goomidra.
- Bergmite evolves into **Avalugg (Hisuian)** via a Fire Stone.
- Milcery evolves into **Alcremie** at Lv. 42.

As for the Aevian forms, assume they evolve the same as their base forms, except in these cases:

- Paras (Aevian) evolves into **Parasect (Aevian)** via Xen Waste.
- Munna (Aevian) evolves into **Musharna (Aevian)** via Nightmare Fuel.
- Misdreavus (Aevian) evolves into **Mismagius (Aevian)** via Leaf Stone.
- Roselia (Aevian) evolves into **Roserade (Aevian)** via Sun Stone.
- Snorunt (Aevian) evolves into **Glalie (Aevian)** at Lv. 42, or a female can evolve into **Froslass (Aevian)** via Water Stone.
- Swadloon (Aevian) evolves into **Leavanny (Aevian)** via leveling while knowing Dragon Claw.
- Litwick (Aevian) evolves into **Lampent (Aevian)** via leveling while knowing Zap Cannon, which then evolves into **Chandelure (Aevian)** via Thunderstone.
- Toxel evolves into **Toxtricity (Aevian)** via a Fire Stone.

The following table lists the chances of each item being generated in a mining rock:

- **hardmode**: noitems, nopenny, fullevs, emptyivs
- **qol**: easyhms, nopoisondam, freeexpall, earlyincu, pinata, unrealtime

#### The Terajuma Password

The Terajuma Password is an interesting one: it starts you off midgame in Chapter 5, as soon as the Xen Ship hits Terajuma Island before the Valarie gym battle. This point was likely chosen because the story contains no splits before this point. You will get all the necessary bag items, badges, and story progression flags thrown such that you can continue the playthrough. Most interestingly, you actually will get a pre-built team based on which character profile you go with here, so feel free to experiment with which profile has which Pokemon. These teams have some Pokemon Forms, Mega Stones, etc. that aren't available otherwise!

The other notable thing is that the game defaults you with a massively large or small amount of Karma depending on whether you choose Paragon or Renegade: Plus or minus 100 respectively. That makes this the easiest way to sail into the Renegade Route on a second playthrough. The latter choice also puts -5 Relationship Points on most characters by default.
