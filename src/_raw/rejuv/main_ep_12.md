# Chapter 12: Remember, I Love You

Talk to Aelita on the bridge.

Before we continue the story, head over to Luck's Tent on Route 7. There is a new Move Tutor!

!tutor("Marley Move Tutor", [["Sky Attack", "4 Green Shards"], ["Icy Wind", "4 Red Shards"], ["Tailwind", "4 Yellow Shards"], ["Baton Pass", "4 Blue Shards"], ["Encore", "4 Red Shards"], ["High Horsepower", "4 Green Shards"], ["Agility", "4 Blue Shards"], ["Crunch", "4 Yellow Shards"], ["Blaze Kick", "4 Red Shards"]])

Enter the Hospital of Hope after your conversation with Aelita on the bridge. Inside the hospital, talk to Melia. Return to the Grand Dream Station and talk to Aelita.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- All responses at GDS (-2 Aelita)

## Route 9

!enc(254, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Talk to the Braviary Post to activate this location. The train between GDC and Route 9 is fairly expensive, so I recommend flying between Route 9 and Yui's Ranch then taking the Grand Bridge into the city if needed, for now.

!battle(["Nadia",:CHANELLER,0])

!battle(["Andy",:BLACKBELT,0])

Go up from here and cross the one-tile bridge to the left, below the cave entrance.

!battle(["George",:HIKER,0])

**ZCell 109: Route 9**

!img("zcell109.png")

We'll do the cave a bit later. Head down to the beach, which is filled with wild Sandygast, and surf to the top.

**ZCell 110: Route 9**

!img("zcell110.png")

Enter this cave entrance. For completing the SPU Parcel Delivery quest earlier, we can get **Dewpider**!

Surf back to the mainland of Route 9. Hidden on Route 9, you'll find a *Calcium*, *Carbos*, *Big Mushroom*, *Resist Wing*, and *Swift Wing*. 

Next, enter the main entrance to the cave to the northeast.

!enc(419, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard*, then head into the room at the top with the crystal and pick up a hidden *Pretty Wing* as well as:

**ZCell 111: Forlorned Cavern**

!img("zcell111.png")

Exit out the bottom to catch more **Sewaddle (Aevian)** if you wish.

That's all we can do in this section of the cave, so head back out and go to the left, where the hiker is, and enter this cavern. At the top, use rock climb to grab an *Ability Capsule*. There's also a *Dusk Stone* hidden behind the rock smash path at the bottom. Pick up the hidden *Mineral Ball* and *Ether* as you go to the right.

Exit at the top right, then pick up the hidden *Muscle Wing* and follow the path to the next cave entrance. There is a hidden *Clever Wing* and *Soda Pop* along this path: follow it to get *TM35 Flamethrower*! The tree here also has hidden *Honey* in it. 

Return to the main part of Route 9. Make your way to the northwest: there is a breeder here, and each time you win, you will get *7 Exp. Candy L*.

!battle(["Philip",:POKEBREEDER_M,0])

That's all the exploring on this map we can do for now, so continue northwest onto the next. At the fork, go left. Use cut on the bamboo to encounter **Komala**! Surf across:

**ZCell 112: Route 9**

!img("zcell112.png")

Enter the theater.

## Rose Theater

Enter the room above.

**ZCell 113: Rose Theater**

!img("zcell113.png")

Exit the southwestern most door of the theater, and you'll grab *TM120 Solar Blade*. There is also a hidden *Fresh Water* nearby. Exit the southeasternmost door to grab a *Flying Memory*. If you exit one of the top doors of the theatre, you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball* and listen in on a conversation between Souta and Eldest.

Head up the stairs located in the room behind the stage, and enter the left door. After the conversations, talk to Aelita again in the restaurant downstairs on the right side.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I do. (Neutral)
- I'm not sure... (Neutral)
- You can be aggressive... (-3 Aelita)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- That ribbon... (+2 Melia)
- You okay? (+2 Kanon)
- Took you guys long enough. (+1 Aelita, -3 Melia, -2 Kanon)

You'll be asked to type a name.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Answer "Nymiera" (+2 Damien)

Go back upstairs and talk to the group in the third room. We will use this crystal in a bit, though there is a quest we will take care of real quick.

## Kimono Girls Quest

Talk to the Kimono Girl, Ayuna, on the stage in Rose Theater, to start the Kimono Girls Quest. Their locations:

First, we find Kimono Girl Beatrice. She is in the Judicial District Police Department, but she needs us to do something first. Head to Route 9 and go to the beach and fight the white-haired guy here.

!battle(["Simon",:COOLGUY,0])

Afterwards, return to Beatrice.

Second is Kimono Girl Lana: She is in the District of Hope towards the upper left side. She's having a nightmare though, so return to the Dream Complex and take a nap. You'll find her in the Nightmare Toy Box's casino. Save her from **Sableye**. Finally, meet her at the District of Hope once more. The last few Kimono Girls:

- Third is Kimono Girl Efi, to the east at the Grand Bridge below GDC. She will give you a *Pearl*.
- Fourth is Kimono Girl Midori, at the top of Oblitus Town.
- Fifth is Kimono Girl Sesilia, located in the right room on the second floor of Darchlight Manor. Answer "No".
- Sixth is Kimono Girl Eyna, who is in the Honec Woods Shrine area on the western side.
- Seventh is Kimono Girl Ruka, who is on Route 9 where the Flamethrower TM was, via Forlorned Cave.

Once you've found them all, next, head back to the Rose Theater and talk to Ayuna. You're going to have to fight all 8 Eeveelutions in a row!

!battle(["Lana",:KIMONOGIRL2,0])

!battle(["Beatrice",:KIMONOGIRL2,0])

!battle(["Midori",:KIMONOGIRL2,0])

!battle(["Efi",:KIMONOGIRL2,0])

!battle(["Sesilia",:KIMONOGIRL2,0])

!battle(["Ruka",:KIMONOGIRL2,0])

!battle(["Enya",:KIMONOGIRL2,0])

!battle(["Ayuna",:KIMONOGIRL2,0])

Set up the best team possible and take on this gauntlet. Win, and you'll get a shiny Eevee with special moves and an *Ice Stone*! Head down to talk to the hiker in the crowd, to get another *Somniam Mall Stamp*! Talk to the woman to the left to get the *Sawsbuck Crest*!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Complete the Kimono Girls Quest (+1 Erin)

We can return to GDC to do some shopping at the Somniam Mall now if we wish:

!shop("Somniam Mall Battle Items + Vitamins", ["HP Up", "Protein", "Iron", "Carbos", "Calcium", "Zinc"])

!shop("Somniam Mall Battle Items + Vitamins", ["Sticky Barb", "Lagging Tail", "Iron Ball", "Binding Band", "Float Stone", "Eject Button", "Red Card", "Ring Target", "Metronome"])

## Returning to Past Aevium

Return to the Rose Theater and talk to the Timesplicer Crystal on the upper floor.

Exit the cave you appear in onto Route 4, which has no encounters (for now). Follow the path down and to the right.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes (Vivian +1)
- Uh... (Vivian -1)

Next you have to fight a Level 1 Deoxys. Obviously it is easy, but:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Lose to Lv. 1 Deoxys (Aelita -1, Vivian -1)
- Run away from Lv. 1 Deoxys (Aelita -2, Vivian -2)

There are encounters now.

!enc(106, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Return to Kugearen City and talk to Erin. Get $5000 from Katsu in Kugearen, then accept the fast travel. Once in Amberette Town, enter the right house and get the *Time Gear Amulet*!

Take the driver to Kugearen then go east through the woods to get to Sheridan Village.

!enc(127)

Head north to the scene that plays out.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You okay? (Melia +2, Erin +1)
- Ready for tea?! (Erin +2, Melia +1)

At the top of the village, use your Itemfinder to get a *Meadow Plate* and *Yellow Shard*. Enter Vivian's house, and prepare for a battle. You get 3 Pokemon.

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT_2,2])

!dbattle(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL,4], ["Melia",:ENIGMA_1,1])

Exit, and go to Cella's house in the upper right.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm in! (Neutral)
- Can I think about it? (Neutral)
- Gotta go... (Melia -2, Aelita -2, Erin -2)

After the scene, go to bed in the guest house. Then, enter Vivian's house to the left. Follow her up, then attempt to leave.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- My friends (Aelita +2)
- My family (Aelita +1)
- Myself (Aelita -1)
- I'm not sure (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes (Aelita +1)
- No (Aelita -1)

Once you get control again, enter the Heracross Woods.

!enc(244)

Grab the *Max Repel* and hidden *Ultra Ball* and *Tiny Mushroom*. Chase this Heracross into the bottom right part of the forest, then sneak underneath the twigs in the bottom of the right side to sneak up on Heracross. Run to the top left part of the forest. Then, re-enter the village after Aelita's amulet gets taken. Talk to Aelita by the berries.

Go upstairs and interact with the table to get the *Garufa Spellbook*. Head down the stairs after the scene and confront Vivian at the top.

!battle(["Vivian",:SENSEI_1,0], "Blessed Field")

This one honestly isn't too bad, but her team does make good use of the field. Her Mega Alakazam will outspeed most Pokemon and its field boosted Psychic is brutal, so you want to find some way to outspeed and one shot it. Watch out for the Assault Vest pair - they can eat up super-effective moves easily and hit back with wide coverage.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You okay? (Melia +2)
- What's up? (Neutral)
- Can we leave now? (Melia -1)

## Aevium's Potential Future

After the battle, you'll be whisked away. After a few scenes, head up and into the cave. Talk to Amber in the garden, then Kenneth in the cave. Go to sleep.

!battle(["Carlos",:RENEGADEM,0], "Cave Field")

!battle(["Lilian",:RENEGADEF,0], "Cave Field")

Next, you'll regain control in a jail cell on the Renegade ship. Talk to Granny to get blankets, then to Kenneth, then to the egg.

Head up one level and avoid the shattered glass as you beat grunts. 

!battle(["Harold",:RENEGADEM,0])

!battle(["Xeya",:RENEGADEF,0])

Push the red button. Head up another level. The PC and healing star are here.

!battle(["Andrew",:RENEGADEM,0])

!battle(["Samantha",:RENEGADEF,0])

!battle(["Wellington",:RENEGADEM,0])

Beat the grunts as you push the blue and yellow buttons in this room. Head up again and go past the dead lasers, then up the stairs. Follow the path.

!battle(["Valarie",:CAPTAIN,0], "Murkwater Field")

As in her last fight, the Swift Swim can catch you off guard, but this team is certainly much less threatening. Electricity tears through most of it as before, and a Ghost / Psychic / Dark core can also do wonders here. You can also change the field to Icy Field by using Blizzard if Murkwater is too tough.

Head back up and outside to the deck.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We needed a new sail... (Melia +2)
- She loves her new job. (Melia +1)
- Yes. (Neutral)

Enter the captain's room to speak with Madame X, then talk to the red panel in the room to the right. In the nature room, talk to Melia.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Who knows... (Melia +1)
- Why does it matter? (Melia -2)
- It's necessary. (Melia +2)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Melia Points >= 5 at this moment (+5 Melia)

Head down to the bottom to talk to the crew again. Once you wake up, exit the boat via the deck. Follow the path and watch the scenes.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We must press on (Melia +2, Keta +2)
- It's hopeless... (Melia -2, Keta -2)

In the room to the right, there are encounters!

!enc(461)

Head out and up, into the right room and read the book thing here. Do the same for the left room. Then enter the top room. Kenneth will deal damage to you before this battle, though interestingly, if you have 20+ points with Melia, you will not take this damage.

!battle(["Kenneth",:SURVIVOR,0], "Chess Board")

A bit harder of a fight this time especially thanks to the Chess Board. Be extra wary of his Lucario who hits like a truck and has priority. A well built Chess Board team can handle him - a powerful, slow Pokemon as the King, a lead who can take advantage of the Pawn's Focus Sash effect, etc.

Up ahead, we're going through a maze. The maze contains some maids to fight.

!battle(["Oprah",:SERVANT,1], "Chess Board")

!battle(["Amy",:SERVANT,1], "Chess Board")

!battle(["Iana",:SERVANT,1], "Chess Board")

!battle(["Olga",:SERVANT,1], "Chess Board")

The order of doors we must go through to complete it is as follows: LUURULDD.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Finish the door maze in time (+5 Melia)

Next is a battle against Melia.

!battle(["Melia",:ENIGMA_1,4], "Chess Board")

Another tough Chess Board fight! Every one of her Pokemon are pretty threatening in some way. Zoroark likes to prank you and murder with field boosted Sucker Punch. It also gets to inherit the ability and STAB of whatever it is copying, so be very wary of that. If Meganium gets off an Ancient Power with boost, its bulk may lead it to a sweep. That said, you can overwhelm her: she has weaknesses to Poison and Fighting, so using the Pawn, King, and Queen positions to deal heavy damage with these types may work. Note that you need not win this fight to proceed.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- About what? (Neutral)
- Sigh (Melia -3)

Time for a story choice. **Hand It Over** is a game over and causes (+10 Renegade Points), **Abandon Them** is a passing grade in the sense the game will continue, but causes (+10 Renegade Points), but you can also let the timer expire to **Do Nothing**.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay?! (Melia +2)
- uh... You good? (Neutral)
- What happened? (Neutral)

Time to play as Melia. Follow the path!

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_1,4])

!battle(["Emma",:HOOD,11])

A pretty easy fight for her team. You'll be returned to your own self next, now with Melia as a partner.

!partner(["Melia",:ENIGMA_1,4])

!battle(["Melanie",:LITTLEDEMON,0], "Chess Board")

The news is good: Melia is your ally, so this is a 12v8. The team still hits very hard on the Chess Board, so you'll need to do your best to keep Melia's team alive and use doubles strategies to come out on top.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We have to go. (Neutral)
- It was fun. (Neutral)
- Where's the exit? (Mosely -2)

Enter the door and return to the past.

## Finishing Up in Past Aevium

After returning to the past, head into Sheridan Village and go up. Enter the sacrificial chamber.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I remember! (Melia +2)
- What are you talking about? (Melia +1)
- We have to save Vivian! (Melia -1)

!boss("VIVIANREGIROCK", "Blessed Field")

Thankfully this fight isn't too bad. Regirock is slow and doesn't have that much SpD, so you can wear it down. It can't heal stat drops nor status conditions, either.

**Relationship Point Choices**
- We make a good team! (Melia +2)
- I did all the work. (Melia -2)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Catch it! (Melia +1)
- Leave it in the wild. (Neutral)

Go down to the dock, then talk to Spacea and Tiempa. 

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Have >= 45 Melia Points at this moment (+4 Melia)

Take the Timesplicer Crystal back to the present!

## Missing Children

Remember the GDC arc? Yeah, this is still the same game. Before we continue the story from here, we're gonna do some side quests!

Head to the Central Building in GDC, and into the left elevator to engage with these. Accept Missing Children first.

First thing we're gonna do is head to the Police Department in the Judicial District. Talk to Officer Jenny with the ! above her head.

Make your way to the Night Market. Talk to the man guarding a door on the left side, then go up. Talk to the man in the bottom left corner of the Night Market.

Return to Jenny to cancel the request, though we're not through with it yet! Return to the guy in the Night Market. Use the password on the left side to get access.

Welcome to the Underground. Enter the right building below. 

!shop("The Underground Shop (Left)", ["Metal Powder", "Cell Battery", "Magnet", "Quick Powder", "Blast Powder"])

We can *finally* purchase Blast Powder. Get a ton of it so we can later backtrack to use it to get items and such.

!shop("The Underground Shop (Right)", ["Oval Stone", "Sticky Barb", "Charcoal", "Light Ball", "Leek", "Float Stone", "Binding Band"])

Pricey as they are, we are eventually going to need 12 Charcoal for a quest later.

Go to the left. Inside the Pokemon Center, you can start the *Particia's Letter* quest. Drop the letter in the mailbox by the lift then return to Particia to finish the quest.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you two... okay? (Neutral)
- You seem close. (+1 Particia)

Back outside:

!battle(["Devin",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "Back Alley")

!battle(["Emanuel",:ROCKER,0], "Back Alley")

Enter the mart to the left if you want to buy something.

!shop("The Underground Mart", ["Ultra Ball", "Dusk Ball", "Hyper Potion", "Revive", "Full Heal"])

Enter the casino at the bottom. You can pay $15,000 for the password "BYE CAROTOS". Upstairs, cross the bridge to enter the other building. The Pokemon Psychologist, who changes a Pokemon to a random nature for 1 Heart Scale, is here. Go down from Dylan in the top left to reach a *Toxic Orb* plus:

**ZCell 114: The Underground**

!img("zcell114.png")

Backtrack to the building on the right side with stuff for sale. You can input our password here to enter the back room, where Pokemon are for sale!

!shop("The Underground Pokemon Sale", [["Furfrou", "8 Yellow Shards", true], ["Charmander", "10 Red Shards", true], ["Joltik", "2 Yellow Shards", true], ["Happiny", "6 Blue Shards", true], ["Mimikyu", "7 Yellow Shards", true]])

Buying them all awards you with a *Fire Memory*.

Talk to Dylan above. Enter the Bladestar Labs building to the west of the lift, and talk to the person behind the counter.

!battle(["Tirgon",:BLADESTAR_M,1])

!battle(["Tiler",:BLADESTAR_M,0])

!battle(["Tenson",:BLADESTAR_M,0])

!battle(["Sahrah",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

Pick up the *Hyper Potion* and hidden *Mystery Bowl* and *PP Up*.

!dbattle(["Pati",:BLADESTAR_F,0], ["Niccie",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

!dbattle(["Xander",:BLADESTAR_M,0], ["Xina",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

Once you win, head down to the Fortune Teller's house and talk to her outside. Talk to Ana.

On the next day, return to Dylan's house.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sounds good. (+1 Dylan)
- Er... (-1 Dylan)

Enter the fortune teller's house with Ana. Head into the mart to the left of the Pokemon Center to talk to the clerk here, then watch the video. Return to Peony. Talk to Particia in the Pokemon Center next, then return to Dylan. Accept the fast travel offer to get to Route 9. Head down to talk to them. Then, watch the scene play out in Dylan's House. 

Return to Dylan's house once more, then exit.

!battle(["Nesto",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Back Alley")

Enter the diner to the right. Accept the fast travel again. You'll battle Ana: let her win if you wish.

!battle(["Ana",:NANO,0])

That's all we can do in this quest for now!

## Classified Information

Back in the Central Building, take the request. Talk to the woman in the lobby right of the elevator to get to the 36F of the building.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I was terrified too... (Melia +2)
- It's standard procedure. (Melia +1)
- Grow up. (Melia -2)

Head back into the room. Give Anabel a Nightmare Medallion, then exit. We'll need a new Nightmare Medallion for ourselves, so head over to the Night Market at night to buy one from Peony.

Go to bed in the penthouse to return to the Nightmare Toy Box. Talk to Anabel in the foyer, then again to the left. After your conversation, wake up, and return to Anabel and Looker. Accept Looker's travel request to Darchlight Caves.

Using the mirror, make your way all the way through the cave almost back to the Darchlight Mirror crafting room. Accept Looker's offer to jump the fence, then talk to Anabel in the left room. 

Talk to Looker and reenter the office.

**Relationship Point Choices**:

- Glad to help. (Melia +3, Erick +2)
- I kinda got baited into this... (Erick +3, Melia +2)
- Eh... (Erick +1, Melia -2)

Talk to Looker again to return to the Bladestar Labs. Talk to the door while in the hallway and present the Rose Badge to the door. Inside, grab the *Code Drifio Rift Notes*.

!boss("RIFTFERROTHORN", "Volcanic Field")

This is a tough battle. Its first two shields see a more defensive build that can wear you down with respectable damage from Fire Lash and Gyro Ball, while the latter two phases see it change to an offensive powerhouse that stops for no one.

Status conditions are permanent, so Paralysis can be extremely helpful in getting the edge on this thing. Trick Room can also be helpful for getting around the massive speed of the second form. It is doubly weak to Ground-type moves, so that will probably be your best offensive option.

Once you emerge victorious, accept the fast travel. Talk to Looker and Anabel on 36F to get the *Rift Notes*.

Return to the help center to get $25000 and a *Somniam Mall Stamp*!

!shop("Somniam Mall Rare Berries", ["Occa Berry", "Passho Berry", "Wacan Berry", "Rindo Berry", "Yache Berry", "Payapa Berry", "Tanga Berry", "Charti Berry", "Custap Berry", "Chople Berry"])

!shop("Somniam Mall Rare Berries", ["Kebia Berry", "Shuca Berry", "Coba Berry", "Haban Berry", "Kasib Berry", "Colbur Berry", "Babiri Berry", "Chilan Berry", "Roseli Berry"])

Buy at least five Occa and Passho Berries each for later.

Return to Darchlight Caves and make your way all the way back to the room where you fought Ferrothorn, interact with the panel in the back, then enter the right room. Read the journal and use the Itemfinder in here to get *Dubious Disc*!

## Golden Wing Badge

Return to the Rose Theater, and head to the backyard. It's gym battle time!

!battle(["Souta",:LEADER_SOUTA,0], "Sky Field")

!move("HEAVENLYWING")

!move("ETHEREALTEMPEST")

The year is 2002. GameFreak releases the third generation of Pokemon, my personal favorite! Upping the ante from the previous generations, Ruby and Sapphire will bring back weather conditions from the previous generation, this time, with new powerful legendary Pokemon that can summon them at will: Kyogre with its Drizzle, and Groudon with Drought. With the idea of Emerald surely on their minds, GameFreak was looking to design a Trio Master that could suppress these two legendaries and their abilities. Thus Rayquaza with its signature Air Lock ability would come into being. But... Air Lock has no oomph! It simply cancels other weather conditions, a far less interesting effect than creating synergistic and infinite weather conditions like Kyogre and Groudon can.

We jump a little ahead: the year is 2014. GameFreak wants to do a little power creeping. They opt to remake Ruby and Sapphire during Generation VI. Kyogre and Groudon would get shiny new Primal Forms at this time; each upping the ante from Drizzle and Drought: now each has its own new weather condition: Primordial Sea and Desolate Land. These two weather conditions only last for as long as their wielders are fielded, but are more powerful versions of Sun and Rain and, importantly, cannot be overwritten unless by the other. Yet the Trio Master must grow to meet them too: along comes Mega Rayquaza. Not only would Mega Rayquaza usurp the title of highest BST from the God of Pokemon itself by a whopping 60 points, but it would get its own new ability to match: Delta Stream.
 
Delta Stream is made to be on the same level of power as Primordial Sea and Desolate Land, better than Drought, better than Drizzle. Again importantly, Delta Stream cannot be overwritten, but is balanced by Mega Rayquaza needing to be out on the field. Delta Stream also neutralizes all Ice, Electric, and Rock moves used against Flying types. Mega Rayquaza was so strong the Smogon battle tier literally called "Uber" could not contain the power levels of this creature, leading to the creation of the "Anything Goes" tier.

So, with all this in mind, what happens when a game, maybe one whose name begins with "P" and ends with "okemon Rejuvenation", decides to just... make an entire fight have innate Delta Stream? Against all Flying Pokemon? On top of a the Sky Field, a field custom made for strengthening Flying types via various ability and move buffs? *What happens when this weather cannot be overwritten by any means other than Cloud Nine*? Well.... it means you're in for a ROUGH fight.

Let's look at how this fight plays out. His first Pokemon comes in: a Skarmory that will likely cripple your lead as it has Sturdy, a Liechi Berry, and an insane field boosted single-turn Sky Attack, or perhaps it will use field-extended Tailwind. Unfezant gets a free Defense Boost upon switching in and has all its weaknesses cancelled by the Strong Winds and hits hard with Heavenly Wing and Sky Attack. Multiscale Dragonite won't be missing its Hurricane and Thunder attacks; Oricorio with its crest has just enough Speed and Special Attack to do huge damage; and Aevian Volcarona is a monstrosity that feels custom made to make this battle even harder, for some reason. It is all topped off with another weakness-less Pokemon in Mega Pidgeot who will demolish you with Hurricane, Razor Wind, and Heat Wave. Frequent uses of Tailwind ensure his team is always outspeeding you, Heavenly Wing pulls the field back to Sky Field if you try to change it, and Strong Winds prevent you from getting an easy sweep. It is absolutely PAIN.

I will not pretend that it is impossible, however! Some ideas:

- As stated before, Cloud Nine users can temporarily disable this weather condition, so perhaps Drampa with an Electric move or Golduck with an Ice move can find success. 
- Although I mentioned Heavenly Wing bringing the field back to Sky Field, in this version only two of his Pokemon have this move, meaning we can maybe get away with it. Smack Down or Gravity twice can bring you to Mountain field. If you go for Lava Plume or Blizzard from here, you can take it to Volcano and Snowy Mountain, allowing you to win with some strategy involving Fire/Ice moves respectively. Be cautious: Dragonite can rampage with boosted Thunder in the former and again, flying moves hit hard in the latter. Probably the best field change you can do from Mountain is using Dig to switch to Cave Field, which is a good way to neutralize most of his strategy.
- If you can't beat him, join him! The Sky Field can be beneficial for your team, too: take advantage of your own 8-turn Tailwinds and boosted Flying type moves to outspeed when his Tailwind is off! 
- As usual: TRICK ROOM is a fantastic choice. Older versions of Rejuv didn't let you have the Trick Room TM before this fight, so that may be the single greatest change that can help you turn the tide here.

Win to get the Golden Wing Badge, raising our Level Cap to Lv. 80, and *TM62 Acrobatics*!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay? (Erin +2)
- He doesn't matter. (Erin -4)

You'll also get... *Souta's Cane*. Well, that's interesting.

## The Aelita Incident

Head into the middle room upstairs. After the scene, exit the building.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's save Aelita! (Melia +3, Erin +3)
- Can't Erin just go? (Erin -3, Melia -3)

As soon as you're ready, talk to Erin and agree to enter the rift. Head up and follow the path, it's quite straightforward. Grab the *Code Bella Rift Notes* and continue.

!partner(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL,1])

!boss("RIFTAELITA", "Dimensional Field")

Aelita can be tough: she hits hard with spread moves, she gets Laser Focus applied every few turns, and she's insanely fast. At the same time, you have Erin on your side, so you have a lot of ammunition to take her down: if you get stuck, Trick Room completely trivializes this fight.

Back inside, head into the left room upstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You sure you're okay? (Melia +1, Erin +1)
- ... (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's save Venam! (Melia +3, Erin +2)
- ... (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Welcome back! (Aelita +4)
- Too speedy... (Erin -2, Aelita -2)

That concludes Chapter 12!
