# Chapter 13: Conflicting Renunion

### A Note about Where Love Lies

Completing all the content so far marks the recommended point in the story you should consider going to play Version -1: Where Love Lies, a separate game made by the same creators which acts as a prequel to a part of this story. It is not required that you play it but it gives perspective and history on certain events in this game. You can find it [here](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34082-version-1-where-love-lies/&page=1).

If you want a guide to the side story: Lucifer on the forums wrote up a
[fantastic guide](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34308-spoilers-the-completionists-guide-to-where-love-lies/) to getting 100% in the side game, and so I wouldn't want to waste time by writing my own guide to it.

Now onto the chapter.

## Scholar District

Open the box with Melia and Erin. Head south from Route 9 into GDC's Scholar District.

!enc(257)

!battle(["Jakup",:YOUNGSTER,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Kaya",:GUITARIST,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Ken",:CAMPER,0], "City Field")

Using the itemfinder around this district, you'll find a *Blue Shard*, *Hyper Potion*, *Super Potion*, *Green Shard*, *Ether*, *Max Repel*, *Sitrus Berry*, *Casteliacone*, *Lemonade*, and *Honey*.

Enter the Fan Club. Depending on your GDC reputation, you'll get items at this table. I had 660 at this point and was able to get the items: *10 Exp. Candy XL*, *TM68 Giga Impact*, *GourmetTreat*, and *5 Black Prisms*.

Down and to the left outside is the GDC Arcade.

Enter the student rec. center. In the left room you'll find another game corner! Three of the vendors are exactly the same as in Chrisola, but we can get a few new Pokemon. These are pretty expensive.

!shop("GDC Arcade", [["Rookidee", "3000 Coins", true], ["Mienfoo", "4000 Coins", true], ["Durant", "7500 Coins", true], ["Axew", "9000 Coins", true]])

Enter the Blakeory Museum in the top left side of the District, and pay admission. Someone to the right will give you a random shard: *Blue Shard*, *Red Shard*, or *Green Shard*. To the left is an in-game trade: your Masquerain for **Smeargle**!

At the top, talk to the museum director to finally continue the *Wall of Shame* quest. Make the long journey back to Arturo in the southwestern house of the Judicial District. Back in the museum, head up to learn the painting has been stolen! Outside, you'll see the thief run off. Chase him to The Underground: he's in the shop building to the right of the diner.

!battle(["Nigel",:ROCKER,0], "Back Alley")

You'll get the *Family Portrait*. Return to the gallery if you wish - Arturo and the director both will say they've moved on from this painting, so we get to keep it. It'll be useful later.

Enter the Blakeory Anatheum on the right side of the district. Talk to Erin inside. Return to the lobby and talk to Huey.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Thanks. (+2 Huey)
- Got any more words? (Neutral)

This is a 3v3 battle.

!battle(["Thomas",:STEELRESERVE,0])

Head outside.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay? (Neutral)
- C'mon, it wasn't that bad... (-2 Huey)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Ren's sister! (+2 Reina)
- Uh... (-2 Reina)

From here, the route splits depending on our choices in the Darchlight Caves regarding Flora:

[Don't Expose Flora](#badlands-arc-dont-expose-flora-route) | [Expose Flora](#badlands-arc-expose-flora-route)

## Badlands Arc (Don't Expose Flora Route)

After the meal at the restaurant, head over to the Judicial District. Talk to Allen and Alice at the bottom.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We should go. (+3 Allen, +3 Alice)
- Let's not. (Neutral)

(The other option lets you delay progressing the story if you need to). You'll be taken to the Bladestar Battalion.

!battle(["Ali'yah",:SASHILAWARRIORF_2,0])

Take the elevator to the engine room.

!battle(["Est'ros",:SASHILAWARRIORM_1,0])

Input the password "alamissa" at the bottom. Up in the captain's quarters, go right.

!battle(["Hendris",:SASHILAWARRIORM_1,0])

Head up to the main deck and go all the way left.

!dbattle(["Sy'yo",:SASHILAWARRIORF_2,0], ["Ryland",:LEADER_RYLAND1,0], "City Field")

!move("DESERTSMARK")

It becomes a two-on-one pretty easily, but Ryland's four Pokemon are no joke! Both the Claydol Crest and Torterra Crest drastically change how each is played.

Head out to the right side of the deck to talk to Ryland if you wish.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- All good. (+2 Ryland)
- Communicate next time... (-1 Ryland)

### Sashila Village (Don't Expose Flora Route)

A hidden *HP Up* is to the right. Grab a hidden *Grass Gem* to the right. Go straight up 
and talk to Kanon in the back room.

Before we leave, we can explore the city a little bit. Down from Alexandra's house, there is a breeder to the right who will award you with *5 Exp. Candy XL* for winning.

!battle(["Philip",:POKEBREEDER_M,0], "Desert Field")

Stay on top of the roof and go down and around to the right. Talk to the man here to get access to the Sand Stream Cave. You'll also find:

**ZCell 115: Sashila Village**

!img("zcell115.png")

In the battleground area, you can find a hidden *Max Repel*, *Moon Stone*, and *Link Heart*. Go up through the school area to emerge outside again, and grab the hidden *GourmetTreat*. To the left is a hidden *Lemonade*.

To the left, enter the Study Library. Talk to someone to get the *House Key*! Outside, you can get some lore by paying the Informant below.

!shop("Sashila Shop", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Mineral Ball", "Hyper Potion", "Max Repel", "Burn Heal", "GourmetTreat", "Reverse Candy"])

### Zorrialyn Desert (Don't Expose Flora Route)

Head to the Zorrialyn Coast by exiting Sashila at the bottom.

!enc(515, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Make sure you catch Aevian Budew for Zumi's quest. Interact with **Mandibuzz** flying around for a battle. There are also **Alolan Exeggutor**, **Gligar**, and **Arbok** in various spots in the desert.

Go to the east to find:

**ZCell 116: Zorrialyn Coast**

!img("zcell116.png")

Activate the Braviary Post here. To the right is the final Luck's Tent! Continue further to the right.

Pick up the hidden *Dusk Ball*, *Poke Doll*, *Heart Scale*, and *Red Shard*. To the right is an *Escape Rope*. 

!battle(["Sai'yo",:DESERTDWELLER_FW,0], "Desert Field")

We will do the Zorrialyn Labyrinth later on, so head left and down. Grab the hidden *Dark Gem*, *Dusk Ball*, and *Water Gem*.

Nothing awaits us at the end of the path to the south yet, and we will tackle the area to the east later on, so head up at the northwest corner to reach the Zorrialyn Desert (West).

!enc(510, nil, nil, "Zorrialyn Desert (West)")

You can find a hidden *Occa Berry*, *Sitrus Berry*, *Reverse Candy*, *Yellow Shard*, *Ground Gem*, and *Petaya Berry*, as well as a *Sun Stone* near the entrance to this map. You can use Rock Climb to the left to reach a hidden *Thick Club*, *Calcium*, and *Green Shard*, plus:

**ZCell 117: Zorrialyn Desert**

!img("zcell117.png")

We'll tackle Sand Stream Cave a bit later on. Use Rock Climb on the right side of the map to reach *TM37 Sandstorm* as well as a hidden *Haban Berry* and *HP Up*. You can find a hidden *Hard Stone*, *Rare Bone*, and *Red Shard* across the bridge on the right, plus an *Exp. Candy XL*. Continuing to the left is a hidden *Yellow Shard* and *Thick Club*.

!enc(373, nil, nil, "Zorrialyn Desert (East)")

!battle(["Clidus",:HIKER,0], "Desert Field")

Just a bit down is a hidden *Lemonade*. Continue going down and right to find a hidden *PP Up* and *Heavy Ball* plus an *Iron*. A *Revive* and hidden *Leaf Stone* and *Kebia Berry* are up from here.

!battle(["Jowy",:BLACKBELT,0], "Desert Field")

At the next fork, go left. Hidden behind a Blast Powder rock is a *Synthetic Seed*. Cross under an archway above to reach a hidden *Reverse Candy* and *Revival Herb*, as well as a *Smooth Rock* and *Max Ether*. We will explore Alamissa Urben a bit later.

Go up the stairs in the top right corner of the map. Pick up the hidden *Red Shard*, *Ether*, *2 Max Repels*, and *Yellow Shard*. Activate the Braviary Post here, then enter the Voidal Chasm by walking onto the star at the top.

**ZCell 118: Zorrialyn Desert**

!img("zcell118.png")

### Voidal Chasm (Don't Expose Flora Route)

You'll find an *Odd Keystone* to the left, plus four hidden *Ethers*. Talk to the sign, then to the small drip of water to proceed.

In the next area, talk to the sign then to the white rock on the right. A path will open to the left.

In the next area, pick up the *White Herb* and three hidden *Ethers*. Finding these Ethers is actually the solution to the next puzzle. Before we leave the area, talk to the sign in the northwest to get a clue about what to do here. We can't yet get Falinks, but we will return later. Take the warp on the right to the next area.

!battle(["???",:UNKNOWN_1,3], "Dimensional Field")

You'll be taken back to Sashila Village. Head to the inn and enter the room in the back, and agree to sleep. The [routes converge](#hospital-of-ruin) from here.

## Badlands Arc (Expose Flora Route)

!battle(["Miya",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

Board the train outside.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You just kidnap people? (+2 Reina, +1 Huey)
- Yes, it's quite nice. (Neutral)

!battle(["Beybe",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Factory Field")

!battle(["Dale",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Factory Field")

Exit the train into Bladestar HQ. You'll have to choose one Pokemon for a 1v2 fight:

!battle(["Risa Raider",:POPSTAR,1], "Factory Field")

### Voidal Chasm (Expose Flora Route)

Take the warp to the next area. Grab the two hidden *Ethers*, then attempt to take the warp at the top. Head down and right: you can hop to continue.

Forgive the numbering: the route splitting makes tracking Zygarde Cells in this part of the game... difficult.

**ZCell 119B: Voidal Chasm**

!img("zcell119b.png")

Backtrack and take the previous warp at the top. Follow the path down.

!dbattle(["Keni",:BLADESTAR_M,0], ["Muriel",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dimensional Field")

Grab the hidden *Ether* and *Old Scarf*, then proceed. Grab *TM148 Phantom Force* and exit to the desert!

!enc(510, nil, nil, "Zorrialyn Desert (West)")

You can find a hidden *Hard Stone*, *Rare Bone*, *Red Shard* below, plus an *Exp. Candy XL*. Continuing to the left is a hidden *Yellow Shard* and *Thick Club*. Head back up and cross to the left. You can find a hidden *Reverse Candy*, *Yellow Shard*, *Sitrus Berry*, *Occa Berry*, *Ground Gem*, and *Petaya Berry*, as well as a *Sun Stone*. Double back to the top right side of the map and use Rock Climb to reach *TM37 Sandstorm* as well as a hidden *Haban Berry* and *HP Up*. You can also use Rock Climb a bit to the left to reach a hidden *Thick Club*, *Calcium*, and *Green Shard*, plus:

**ZCell 117: Zorrialyn Desert**

!img("zcell117.png")

Head to the Zorrialyn Coast in the southwest.

!enc(515, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Go to the east to find:

**ZCell 116: Zorrialyn Coast**

!img("zcell116.png")

Activate the Braviary Post here. To the right is the final Luck's Tent! Continue further to the right. 

!battle(["Jai'so",:DESERTDWELLER_MB,0], "Desert Field")

We will do the Zorrialyn Labyrinth later on, so head left and down. Grab the hidden *Dark Gem*, *Dusk Ball*, and *Water Gem*.

Nothing awaits us at the end of the path yet, so head north then west into Sashila Village!

### Sashila Village (Expose Flora Route)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Trust Ren on this. (Neutral)
- Something's wrong. (+3 Reina)

Grab a hidden *Grass Gem* above. Attempt to head north to talk to Alexandra. There is a breeder to the right who will award you with *5 Exp. Candy XL* for winning.

!battle(["Philip",:POKEBREEDER_M,0], "Desert Field")

Stay on top of the roof and go down and around to the right. Talk to the man here to get access to the Sand Stream Cave. You'll also find:

**ZCell 115: Sashila Village**

!img("zcell115.png")

In the battleground area, you can find a hidden *Max Repel*, *Moon Stone*, and *Link Heart*. Go up through the school area to emerge outside again, and grab the hidden *GourmetTreat*. To the left is a hidden *Lemonade*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Ren and Ryland without having helped Ryland on Route 6 (-2 Ryland)

Head to the top of Sashila Village to talk to the group. Enter the inn towards the center of the village and go to sleep.

*Special Scene: The Twin's Fate* requires 3+ Relationship Points with Reina at this point.

## Hospital of Ruin

*Special Scene: The Twin's Fate* requires 3+ Relationship Points with Reina at this point.

Time for another section where we get to control a different character. Exit your room and leave to the left. Talk to the elevator, and head down the shaft.

Head down to talk to the computer at the bottom of the shaft, then head up. Interact with the B1 door to listen in on a conversation. Then, head up to 1F and exit the shaft. In the rightmost room of the floor, read all the computer files in the office.

Back down in the shaft, type 8433 in the console at the bottom.

Down here, enter the room on the left, then press the panel. Enter the room at the top and talk to Braixen. Head to the bottom-right and follow the path.

Choose whether or not to release Giratina - it will join your party for the next fight if you do:

!newself(["Lavender",:LEADER_LAVENDER,4])

!battle(["Edwind",:XENANALYST_M,0], "Factory Field")

If you have Giratina this is winnable, but winning is not necessary.

## Alamissa Urben

We will be in control of ourselves once more.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Leave it to me. (+4 Reina)
- I dunno... (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Alexandra on your way out of Sashila Village (+5 Alexandra)

Talking to her also awards *5 Revives*, *5 Max Potions*, and *5 Exp. Candy XL*.

Exit the village. Attempt to use the House Key in the building all the way at the bottom of Zorrialyn Coast, and it will snap in half. We'll continue that quest a bit later on.

Enter Alamissa Urben at the top of Zorrialyn Desert East. Talk to Ren at the entrance and you'll get **Sylveon**, as well as the *Mysterious Black Box*. 

!enc(518)

Smash some rocks outside to create shortcuts.

!battle(["Kido",:BLADESTAR_M,0])

Itemfind the *2 Yellow Shards* and continue.

!battle(["Shina",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

Grab the hidden *Yellow Shard* outside the left door and climb the ladder.

!battle(["Yuna",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

You can catch **Falinks** here! Smash a shortcut rock and find the hidden *Yellow Shard*. At the bottom of the area is a *Power Bracer*. Enter the right door and go up. Grab another *Poke Toy* and further a hidden *Revive*, *5 Red Shards*, and *3 Yellow Shards*. At the center of the area is a Braviary Post! Enter a building in the top left and go downstairs to get a *Prism Scale*!

Finally, exit the area at the top. Proceed forward when ready.

## Blakeory Atheneum Tour

You'll be playing as Melia once more. Talk to Hazuki in the entrance room. You can input your own question prompts by typing "Thomas Jr.", "Vivian", "Ayame", or "Nymiera".

Return to Erin, then climb the stairs to use the indicated computer at the bottom. After your chat with Thomas, talk to Erin once more.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- 45 <= Melia Points (+6 Erin)
- 10 <= Melia Points < 45 (+2 Erin)
- 0 <= Melia Points < 10 (Neutral)

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_1,5])

!battle(["Luke",:YOUNGSTER,0])

Return to Erin once more. After some scenes:

!battle(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL,2])

Win or lose, the game will continue. Finish watching the wholesome scene and proceed.

## The Third Trip to Past Aevium

!enc(322)

Pick up the *Revive* and hidden *Red Shard*. Across the bridge is a hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Blue Shard*. Pick up the *Max Revive* to the right. Continue to the northeast to enter Hiyoshi City.

!enc(330)

Enter the first building to the right to grab a hidden *Ultra Potion*. At the east side of the town, there is a breeder who will award you with *10 Exp. Candy XLs*.

!battle(["Jimbo",:POKEBREEDER_M,0])

!shop("Hiyoshi City Berries", ["Sitrus Berry", "Chesto Berry"])

!shop("Hiyoshi City Mart", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Super Potion", "Hyper Potion", "Ultra Potion", "Awakening", "GourmetTreat", "Reverse Candy", "Super Repel", "Max Repel"])

!tutor("Hiyoshi City Move Tutor", [["Sky Attack", "3 Red Shards"], ["Skill Swap", "2 Green Shards"], ["Magnet Rise", "2 Yellow Shards"], ["Gravity", "2 Blue Shards"], ["Recycle", "2 Green Shards"]])

These moves we have already had access to for a while, so this seems to be a development oversight that this remains in.

Talk to Hazuki in the northwest of the city, then head into the house via the secret tunnel and talk to Nymiera. Talk to Huey in the corner to get some crazy backstory.

Exit the house and enter the building above with the PC. Hidden in here is an *Ether*. Talk to the group in the southwest area of town. Then, head north to board the truck to Hiyoshi Pass.

!enc(374, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Grab the *TM27 Return* on the right, then head up.

We'll now be playing as Ren!

!newself(["Ren",:OUTCAST,1])

Head up to where your main character passed out. You can talk to surfboard guy multiple times and even input a name to get a unique dialogue (Kieran). Attack or defend, you'll have to battle.

!battle(["???",:UNKNOWN_1,0])

First time we're using Ren's team. Luckily, it's not too awful. Zepto can beat Raichu and dent Swampert, then there's just enough priority and SpD on the team that you can take out  Xurkitree.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Kieran as Ren (+4 Ren)

Head to the south-central square in town. After the scene, head to the Hiyoshi Pass again. Attempt to enter Rejuvenation Co., then head back to the city. Talk to the woman directly above the truck, then head to Route 5. Head west as soon as you can on Route 5 and talk to Anastasia.

!partner(["Anastasia",:RUNAWAYGIRL,0])

!dbattle(["Kenny",:RECO_M,0], ["Jane",:RECO_F,0])

In the building, head west and follow the path, beating all the trainers.

!battle(["Summer",:RECO_F,0])

!battle(["Hayner",:RECO_M,0])

!battle(["Jenny",:RECO_F,0])

!battle(["Mani",:RECO_M,0])

!battle(["Janna",:RECO_F,0])

!battle(["Oswald",:RECO_M,0])

!battle(["Ace",:RECO_M,0])

After the sequence of events, return to Nymiera's house. Talk to the nurse in the inn, then head to the north part of town to engage with the maids. Head straight south. 

!dbattle(["Iana",:SERVANT,0], ["Trish",:SERVANT,0])

Beat the maids, then return to the inn one more time. Enter the tunnel and go up.

We get control of our character again! Return to the tunnel. A butterfly in this area can warp us between here and Sashila Village, should we need to do any preparations.

We're gonna be pushing strength boulders onto the spiked platforms. 

!battle(["Barbara",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

!battle(["Oprah",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

!battle(["Amy",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

!battle(["Olga",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

As soon as you get to the first healing star, grab the *Focus Sash* to the left and press the button on the pillar.

!battle(["Huey",:OPTKID_1,0], "Dimensional Field")

!battle(["Ursula",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

!battle(["Reina",:TRENDYGIRL_1,0], "Dimensional Field")

Another easy one, just make sure you don't get swept by Honchkrow.

Head up and through, grabbing the *Code Angelus Rift Notes*. Oh boy...

!boss("ANGELOFDEATH", "Dimensional Field")

This is a very tough battle. It has FOUR shields, meaning you have to deplete its HP five times. On top of this is its Rift Ralts and Rift Kirlia reinforcements that have doubles-oriented moves like Quash, Poison Gas, and Helping Hand to make things more difficult. Gardevoir's moveset changes at each phase, providing it a massive array of coverage on both the physical and special side. It even gets a massive nuke of a Z-Move in its last phase.

It doesn't have a way to counter any status conditions or stat drops of yours however. Instead of going all in on attacks, you'll need to consider debuffs. Thunder Wave as well as Flash, Screech, Fake Tears are all TMs we have at this point in time, so you can use some combination of them to wear it out then let a couple strong attackers in your party's back take out each health bar.

!partner(["Ren",:OUTCAST,1])

!boss("FALLENANGEL", "Dimensional Field")

Not tough compared to the previous fight, thankfully.

### New Game+ Nightmare Remix

If you have progressed in New Game+ thus far and have the Puppet Doubloon, instead of Gardevoir, you will fight the Nightmare Remix instead:

!partner(["Ren",:OUTCAST,0])

!boss("NIGHTMAREREMIX", "Starlight Arena")

## VS Ren in Sashila Village

Once you get control back, head to Nymiera's house once again. Push the button on the back of the bookcase!

Back in Sashila, head out to the Zorrialyn Coast and go up past the Braviary Post to the Field of Pillars. Talk to Alexandra in front of the obelisk. After the scene, we're gonna head west across the bridge for a battle with Ren! At least we're familiar with his team.

!battle(["Ren",:OUTCAST,0], "Desert Field")

A very, very tough singles battle, in no small part thanks to Protean Greninja. Changing STAB on the fly with one of the best speed stats in the game makes it a very tough opponent. On top of this is Aevian Roserade, Flygon, and Corviknight, all immune to the Desert Field's Sandstorm chip, plus Arcanine and Silvally for hard hitting coverage. Take advantage of priority moves to deal with Greninja and utilize the field to your advantage to win this one.

## Sashila Village Help Quests

It's time for some Quests. Before we get started, if you didn't expose Flora and caught a Falinks in Alamissa Urben, return to the Voidal Chasm. Show Falinks to the sign towards the end of the path to get a *Razor Claw* plus:

**ZCell 119A: Voidal Chasm**

!img("zcell119a.png")

Return to the room where we fought the surfboard guy to find *TM148 Phantom Force* as well as a hidden *Rare Candy* and *Old Scarf*.

It's time for some Help Quests. Enter the door in the middle of Sashila Village, on the left side.

### Legend of the Void

Enter a house above the help center and talk to Marten. Enter the left house towards the bottom of the village next to talk to Hyu'ro. Return to Marten. Exit, and take the Mudsdale rider outside the village to Voidal Chasm.

In the Voidal Chasm, return to near where we entered and pick up the shiny object.

Return to Marten, then meet him in Hyu'ro's house. Enter Sashila's research room to the left of Marten's house. Talk to Marten at the top. Head into Alexandra's room and use the crystal to go back to the past...

Talk to the truck driver in Hiyoshi City and go to Gregorian Lake. Surf up and talk to the guy inside the house here to get a *Lake Postcard*.

Return to the present and talk to Hyu'ro. After talking to Marten at the door, head back to the Voidal Chasm. In the chasm, you will then have to battle an **Absol**! Hyu'ro's fate is up to you. After making your choice, return to Sashila. Re-enter the research area and talk to Marten.

Return to the help center to claim your reward: $12,500 and the *Absolite*! (+1 Karma)

### Badland Baddies

Head back to the research center from the last quest. Talk to the guy at the bottom right and agree to get sprayed.

- Talk to Damien outside after convincing him (+1 Damien)

Return to the help center to claim your reward: $22500, a *Link Heart*, *3 Sitrus Berries*, and *3 Roseli Berries* (+1 Karma).

### My Sister Fell!

Head to the Voidal Chasm. Make your way all the way through the dungeon: you'll find a girl at the bottom. Agree to leave with her.

Head west in the desert, and Rock Climb as soon as possible. You'll see Mandibuzz and the girl on top of a rock climb. Beat Mandibuzz.

Go all the way back to Zorrialyn Coast, and you'll see the Exeggutor by the Braviary Post and pond.

Return to the help center to get $32500 and MegaStone *Abomasite* (+1 Karma)!

### I Need to Get Stronger!

Meet Novae at the bottom of the village. It's battle time...

!battle(["Novae",:WANDERER,3], "Desert Field")

Compared to some of her earlier fights, this isn't that bad. She uses a standard desert-based sun team, meant to catch your leads off guard with powerful Heat Wave and anti-priority. If you can change up the weather, you'll be golden. Alternatively, fighting Fire with Fire works well here, as only her own Ninetales and the frail Lycanroc resist your own Heat Wave.

Return to the help center to get $32500 and a *Scented Lure*. (+1 Karma).

## Sand Stream Cave

You can return to GDC now if you want, but there's even more desert exploration and quests we can do!

Next, we're gonna enter Sand Stream Cave at the top left corner of Zorrialyn Desert West.

!enc(513)

Grab the *Hyper Potion* up here. Hidden in this first room is *2 Yellow Shards*, *Carbos*, *Escape Rope*, *Berry Juice*, and *Grass Gem*.

In order to proceed in the cave, we need a bit of luck: there needs to be stationary Hippopotas roaming the first floor. Exit and re-enter until this condition is met. 

Enter any vortex to reach B1F. There are **Hippowdon** roaming around down here! Jump into the vortex in the sand pit to reach B2F. Grab the *Revive* here on B2F and find a hidden *Red Shard*, then another *Revive* and hidden *Green Shard* and *Rare Candy* past some Rock Climbs. In the center of the room is a hidden *Light Clay*. Grab the *Full Heal*, hidden *Burn Heal*, *Clever Wing*, and *Genius Wing* along the way, plus a *Moon Ball* in the southeast. Take the central vortex to B3F!

!enc(514)

Grab the hidden *Elixir* and climb up. Interact with the space in the ground here and put in the Scented Lure. Then, you'll be able to catch **Trapinch** and **Vibrava**! 

Hidden in this room is a *Green Shard*, *Soft Sand*, *Rock Gem*, *Rawst Berry*, *Sitrus Berry*, *Berry Juice* and *Lava Cookie*.

At the top of the room, you'll find:

**ZCore 1: Sand Stream Cave**

Grab the *Sandacondanite* then exit the cave by climbing the ladder.

## Zorrialyn Labyrinth

Next, we're going to do some treasure hunting. Towards the bottom of Zorrialyn Coast is the entrance to the Zorrialyn Labyrinth. It costs $5500 per trip: we will be booted from the dungeon after a certain number of steps, meaning completion requires multiple trips. Try not to stray too much from the listed paths: there is a bit of wiggle room but not much.

This is all we can do for now in the labyrinth!

## Route 10

Talk to Damien at the top of Sashila and head back to Route 9. There, you'll get *HM02 Fly*! Finally. If you have the Golden Wings you can use these now!

Next, we'll visit a short new route. Just above the breeder on Route 9, head up and right. We can't do anything there yet except catch some Pokemon.

!enc(87, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

You can also catch the overhead **Wingull** and **Pelipper**!

Pick up *TM74 Gyro Ball*. That's it for Route 10. 

A few more quick things to get on Terrial Island: head over to Oblitus Town via Route 7. Talk to the PokeFlute in Kelvin's house and the top and agree to buy it for $45000. Make your way back to the northern clearing of the Honec Woods if you completed the Yui's Ranch quest and use the flute to catch **Snorlax**!

Next, head over to Route 8. You can use Strength on the metal poles to knock off all the Pokemon on the wire, including new **Scyther** and **Hawlucha**! You'll want to catch two Scyther: one to keep, one for a quest. You can do this by exiting and reentering Route 8.

## Aquarium Quest 1

Now that we can fly back to Floria and Terajuma, there are tons of things we can do now with 12 Badges and HM Strength.

Our first destination is the Akuwa Town Aquarium. Back in the SOS room, talk to the director, who will ask us for help with the aquarium. The Pokemon we need to submit are as follows. If you don't care about keeping any of them, submit the ones you already have, otherwise, here are where you can go get more (or breeding is always an option). There are 34 total. We can't fully complete this quest (without some mystery egg luck) until the next chapter, but we can donate most of the Pokemon. I will do minimal evolution / maximal catching to complete this quest for fun, but feel free to evolve Pokemon if you wish.

We start by donating 10. These 10 should be easy to start with:

- Mantyke/Mantine: Mynori Sea Surfing
- Carvanha/Sharpedo: Terajuma Shipyard Surfing
- Pyukumuku: Terajuma Shipyard Static
- Remoraid/Octillery: Amethyst Cave Surfing
- Finneon/Lumineon: Sheridan Village Fishing
- Corsola: Akuwa Town Beach

With 10 Pokemon donated to the aquarium, we will receive $60000 and the *Super Rod*! Our next objective is 20. A few more Pokemon we can easily donate right now:

- Staryu: Terajuma Shipyard Static (Nighttime)
- Chinchou: Darchlight Woods Fishing
- Bruxish: River's End Fishing
- Clauncher: Akuwa Beach Static
- Clamperl: Route 5 Static
- Shellder: Route 10 Fishing
- Wishiwashi: Route 5 Fishing
- Luvdisc: Route 11 Fishing
- Spheal/Sealeo: Evergreen Forest Surfing

For donating 20 Pokemon, we will be paid $60000. Our final target is all 34 Pokemon. There are a few more that we can add to the tank right away:

- Alomomola: Akuwa Town Surfing
- Piplup: Spring of Preservation Static (get two if you haven't)
- **Prinplup**: Evolve a Piplup at Lv. 16
- Empoleon: Spring of Preservation Static

The last 10 Pokemon we will donate later on.

## Neo East Gearen City & Help Quests

Fly over to West Gearen City. On Junction Bridge, push a boulder out of the way - now that we have the Dull Key, open the door here and use a GourmetTreat to get **Litten**! Exit east to the now "Neo" East Gearen City.

There are new trainers to fight and items on each map.

!enc(19, nil, nil, "Neo East Gearen City (Left)")

Grab an Aevian Budew from the PC and enter the Magnolia Library. Show it to Zumi for the *PictoZumi* quest. You'll get *10 Exp. Candy XL* and the *Ampharosite*! Our next Pokemon target is an Aevian Form located in the Axis Factory, which we'll get to later.

Finally, it's time to get another legendary! Head to the Help Center and talk to Ayuda. We have over 100 Cells plus one Core, so we now get **Zygarde 10%**! Talk to him again right after: since we have over 120 Zygarde Cells, we get *5 Cell Imprints*, *20 Exp. Candy XL*, and a *Modest Mint*. Our next target is 140 Cells.

Head down to Oceana Pier. You can trade a Rockruff for a **Rockruff** with Own Tempo, which you can evolve into **Lycanroc (Dusk)**. You can also find a hidden *X Accuracy* and *Sweet Heart*

Head to Neo East Gearen City (Right).

Hidden here is *2 Honeys*, *Leaf Stone*, *Carbos*, *Muscle Wing*, *Blue Shard*, and *Yellow Shard*.

Catch a Level 100 Budew (or catch one that is close, and use Rare Candies). Then, show it to the guy at the bottom to get the *Grassium-Z*.

Enter the Gearen Lab and talk to Jan to begin the *Reborn Again* quest. Then, head outside and talk to Adrienn again.

Enter the sewers with Adrienn. Follow Adrienn into the next room, and pick up the hidden *Blue Shard* and *Green Shard*. In the main room, there is a *Rare Candy*, and the hidden items include *2 Red Shards*, *2 Blue Shards*, *Zinc*, *Potion*. Next, go to the upper right room.

Emerge on the right side of East Gearen and meet Adrienn near the Truck Guy. There are new help quests!

### Poke Ball Conundrum 

Enter the Everglade Mall, which replaces and incorporates the old Berry Shop, Pokeball Emporium, and Salon. Speak to the clerk at the Poke Ball shop.

Attempt to enter the door at the Tecanlite Factory in West Gearen. Head down, and Aya will let you in.

!partner(["Aya",:WPUNK,2])

!dbattle(["Ron",:XENGRUNT_M,0], ["Famuya",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Factory Field")

Pick up all the balls you see around: *Ultra Ball*, *Nest Ball*, and *Dive Ball*.

!dbattle(["Lupin",:XENDEATHWING_M,0], ["Sonia",:XENDEATHWING_F,0], "Factory Field")

Return to the East Gearen Help Center to get your reward - $12356, and the *Aloraichium-Z* (+1 Karma)! You can also return to the Pokeball Emporium in the mall to get 15 *Ultra Balls*. 

### Forest Restoration 

Meet at the Route 1 Train Station, then enter Goldenwood Forest. Talk to Adrienn in front of where we fought Gyarados in Goldenwood Forest.

We're gonna need to submit 3 workers, 1 Scyther, and $48000. Go ahead and submit the money when you have it.

- Worker 1: Community room in Goldenleaf Town
- Worker 2: Xen Battleship sleeping chambers at Terajuma Shipyard
- Worker 3: Kristiline Town Pokemon Center

Return to Adrienn and hand over the Scyther, then ask to see Progress.

This brings the Forest Restoration to Phase 2. Hidden on this version of the map is a *Rare Candy*. You can also find **for a limited time**:

**ZCell 122: Goldenwood Forest (Phase 2)**

!img("zcell122.png")

For the next phase, we're gonna need $58000, 1 Architect, and 3 Fishermen. Submit the money.

- Fisherman 1: East Gearen City near the Route 1 Train
- Fisherman 2: Route 2 near the Kecleon Bazaar

Return to Adrienn and inquire about Progress, bringing the restoration to Phase 3. You can grab another hidden *Rare Candy* above.

For the final phase, we'll need to submit $68000, 7 Tiny Mushrooms, 1 bag of Stardust, and 1 Poliwag.

If you haven't completed the Poliwag search quest, do so now. Feel free to submit that one if you have it, or, if its evolved, breed it. Finishing this quest will let us catch more Poliwag, so don't worry if this is your only one. Grind TinyMushrooms/Stardust off of Paras/Staryu, respectively. Compoundeyes and Thief/Covet will make your hunt quicker. Submit it all to Adrienn.

This completes the restoration of Goldenwood Park!

!enc(217, nil, nil)

Pick up the *Bug Memory* and pluck *2 Lum Berries*, *2 Salac Berries*, *2 Lansat Berries*, an *Enigma Berry*, and *2 Starf Berries*.

**ZCell 123: Goldenwood Park**

!img("zcell123.png")

Talk to the fisherman inside the guild. Instantly the *Magic Karps* quest will be completed (even if you don't have the Super Rod - it seems bugged). Enter the room to the right.

!enc(220, nil, nil)

There is another hidden *Rare Candy* outside, north of where Adrienn and the reporters are. While we're here:

!enc(8, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Talk to Adrienn at the top when you are ready for a battle.

!battle(["Danni",:XENDEATHWING_M,0], "Forest Field")

Return to Grand Hall and talk to Adrienn. 

We'll now have access to the Secret Developer Room downstairs. You can get a *Rare Bone* in the food bowl in exchange for... whiting out. Oops. In the room to the right you can get the *Cryogonal Crest*. In the bottom of the main room is the *Normalium-Z*!

Back upstairs, enter the left room and talk to Jan. Return to the help center to get $250000, and the *Mawilite* (+1 Karma)!

### Mall Opportunities

Head to the Everglades Mall and meet Witch at the very top. Donate $30000 to her.

Then talk to her in the shop to get *Occa Berry*, then give her five back. You'll get a *Passho Berry* next, then have to give her five back once more.

Talk to Witch again, then head to the berry store downstairs. Re-enter the ice cream shop. Then, enter the restaurant next door. Fly to Terajuma Shipyard and fight the Xen member below.

!battle(["Nida",:XENANALYST_F,0], "Beach Field")

You will get $5000. Return to the Le Whoa Restaurant in Gearen, then talk to the officer downstairs. Return to Witch again, then talk to Aya in the Lab.

Return to the help center to get $25840 and the *Altarianite* (+1 Karma)!

### Shipwreck Recovery 1

Talk to the guy at the bottom of Oceana Pier to head out to the Wreckage Site.

**ZCell 124: Wreckage Site**

!img("zcell124.png")

We can talk to Adrienn to progress the quest a bit, but without the next gym badge, we can't progress the quest any more for now.

## Floria Island 12 Badge Quests

That's all we can do in Gearen for now. There are many more places across Floria Island we can explore for more goodies!

Fly to Akuwa Town and make your way east. Some Super Rod encounters in this area:

!enc(13, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(3, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(479, ["Fishing"], ["Super"], "Seabound Cave / Evergreen Cave")

Enter the Evergreen Forest. 

!enc(470, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Rock Climb immediately above, then use Strength to get to the top. Here, you'll find an *Ice Memory* and have a chance to catch **Sneasel**! Next, towards the top of the area, surf across a pond, climb some rocks and use Strength again to pick up the *Audinite*! Finally, make your way to the spring. Battle and catch "The Emperor" (**Empoleon**). Back outside the forest, talk to Nana in her house for the *Crabominable Crest* and a *King's Rock*!

Head to North Evergreen Cave just outside. Melt the ice again with a move like Lava Plume to get to the top. Push the boulder into this hole. On the next floor, you need to push it into the rightmost hole... unfortunately this is the farthest one away. On the next floor, navigate it all the way around to the hole on the bottom. Once you push it down, follow it down.

!enc(491, ["Surfing", "Fishing"], nil, "Evergreen Cave (North) Basement")

Enter the Locksmith's house in Akuwa Town, to the left of the Pokemon Center. Show him our broken key. If you have 2 Light Clay and 1 Hard Stone, he'll make us a *Reforged Key*! Nice. Fly back to Sashila and enter the house on the coastline. Hidden on the first floor is a *Yellow Shard*, *Blue Shard*, and a *Red Shard*. Head upstairs and talk to the girl and pick up a hidden *Poke Doll*. Interact with the hook downstairs and place the Family Portrait that we got in the *Wall of Shame* quest. Then, head around to the left and go downstairs to get the *Gardevoirite*!

Head back to Akuwa and head south onto Route 4. 

!enc(115, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Next, we take a trip to the Lost Camp. If you have completed the *Lost Souls* quest up till this point by helping Mosely in the Hospital of Hope, you can now finally conclude this sidequest.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Finish Lost Souls (+999 Mosely)

Grab the *Kangaskhanite* to the left. Outside, the Lost Garden will be in its final form. You can pick *2 Custap Berries*, *3 Sitrus Berries*, a *Lum Berry*, and *2 Roseli Berries*. You'll also now be able to catch **Scorbunny**!

Now that we've beaten Souta, all four of the dens have been updated with new Pokemon! So, I will list the Pokemon in each here.

!raid(1, 12)

!raid(2, 12)

!raid(3, 12)

!raid(4, 12)

We're going to need to have 15000 Red Essence in our gather cube for a quest later on, so now is a great time to accumulate it.

Fly to Goldenleaf Town.

!enc(82, ["Fishing"], ["Super"], "Goldenleaf Town / Forgotten Path")

Enter Wispy Ruins through the statue. Head into the 4-way junction and go right, then, push the strength boulder onto the platform. Enter, and follow the path up. Step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 9: **Gastly**!

Head next to the Forgotten Path. Enter the Lost Castle and make your way straight to the back. If you've opened all 9 of Griselda's Treasures, you can open another chest to get the *Vespiquen Crest*, and *TM61 Will-O-Wisp*.

Next, go to the Wispy Path.

!enc(95, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(423, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(424, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(67, ["Fishing"], ["Super"], "Route 3 / Phasial Cave / Moon Field / Mirage Woods")

!enc(432, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Head to the Amethyst Cave. 

!enc(4, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Make your way to the Amethyst Grotto. Using Strength, get *TM22 Solarbeam* and a hidden *Ability Capsule*. Exit onto Route 2.

!enc(199, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Next, fly to Rose Theater and use the Time Splicer Stone.

!enc(236, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(240, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(106, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Head to Sheridan Village in the past, then cut down the pink sapling in front of the village. Make your way back to the present. Head over to Route 2. Just to the left of the waterfall, you'll find a Rift in space-time. Head on in; why not!

!enc(474, ["Grass", "Fishing", "Surfing"])

Grab the *Dusk Stone* and hidden *Rare Candy* and *Blue Shard*. 

**ZCell 125: Route Z (Nighttime Only)**

!img("zcell125.png")

In the top right corner, you can get *TM11 Sunny Day*. Pick up the *Grass Memory* in the center and talk to Eizen.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Respond "Flabebe" (+1 Eizen)
- Respond with anything else (-1 Eizen)

That's all we can do here for now, so return to normal Route 2.

## Terajuma Island 12 Badge Quests

Time to do some quests on Terajuma. Fly over to Kakori Village.

!enc(298, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Take the lift up to Mt. Terajuma. If you've picked up all three of the TMs for Hail, Sunny Day, and Rain Dance, show them to the guy in front of the Weather Institute to get the *Castform Crest* and *TM128 Weather Ball*. 

Talk to a man above in the Weather Institute if you have started the *Flora's Puzzle Box* Quest. He wants a Pumpkin from Goldenleaf Town, so fly over there. The pumpkin is on the hill across the river to the left... uh oh.

!boss("BOSSGOURGEIST", "Forest Field")

Quite a tough fight out of nowhere! Past its first phase, Gourgeist has a ton of ways to heal itself, so you have to find a way to either get clean one-shots, or suppress this healing. Transforming the field from Grassy Terrain into Swamp or Burning Field or Corrupted Field can be helpful. 

Winning awards you with the *Pumpkin*. Return to the Mt. Terajuma Weather Institute. You'll get the *Sceptilite* as well as *Venusaurite G*. 

Next, add three Pokemon to your party that match the types of Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus. Rookidee, Emolga, and Gligar fulfill this criteria. Fly to the Terajuma Shipyard.

!enc(207, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Enter the Terajuma Jungle.

!enc(210, ["Fishing"], ["Super"], "Terajuma Jungle / Deep Terajuma Jungle")

Head all the way to the Tyluric Temple.

!enc(179, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Proceed until you reach the indoor lava section, then go all the way to the right. Talk to the tablet here, then go up the stairs for a fight.

!boss("BOSSKECLEON", "Grassy Terrain")

This fight is easy to win, but that's not our entire objective. Talk to the board behind to see what it is: getting Kecleon to match the "Fourth Force". The fourth force in question is Enamorus, so defeat it while its typing is Fairy/Flying. Open the chest to get **Togepi**!

Back on the roof of the temple, sneak past the three cyclones at the top. You'll see **Grookey** that you can catch in exchange for a GourmetTreat.

Make sure you have 15000 Red Essence and a Rift Fragment, then fly to Helojak Island.

In the bottom right corner, you can push a boulder to reach a raid den. Throw in 15000 Red Essence and a Rift Fragment, and you'll be able to battle **Shadow Beldum**! This Pokemon is similar to that of other Raid Dens: it starts with 40 EVs and 20 IVs for all six stats, and has custom moves: Life Dew, Zap Cannon, Gravity, and Iron Head. You will also get *Xen Waste* for the capture.

Fly to Teila Resort and enter the Magrodar Crater. At night, you can push a floating Black Shard on the left to find Chimchar. Give it 12 Charcoal to catch **Chimchar**!

!enc(301, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(302, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(326, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Fly over to Kristiline Town next. The TM shop has updated wares:

!shop("Kristiline TMs (12+ Badges)", [["RM01 Hone Claws", 75000], ["RM05 Sucker Punch", 50000], ["TM116 Mega Kick", 75000], ["TM125 Charm", 15000], ["TM155 Eerie Impulse", 15000]])

Head to the Isle of Angels and enter the Tower of Theolia through the portal in the church. Enter the Tower Cellar and enter the crack in the wall to the left, follow the path out, and slide back into the central room. Slide your way to the room at the bottom. On the left you can push a boulder and smash a wall to get the one, the only. *TM13 Ice Beam*!!! Plus, 3 hidden *Exp. Candy XL*.

One quest remains for now. Fly over to Jynnobi Pass. 

!enc(299, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(173, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

Fly over to the Valor Shore.

!enc(139, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(300, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

The top left Xen Ship had trainers with too high levels before, but we can tackle it now.

!dbattle(["Sett",:XENGRUNT_M,0], ["Doris",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

!dbattle(["Soren",:XENMAGE_M,0], ["Misella",:XENMAGE_F,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Open these chests to get *3 Red Shards*, *3 Blue Shards*, *3 Yellow Shards*, *3 Green Shards*, *Fire Stone*, *Leaf Stone*, and *Thunderstone*.

!dbattle(["Darwin",:XENDEATHWING_M,0], ["Joan",:XENANALYST_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

A lot of crests at play, but shouldn't be too crazy at this point. In the chests beyond are *4 Exp. Candy XL*, *3 Black Prisms*, *Cherish Ball*, *Glitter Ball*, *Dream Ball*, *Protein*, *Carbos*, *Iron*, and the *Electrode Crest*!

We can also do some fishing on Terrial Island and in the Badlands with the Super Rod:

!enc(350, ["Fishing"], ["Super"])

!enc(357, ["Fishing"], ["Super"], "Darchlight Woods / Darchlight Village / Darchlight Manor")

## Grand Dream Tournament

When you're ready, hop on the Route 9 train headed to the Tournament Stadium. Enter the building. Talk to Erin at the desk, then to the attendant.

There is an *Ultra Potion* and *Revival Herb* here. Head in and talk to Erin.

The Inverse Field is the simplest Field in this game, with only a few effects to its name. Yet this fight is pretty difficult: despite their sturdiness, Rock types have a ton of weaknesses and few resistances normally, all of which is flipped in this battle. With tons of inverse-focused coverage in types like Grass, Normal, and Bug, your team is likely going to get caught off guard in this fight. He has a range of speeds on his team but nothing way too slow to pull off a Trick Room strategy, and he also has a Sash on Kabutops and similar effect on crested Rampardos. Stone Axe adds Stealth Rock to your side as well. His lead is tricky too: the Magical Seed transforms Tyranitar into a Normal type and adds Normalize.

Winning this fight will probably rely on a hazard to break the sash effects plus a sweeper. Fire and Normal moves are generally going to be your best bet here. Aerodactyl is fast but weak to moves like Quick Attack and Extremespeed, after all. 

Win to get the Rugged Badge, which lets us use Dive and go up to Level 85. You'll also get *TM80 Rock Slide*.
