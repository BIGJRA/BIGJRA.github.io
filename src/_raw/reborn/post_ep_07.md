# Postgame Episode 7: Up, Down, n' All Around

The level cap now sits at Lv. 135.

## Rhodochrine Tree (Part 1)

Accept Nyu's quest in the Nightclub, then fly over to Beryl Ward. Enter Rhodochrine Jungle and make your way to the large tree at the top. Talk to Lumi here and agree to fetch the food from the Spyce. Make your way to Spyce in the North Obsidia Ward, get the 6 *Bubble Teas* from the lady behind the counter, then return to the jungle.

Talk to Lumi outside once more, and you'll see a New World Door has opened. Great. Before we enter it though, head down to the Underroot. You'll find Shelly along with all of the following:

**ZCell 47: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_47.jpg")

**ZCell 48: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_48.jpg")

**ZCell 49: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_49.jpg")

**ZCell 50: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_50.jpg")

**ZCell 51: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_51.jpg")

**ZCell 52: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_52.jpg")

**ZCell 53: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_53.jpg")

**ZCell 54: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_54.jpg")

**ZCell 55: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_55.jpg")

**ZCell 56: The Underroot**

!img("zcell_56.jpg")

With those all taken care of, return to the Rhodochrine Tree and enter the New World Door.

The tree is another puzzle! Essentially, the goal will be to 'balance' the Anomalous (light) and Umbral (dark) energy in each room by knocking out Pokemon of each kind.

In the first room, knock out one of the Espeon to proceed.

Essentially, each species has a prime number 'value' among the first 8 primes - adding up the values for Anomalous and Umbral Pokemon in each room yet to be knocked out will tell you the current score - make them equal to continue. Note that you can't simply knock all of the Pokemon out - there must be at least one of each type still around.

In the second room, you'll be told Chingling is 2, Espeon is 3, and Mightyena is 5. By extension from the first floor, you'll be able to conclude Umbreon is 3.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Since Mightyena is the only Umbral Pokemon it must be kept alive: bringing the Anomalous total to 5 requires knocking out one Chingling.

</div>

In the third room, the Anomalous total is 7, and the Umbral total is 10. Eve will tell us Togetic is 7 before having to flee, so Noel will join us as we proceed.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    To bring the Umbral total down to 7, knocking out Umbreon is the way. Note that this implies that Mismagius is worth 7.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

In the fourth room, the totals are 12 and 14, respectively.  There are two Mismagius, a Togetic, a Cleffa, and an Espeon in this room.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    The solution: Since we know the values of Togetic and Espeon, we can conclude Cleffa is 2. We know that we will need to knock out at least one Umbral Pokemon but not both... so knocking out one Mismagius leads to an Umbral total of 7. To the Anomalous total down from 12, then, we'll need to knock out Cleffa and Espeon.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The fifth room has totals of 10 and 9, respectively. There are three Umbreon here, as well as one each of Flabebe, Floette, and Florges. We aren't directly given the values of any of these three, however.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Since the three Anomalous Pokemon have prime values, the only way to make 10 from three primes is by adding 2, 3, and 5. The game doesn't really tell you this until after this puzzle, but within evolutionary lines the further along species has the higher values - so Flabebe is 2, Floette is 3, and Florges is 5. With that information, we know we will need to knock out either one or two Umbreons to make an Umbral total of 3 or 6... but the latter cannot be obtained by any sum of 2, 3, and 5. So, knock out two Umbreon, Flabebe, and Florges to reach a balance of 3.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The sixth room has totals of 30 and 26. On the Anomalous side, you'll notice 2 Floette, 1 Florges, 1 Chingling, 2 Espeon, and 1 Granbull. On the Umbral side, you'll notice 2 Zweilous.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Since we have 2 Zweilous and an Umbral total of 26, we can conclude Zweilous is 13. By subtracting one 2, four 3's, and one 5 from 30, we can conclude that Granbull is 11. Since we can't simply remove 4 from the Anomalous side to reach 26, we'll need to knock out one Zweilous, making the target 13. As for the Anomalous side, knocking out Granbull and both Floettes will reach the balance of 13.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The seventh room has 24 and 21. There is 1 Spritzee and 2 Kadabra in here, as well as 1 Houndour, 1 Murkrow, and 1 Zweilous.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    First, we can figure out the values. Note that the Anomalous total is even, and the 2 Kadabra together will always have an even total. This implies Spritzee is even, since it is a prime, Spritzee is 2. We can thus conclude Kadabra is 11. On the other side, Murkrow and Houndour together add up to 8, meaning one of them must be 3 and the other 5. Shelving this for now, we now look at all the possible states of the Anomalous side. Keeping 2/3 alive would result in a total of either 13 or 22, while keeping only 1/3 alive would result in a total of either 2 or 11. None of the Umbral Pokemon are valued 2 or 11, and the Dark total begins at 21, meaning 13 must be the target value - knocking out one Kadabra will get us there on the Anomalous side. Luckily for us, Zweilous is valued 13, so we can knock out Houndour and Murkrow without being sure of their values to finish this room.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The eighth room has 18 and 24. The Anomalous Pokemon are 1 Granbull and 1 Togetic, and the Umbral Pokemon are 1 Houndour, 1 Drifloon, and 1 Mandibuzz.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    First, we will try to figure out what we can learn about the values of the Umbral Pokemon. If Houndour is 3, then Drifloon and Mandibuzz will total 21. Two odd numbers can't sum to an odd number, so one of them must be 2, meaning the other would be 19. If instead Houndour is 5, then Drifloon and Mandibuzz would total 19; by similar logic, would then be 2 and 17. We know that we will need to target either 7 or 11 thanks to the Anomalous side only having 2 Pokemon. So, how can we total 7 or 11 in the first case, where the Umbral values are 2, 3, 19? Well, we can't - one knockout would mean a total 5, 21, or 22. In the second case, however, the Umbral values being 2, 5, 17 would mean we simply have to knock out the 17 - since a solution exists, we can conclude Houndour is 5. We still aren't told whether Drifloon is 2 or 17, but later puzzles reveal that we can assume all evolutionary line members should be assumed to exist, even if they aren't present - meaning we can assume Vullaby exists, so Mandibuzz can't be the lowest prime in 2. So Drifloon is 2 and Mandibuzz is 17, and knocking out Mandibuzz and Granbull is all you need to do.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The ninth room has 20 and 31. The Anomalous Pokemon are 1 Clefable and 1 Chimecho, while the Umbral Pokemon are 1 Poochyena, 1 Eevee, 1 Vullaby, 3 Deino, 1 Hydreigon, and 1 Misdreavus. We are also finally actually told that evolutions increase in value.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    This one is thankfully easier than it seems - since we know Zweilous is 13, Hydreigon must thus be 17 or 19. There are 7 non Hydreigon Umbral Pokemon. If Hydreigon is 19, then the remaining value is 12... which is not enough for the remaning 7 that all have a minimum of 2. It IS enough when Hydreigon is 17, however, meaning all of the other Umbral Pokemon are 2. So, that's nice. As for the Anomalous two, we know they total 20, hence must be 7 and 13 or 3 and 17. We can't generate 7 or 13 on the Umbral Side, so Chimecho and Clefable are 3 and 17. Since Cleffa is 2, we can infer the existence of Clefairy who must be at least 3. So Clefable isn't 3 and must thus be 17! Knocking out everything except Hydreigon and Clefable does the trick.

</div>

With that, we finally reach the top of the tree!

!enc(889)

Go to the left all the way to what appears like a dead end, and you'll be able to get:

**ZCell 57: Rhodochrine Tree**

!img("zcell_57.jpg")

You can also surf across the water on the right side of the area to reach:

**ZCell 58: Rhodochrine Tree**

!img("zcell_58.jpg")

Talk to Noel once more and you'll be taken to the base of the tree. That's it for this quest right now: we'll finish it up later. Return to the Nightclub!

## Mirage Tower Mirages

Accept the quest from Aster, then fly over to Train Town in the desert. Take the portal to the Mirage Tower.

Talk to Laura in the first room. We'll get a choice on going higher in the tower to find Charlotte and lower to find Saphira - we'll be able to do both, though. I'll start by going up. Follow the path through the Mirage Tower the same way as before. When you reach the room that contained Honedge, enter the New World Door.

In this section, more of the same kind of puzzle we did previously in the tower. Only now you can touch the puzzles on both sides. Here I will say the left puzzle is "P1" and the right puzzle is "P2" for notation.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    P1: U L3 P2: U2 R3 U2 D2 L5 R2 D2, P1: R D

  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to the second puzzle</a>
</div>

The third puzzle has a secret. See if you can figure it out.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    The secret is that you can take pieces out of the inscribed squares... anywhere on the map. Anyways, one possible solution: <br/>
    P2: R2, P1: L2, P2: U2, P1: L2 U2, P2: L2 U R2 U2 L D8 R5 U4 L2 D, P1: D3 R6 L4 D2 L2, P2: D2
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to the third puzzle</a>
</div>

In the next room, you can talk to Charlotte on Lin Route:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- On Lin Route, Tell Charlotte her line was badass (+1 Charlotte)

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    P1: D2 L2, P2: U2, P1: R2, P2: D2, P1: U
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to the fourth puzzle</a>
</div>

Once you finish the puzzle, you can grab:

**ZCell 59: Mirage Tower?**

!img("zcell_59.jpg")

You can also get the *Solganium-Z* here. Proceed to the next room.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    P1: D3 R D R3 U L4, P2: U4 R3, P1: L U R2, P2: U L D L D, P1: R, P2: D2 L, P1: D
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to the fifth puzzle</a>
</div>

Once you succeed, you'll get the *Latiasite* and *Latiosite*! Nice. However, there's still more to do: return to the previous room.

You can walk up past the New World Door, finding another New World Door at the very top. In the next room is an Anomaly!

!battle(["Ho-oh", :HOOH, 0], "Mirror Arena")

If the field is broken, you'll go to New World... where all the Magical Seeds and many of your opponents moves will be activated. The team is all Flying or Dragon type, so make sure you can exploit those two weaknesses with some sweepers to win.

Afterwards, you'll be able to catch **Ho-oh**, who is holding a *Sacred Ash*! Accept the fast travel request to the entrance to the Mirage Tower. Next, break all of the mirrors on this floor to open a bath to Mirage Tower B1F.

You'll find a New World Door to the left, so head on in. Talk to Saphira, then head down the ladder. At the end of the path is a mirror. Smashing it will take you to a different dimension of sorts. Push the stone up, then un-smash the mirror - the ladder has moved! Take it to proceed.

In the next area, head down the ladder to get a hidden *Rare Bone*. Head up the ladder, then smash the mirror to enter the crystal dimension. Head through the New World Door at the bottom to get:

**ZCell 60: Mirage Tower?**

!img("zcell_60.jpg")

Complete the rest of the room: using what we've just learned will make it straightforward. Push the stone in a clockwise loop around the room to continuously push the ladder.

The next section is generally similar, note that you can access the mirror from upper levels and lower levels. On the left side of the loop, you'll be able to push the stone into a rectangle - if you can get it into the bottom left corner, the ladder will take you onto the rock to the *Lunalium-Z* as well as:

**ZCell 61: Mirage Tower?**

!img("zcell_61.jpg")

Make it to the end of the room and exit at the top. You'll talk to Saphira here, and also you'll be able to find:

**ZCell 62: Mirage Tower?**

!img("zcell_62.jpg")

Exiting from here does send you back to the beginning, but Saphira has made returning pretty simple as she has gotten rid of the webs. The dead end isn't a real dead end - if you return to the crystal dimension just before the final portal, pushing the stone to the bottom left corner will allow you to access another path across some water. Follow this path to another Anomaly!

!battle(["Lugia", :LUGIA, 0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Been a while since we've had to fight on this terrain, but you can surely handle it. Be careful of Kommo-o with it's Z-Move and the very bulky Lugia.

Win, and you can catch **Lugia**! Accept the fast travel back up, watch the conversation, then head back to the Nightclub.

## New World Crash (Part 1)

Accept Simon's quest, then fly over to the Beryl Ward. Cross the bridge and enter Citrine Mountain. Make your way to the bottom right corner of the room, then climb up the rocks and surf to the waterfall in the top right corner. Enter the New World Door.

After the conversation in the middle, follow the narrow paths to the corners of the area and talk to the small rocks. Once you've done all four, go to the top of the area for an Anomaly battle!

!battle(["Deoxys", :DEOXYS, 0], "Starlight Arena")

Nothing too crazy here, I guess. Deoxys Defense is probably the most threatening - if it can set up defenses AND offenses, you're going to have a bad time. Abuse Dark type moves being buffed on this field to one shot it if you need to.

Once you win, you can catch **Deoxys**! 

Head back to the nightclub.

## Cauldron of the Future

Accept Sandy's quest next, then make your way through the desert all the way to Teknite Cave. Make your way to the [Teknite Ridge](#teknite-cave--teknite-ridge) via going left at the fork in the cave. Climb the rocks at the top to reach a New World Door! Enter it.

!enc(876)

Pretty sweet - we can catch Celesteela now, as well as Cosmog. Fish in the void lake near Adrienn to get some! Grab two of them (four for the living dex) to also obtain **Cosmoem**, **Solgaleo**, and **Lunala** by evolving at Lv. 43, 53 during the day, and 53 during the night, respectively. You can also get another Type: Null here for living dex purposes if you like.

Follow the path to the left to find:

**ZCell 63: Cauldron of the Future**

!img("zcell_63.jpg")

It's also worth noting that the glowing mining rocks here will infinitely replenish if you exit this area and return, so no need to buy Blast Powder or worry about the finite number of rocks in the region.

Talk to Adrienn - there are no mandatory battles in this section. A refreshing break!

Once you're done here, return to the Nightclub.

## Umbral Battles in Aegir Cave (Part 1)

Accept your gang leader's quest next. Return to the desert and make your way to the [Sugiline Cave](#sugiline-cave). Make your way to the back via the Garchomp Statue maze. Enter the New World Door just to the right of the top of the room!

!enc(883, nil, nil, "New World (Sugiline Cave)")

Follow the path to the New World Door in the water. Head down from here to the island in the middle of the Aegir Cave lake.

!battle(["Amaria", :UMBAMARIA, 0], "Water Surface")

The fight will go instantly to Grassy Terrain for a little while. As long as you have a few Specially Defensive and fast Pokemon, letting Celesteela hang around while you attack the other, faster Pokemon on the field can be a good idea. Changing the field to Corrosive Field can be useful for gaining momentum.

!battle(["Titania", :UMBTITANIA, 0], "Cave Field")

Another pretty tough one. Diamond Storm and Power Gem both turn the field to the Crystal Cavern Field, so watch out for that. A couple Steel leads might be ideal to start here - speed and/or Bullet Punch can help them OHKO Diancie. The rest of the team is generally weak to some combination of Ground and Fighting type moves barring Marshadow - who has priority, a Z-Move, and Spectral Thief to ruin your set ups. Take advantage of Regigigas being a sort of underwhelming support set to take out the threats if you need to.

Once you win against both Umbral opponents, talk to Florinia.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Tell Florinia you understand your next objective (+1 Florinia)

Florinia will tell us that we need to catch Rayquaza in order to fix the issues here. We will do so, but later on. That's it for this quest for now, so make your way back to the Nightclub.

## New World Helix

Finally, accept Smeargle's quest. Head over to Apophyll Cave and make your way to 2F. Enter the New World Door!

!enc(887)

Depending on your story decisions thus far, you'll see Taka or Zero above, who will join you for this quest.

Switching between us and them with the "A" key, you'll need to progress with each character to get the other to proceed. To succeed:

- As the Ex-Meteor (XM), activate the orb by going down.
- As the main character (MC), head up and activate a crystal by going clockwise.
- XM: Go up as far as you can and talk to Abomasnow and use Snow Warning.
- MC: Continue along the path, past the snowdrift.
- XM: Go all the way down counter-clockwise, until you reach the orb you can't do anything with.
- MC: Talk to Altaria and use Cloud Nine.
- XM: Activate the orb.
- MC: Cross the ice to the right and activate the orb. Cross back left, talk to Abomasnow on the ice, then go back down and right. Use the crystal.
- XM: Go all the way back up and follow the path clockwise. Use the crystal.
- MC: Climb down the icy stairs. Talk to Altaria, then talk to the orb. Go down into the ice puzzle here and talk to Abomasnow.
- XM: Go down from here. Activate the crystal, then go down past the snowdrift.
- MC: Starting underneath Abomasnow, using the patch in the ice to the left, head down. Stand near the frozen orb.
- XM: Talk to Altaria.
- MC: Use the orb.
- XM: Go to the left. Activate the crystal.
- MC: Head back up to the ice maze and talk to Abomasnow. Head back down.
- XM: Go up and left, and climb down the snowdrift.
- MC: Talk to Altaria.
- XM: Use the orb, activate the crystal beyond, then use the second orb beyond. Head back to the ice puzzle and talk to Abomasnow.
- MC: Go left/clockwise and head up the snow drift, talk to Altaria, and follow the path to activate another orb.
- XM: Talk to Abomasnow, then follow the path right/clockwise to the next frozen orb.
- MC: Backtrack to the nearest Altaria and talk to it.
- XM: Use the orb, then talk to Abomasnow.
- MC: Follow the path all the way to the nine gemstones.
- XM: Make your way to the nine gemstones.

You'll need to transform the gemstones near MC black, and the ones near XM white. Each gemstone also changes the ones immediately around it. It shouldn't be too hard with some trial and error. Head up from here and go through the door.

You'll have a partner here: if Taka is dead and we're with Zero:

!partner(["Zero", :ZEL3, 0])

If we're with Taka and he has both eyes:

!partner(["Taka", :Taka2, 1])

If we're with Taka and he only has one eye:

!partner(["Taka", :ZTAKA2, 0])

!dbattle(["Zekrom", :ZEKROM, 0], ["Reshiram", :RESHIRAM, 0], "Icy Field")

This first fight can be fairly tough - this field pushes the Icy Field to its limit. With Aurora Veil, your opponents will likely be able to stick around while they build up speed from priority attacks. Mega Kangaskhan can use Fake Out and Power Up Punch to reach +2 in Atk and Spe, so be wary when it comes out. Generally, the team is weak to Rock, Ground, and Ice moves, so try to use those if you can.

!dbattle(["Kyurem", :KYUREM1, 0], ["Fusion Simulations", :KYUREM2, 0], "New World")

Although you do get healed, you'll be thrust into a second Double battle. While it's hard to rely on your ally acting in your favor, Taka does sometimes use Tailwind, which can help out. All but Magearna and Mew are weak to either Rock or Fairy moves, so Rock Slide and especially field-boosted Dazzling Gleam may be very helpful here.

Once you win, three doors will open. Inside each, you can catch **Reshiram**, **Zekrom**, and **Kyurem**! Once you catch the third, prepare your team before you head back out.

!battle(["Ace", :UMBACE, 0], "New World")

Nothing too crazy for this point in the game, but still a formidable challenge. Boosted Dark and Fairy moves will make it easier.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Umbral Ace while Taka is partnered with you, Reshiram Route only (+1 Ace)

Accept the fast travel request once you're done!

In the Nightclub, you can show Ace the Fennekin (or Braixen, Delphox) that we obtained back in the Water Treatment Center, if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Show Ace the WTC Fennekin (+1 Ace)

Talking to them again, you can get a *Red Card*.

## New World Crash (Part 2)

Oh yeah, surprise level cap increase to Lv. 140. Talk to Zero to get the next quest. We need to return to the New World Crash via the door in Citrine Mountain, so make your way back there.

Talk to the woman in front of the meteor for a fight.

!battle(["Zina", :ZINA, 0], "Starlight Arena")

Nothing too crazy, but you will notice that we really are in the endgame now as we're up against 3 Ubers casually sprinkled into this team.

Once you win, we'll get our next destination: the Byxbysion Wasteland.

## Distorted Space

Fly over to Byxbysion and make your way into the tunnels. In the room with the branches, enter the second entrance when you're ready.

!battle(["Naganadel", :NAGANADEL, 0], "Wasteland")

This is pretty brutal for a singles fight. For one, the team is entirely resistant to basically any way that you would want to try to use the field for your own gain due to Steel and Poison typings. With the field preventing hazard set up and an extremely strong Mega Lucario Bullet Punch to prevent any clever Trick Room sweeping, many of the usually good strategies are busted here. Earth Power, Drill Run, and High Horsepower are all Ground type options that aren't weakened by this field if you want to try them.

Once you win, enter the New World Door to reach Distorted Space.

Defeat the Malamar here. Afterwards, talking to any Malamar will switch which sections of path are walkable and which are not. A path through, with color changes indicating use of Malamar, is as follows:

!img("distorted_space_1.jpg")

The second room introduces a new wrinkle - the space bending statues we used in the Dialga/Palkia quest are back, and used in conjunction with the Malamar. Before continuing, talk to the first accessible Malamar, then walk back through the portal to the previous room. Use the statue to go left to grab the *Marshadium-Z*! Anyways, the path through the second room is as follows:

!img("distorted_space_2.jpg")

Note that once you reach the gold stars the second time, you'll need to talk to Malamar while you still have your walk-through-walls ability from the upper statue, then head right back up to these two statues to continue.

In the next room, we first will need to interact with the two orbs towards the bottom of the map. Once you do, you'll use statues and Malamar to return to the entrance to this room, ready to go again.

To reach the left orb, follow this path:

!img("distorted_space_3.jpg")

To reach the right orb, follow this path, noting that at the Blue Star, you'll need to talk to Malamar then press 'A' to return to the previous statue:

!img("distorted_space_4.jpg")

With that taken care of, use the only available statue to reach the center of the middle section above. Grab the *Lustrous Orb*, *Adamant Orb*, as well as:

**ZCell 64: Distorted Space**

!img("zcell_64.jpg")

This final puzzle in here is a bit more complicated. If Taka is alive and has both of his eyes (Anna Route & Lin Reshiram Route having defeated Garchomp) this puzzle will basically be solved for you automatically, so I'll show the full solution for Lin Route here. First, use the statue to reach Malamar, then make your way back to the center. We can solve this puzzle entirely without having to use Malamar again after this (to be sure you're on the right one, make sure the left Giratina statue is activated).

Anyways, at any instant you have three actions that you can take - press the left column, press the right column, and press the center. There are five colors in play: White (W), Light Gray (L), Gray (G), Dark Gray (D), and Black (B). When you press the left column, the five tiles in the column will shift cyclically. To reach the left column, you'll need to use the statue to walk through walls. The right column works similarly, though you won't have to do any phasing.

Talking to the center is a bit more complex: when you talk to the center, it will pull the top block from each of the columns and combine them to make a composite color. W + G = L, for example, and W + B = G. In cases where there is an odd number of 'gaps', it will favor the extreme, so W + L = W, and W + D = L. It will also shift the current five blocks in the center downward, and split the bottom-most block into two components, which will go to the bottom of the left and right columns respectively. To win, you'll need to fill the center column with, bottom to top, B, D, G, L, W blocks.

Figuring out what is going on might be harder than doing the puzzle itself, which you can kinda brute force. Honestly, I recommend spending a minute or two just randomly pressing the center and each column until you have a big mess of different colors all over the puzzle. Then, use the two columns to pull blocks that will generate B into the top - either B + B or B + D will work. Next, pull in blocks that will generate D, then G, L, and finally W. If at any point you are unable to create the desired block, simply continuously press the center 9 times and mess with the columns some more until you're able to. Head through the door when you're ready!

We actually only have to fight the following battle on Lin Route, as on Anna Route Taka will take care of it:

!battle(["Giratina", :GIRATINA, 0], "Inverse Field")

Inverse Field! Probably weren't expecting this, were you? Might as well go all in on the 'new' type matchups for this one - Fighting is a great choice for Lugia and Yveltal, and Psychic can take the Ice types and Yveltal as well. Fake out and/or hazards are good choices for the Sashes. Using Psych Up or Haze may be useful for the enemy Magical Seeds, or you can just abuse your own.

Catch **Giratina** next.

If you're on Anna Route, you'll need to reset the game a few times through some deceptive "Bad End" screens to proceed. Anyways, return to the Nightclub to really begin wrapping up the postgame!
