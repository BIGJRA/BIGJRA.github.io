# Episode 3: Domino

Exit Florinia's Arena. There are a few things we can do now that we have 2 badges before we continue the story.

## 2 Badge Quests

First, head to the room containing the nurse in the Trainer School. A girl towards the left side will trade you battle advice for *TM100 Confide*!

Now that we have 2 badges, the Pokemarts and candy store have updated inventory now:

!shop("Default Mart (2-5 Badges)", ["Super Potion", "Antidote", "Paralyze Heal", "Burn Heal", "Escape Rope", "Super Repel", "Poke Ball"])

!shop("Sweet Kiss (Bottom) (2-3 Badges)", ["Common Candy", ["Exp. Candy XS", 500], ["Exp. Candy S", 2000], "Rare Candy"])

Head into the Obsidia Slums. Nearby where we first entered on the first floor, you'll see a doctor talking to a child. Talk to him to get the *Itemfinder*! Note that this is a limited time event, so if you don't want to have to wait until we get four more badges to get the Itemfinder, act now! Since I assume you can use the itemfinder now, going forward in this guide, I will not describe exact locations of hidden items. You'll also find an *Exp. Candy M* here.

Head left and take the elevator down to B1F. Immediately head left and go up, following the path. If you have snax in your bag, you can catch **Makuhita**!

Back in Opal Ward, specifically if you randomly got Clamperl earlier in Onyx Ward, a person near the water at the bottom will give you a *Deep Sea Tooth* or a *Deep Sea Scale*, randomly determined.

There is also a new trainer on the Opal Bridge:

!battle(["Bart", :YOUNGSTER, 0])

Finally, head to the apartment in the top left corner of Peridot Ward. Now that we have two badges we can finally take home **Snubbull** or **Stufful**, randomly determined.

## Jasper Ward & Malchous Forest Park

Leave this house, and head into the Jasper gate to your right. Talk to the guard here and head into Jasper Ward.

!enc(130)

It's worth noting that when we have like 11 more badges we will eventually want a Carnivine for an in-game trade.

Talk to Corey and Heather here, then head into the police station. Talk to the chief here, who will tell you about his missing officers. You don't have to find them, but doing so is the first step to doing the more exclusive postgame story route. If you'd like to play the route of the game that involves not finding the officers in time, you can skip finding one of the officers until you complete up to the end of this section, then find them afterwards to get the quest rewards.

In general, I will mention story splits and how choices affect post-game route availability just so you can keep your options open.

Outside, you'll find a Meteor Grunt to the right.

!battle(["Simon", :MeteorGrunt, 1])

To the left, grab a hidden *Super Potion*. At night only, you can fight a cop.

!battle(["Joe", :PoliceOfficer, 0])

Enter the building here.

!battle(["Ross", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

!battle(["Morrison", :StreetRat, 0])

Exit through the top right, where you'll find a Pokemon Center as well as a hidden *Antidote* and *Ether*. During a clear morning or day, you can talk to an **Emolga** to battle and catch it.

Head back down into the building below the Pokemon Center and exit to the left. Pick up a hidden *Pecha Berry* and continue into the next building.

!battle(["Tara", :MeteorGrunt_090, 1])

Head outside at the bottom.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes (+1 Heather)
- No (-1 Heather)

Head to the left into the Forest Park.

!enc(132)

Head towards the center of the area, and chop the wiggly tree nearby. Following the path that this opens up below, you can grab hidden *X Speed*, *Full Heal*, and *Telluric Seed*. Chop the wiggly tree to the right nearby and receive a *Super Potion* from Heather, then chop the wiggly tree immediately to the left.

From here, backtrack to the entrance of the forest. Go up and left, choosing to go left instead of climbing the two-tile wide set of stairs. Follow this path up and climb three sets of stairs: you'll see a Meteor Grunt here.

!battle(["Ringo", :MeteorGrunt, 1], "Forest Field")

Chop down the wiggly tree here. Down just one set of stairs, you can now head left to find another grunt.

!battle(["Rod", :MeteorGrunt, 1], "Forest Field")

Down from here you'll find some stairs leading to some grunts - but there is a secret passageway hidden to the left behind a tree. Follow this path to get a hidden *Revive* and *Exp. Candy S* as well as an egg. When it hatches it will be **Deerling**, **Skiddo**, **Girafarig**, or **Nincada**, randomly determined. Head back from here and fight the grunts.

!dbattle(["Regina", :MeteorGrunt_090, 0], ["Gretchen", :MeteorGrunt_090, 0], "Forest Field")

Go right and down from here. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and the *PULSE Readout 5B*.

Head back up, talk to Heather for a heal, then climb the vines on the nearby pillar, hop over to the main building, and head in. Jump on down. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and *Exp. Candy M* (missable if you don't grab them right now). Head up for a battle.

!battle(["Taka", :Taka, 0], "Rocky Field")

Taka will fight you on the Rocky Field. We don't have the notes for this field yet, but you will observe that Rock Tomb will be stronger here. The Telluric Seed can be helpful here: by testing it you'll notice that it raises Defense but does Stealth Rock damage. Since Exeggcute doesn't hit that hard you can take the chance to set up offenses on it, then you can hit the slow PULSE Tangrowth hard. Also, this entire team is weak to Ice.

After the battle, you'll be sent outside. Answer Corey how you like here, then grab hidden *X Defend* and *Green Shard* as well as a *Big Root*.

Exit Malchous Forest Park in the top right corner. In the first house, you'll find a grunt.

!battle(["Ray", :MeteorGrunt, 1])

Defeat him to free Police Officer #1. In the building next door, head up to 5F via the elevator, and talk to the girl inside so she'll leave.

Head back to the main part of Jasper via the bottom right exit of Malchous. On your way back to the Pokemon Center area, you can now grab a hidden *PokeSnax*.

Past the Pokemon Center, enter the first building you see. Talk to the guy here to activate a quest. You can also enter the elevator room here to get the *Forest Field Readout*.

Outside, you can now grab a *Paralyze Heal* and save Police Officer #2. Grab a hidden *Super Potion* and *Green Shard* outside and head into the small building here. If you have snax and talked to the panicking guy earlier, you can get **Mareep**!

Before we continue into the next ward, there's a quick thing we can do. Exit Jasper Ward to the south (there's a shortcut below the Mareep building) and head to the right. Enter the first house you see in Peridot Ward, and talk to the girls inside for *Department Store Sticker: Tangela* as well as *TM88 Sleep Talk*.

!shop("Department Store 3F (Left)", ["Sticky Barb", "Lagging Tail", "Iron Ball", "Binding Band", "Float Stone", "Eject Button", "Red Card", "Ring Target", "Metronome"])

!shop("Department Store 3F (Right)", ["Heat Rock", "Icy Rock", "Smooth Rock", "Damp Rock", "Grip Claw", "Light Clay", "Everstone"])

Since money is still tight, I wouldn't recommend binging too many of these items for now, especially since most of them suck. We'll be able to get tons of the weather extending rocks, Iron Ball, and Light Clay after the next badge for free, but if your strategy involves weather or screens they are pretty cheap right now so it might be worth it for those.

Back in Jasper, return to the top-right corner and head up to access the next ward.

## Rhodochrine Jungle & The Underroot

Enter the Beryl Ward. We can't really explore much of this ward itself right now. Head to the right to access the Beryl Bridge. Hidden on the bridge you'll find a *Heart Scale*, *X Speed*, and *PokeSnax*.

While it is windy, at the end of the bridge you can catch **Drifloon**! Talk to the kid here and he will go home.

Back in Beryl, head left.

!enc(149)

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* outside, then an *X Attack* in the house. Make your way left, grab the hidden *Poke Ball*, and enter the jungle.

!enc(150)

Catch a Ledian for an in-game trade later, and a Farfetch'd to trade for a fossil later on as well.

Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* here, then head up and get a hidden *Rawst Berry* and *Rare Candy*, being careful to avoid stepping on the suspicious patch of grass. Head down and to the left, you'll see Meteor Grunts. You'll actually have a choice now on how to proceed - you can either step on the suspicious patch of grass or step on tall grass near the grunts to end up in a trap, or carefully sneak around the grunts and head up.

The jungle is huge, so I explain the results of this choice first, guide both routes to the same location, then explore the jungle after this convergence.

### Cage Trap Route

If you were trapped in a cage, read on, otherwise, [jump to the next section](#snuck-around-route).

Roughly, you'll want to follow the blue path in the following image:

!img("cagepath.png")

You'll wake up in a cage and Fern will taunt you here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Reject begging Fern (-1 Fern)
- Beg Fern once, then reject him (Neutral)
- Beg Fern twice, then reject him (+1 Fern)
- Beg Fern three times, then reject him (+2 Fern)
- Beg Fern four times (+5 Fern)

If you do reject him, eventually you will be let out anyways.

Head up and to the right to free Cain from his cage.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Freed Cain from the cage (+1 Cain)

Head down from here and talk to the lever. Heather will show up and pull the switch to activate these bridges.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Got stuck in a cage (-1 Heather)

Head east from here, and go slightly south once you reach a Meteor Grunt. Continue south until you hit a Gentleman, then go straight east and follow the path up the hill via stairs. The house here is a healing house, should you need it.

### Snuck Around Route

If you managed to carefully sneak around the grunts, read on, otherwise [jump to the next section](#exploring-the-jungle).

Head up the stairs on the right, and you'll find Fern.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talked to Fern atop the hill (+1 Fern)

The building to your right is a healing house, should you need it.

### Exploring the Jungle

All players following along should now be in the same place: next to the healing house.

!img("rhodo1.png")

Itemfind here for an *Exp. Candy S* then head down the hill, pick up hidden *Full Heal* and go down from here. The grunts around the fire will be gone now, so you can pick up a hidden *Guard Spec* to the west.

!img("rhodo2.png")

Head back up and go left. Here you'll see a gentleman.

!battle(["Ben", :GENTLEMAN, 0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Coleman", :MeteorGrunt, 1], "Forest Field")

In this area you can find a hidden *Liechi Berry* and *Great Ball*. To the right of the grunt, climb the hill and chop a wiggly tree.

!img("rhodo3.png")

Head back down the hill after the scene and go to the left.

!battle(["Kenneth", :MeteorGrunt, 0], "Forest Field")

On this next hill you can obtain a hidden *X Speed*. Climbing stairs to the northeast will lead to a hidden *Antidote*. We'll get to the cave entrance at the top of this area later, for now, sneak around the building in the bottom left and pick up a hidden *Dark Gem*. You can actually enter the felled building to the right, inside you'll find *TM77 Psych Up*.

!img("rhodo4.png")

Back outside, head up the ramp to the left and pick up the hidden *Green Shard*. Cross the wooden bridge to the left and head up. Here you can find a hidden *Salac Berry*, *Paralyze Heal*, and an *Antidote*. Head back down the stairs but this time follow the narrow path up and to the right. You'll cross a bridge over land here, grab a hidden *Blue Shard* and carefully pick up the *PULSE Readout 5A* without stepping on the shifty 2-by-2 patch of land. *After* you grab the readout, step on the trap.

This brings us to the Underroot - but we will explore this area fully in a little bit. For now, grab the hidden *Exp. Candy S* in a rock to the right, jump down the ledge and take the stairs here to return to a familiar part of the jungle.

Our next move is going to be to head all the way back to the healing house from earlier by going down, right at the gentleman, then up the hill to the right. Heal if you'd like.

!img("rhodo5.png")

Go straight down from here and follow the path across the bridge.

!battle(["Mary", :MeteorGrunt_090, 1], "Forest Field")

Grab a hidden *Blue Shard* as you make your way left. Head up as soon as you can, here is a Light Shard and a building. Inside, you'll find a PC as well as a in-game trade: your Sunkern for either **Carbink**, **Mime Jr.**, **Cryogonal**, or **Furfrou**, determined randomly. Perhaps more importantly, it will be holding the *Exp. Share*!

!img("rhodo6.png")

Head outside and follow the path left. You'll find a hidden *Red Shard*. At the next fork, go up, where you'll find a hidden *Super Potion* and a *Telluric Seed*. Take the other path of the fork now.

!battle(["Endow", :PkMnRANGER_Male, 0], "Forest Field")

You'll find a hidden *Calcium* here. Head to the left across the bridge and pick up an *Exp. Candy M*. Specifically on sunny days, you can battle and catch **Tropius** here as well. It's very strong for this point in the game, so be careful.

Head back across the bridge, and from here go down to find a hidden *Purple Shard* and a *Great Ball*. That pretty much covers the part of the jungle we have been able to access for now, so it's time to explore the Underroot. Nearby you'll see a trap spot on the ground, step on it to fall in.

### Exploring the Underroot

Hidden here is an *Exp. Candy S*. We can't do anything with these glowy rocks for a while, so head out of this area.

!enc(153, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

Head to the right first. You'll find a hidden *Chesto Berry* here. Take the nearby stairs to reach a new area of the jungle. You can find a hidden *Red Shard* and *Exp. Candy S* here. You can also battle and catch **Taillow** at the top.

Back in the Underroot, take the path up from here and cut the wiggly tree. Take the nearby stairs to access another section of jungle. Go up here to find a hidden *Ether* and **Stantler**.

Follow the path all the way down and to the right. Inside a house here is a lady. She will tutor us a pretty good move... but only if you have a Grass type starter. Since Grass type starters kinda suck compared to Fire type and Water type starters, here's a bit of compensation.

!tutor("Rhodochrine Move Tutor (Grass-type Starter Only)", [["Giga Drain", "Free"]])

Before we leave this section of jungle, there is a broken building with some lights on to the left.

!battle(["Bruno", :MeteorGrunt, 1], "Forest Field")

Defeat him to free Police Officer #3.

Back in the Underroot, go up and grab a hidden *Purple Shard*. To the left you'll find a hidden *Exp. Candy S* and a stationary **Seviper**.

Up and to the right you can get a hidden *Energy Root* and *Red Shard*, and free Police Officer #4. Head down and pass under the waterfall to the right. Head right for a hidden *Dire Hit* and *Poke Ball*. Back left from here, head up. This was an area we visited earlier - you can access the main part of the jungle via these stairs.

Still in the Underroot, head down from here and take the stairs downward on the east side of the waterfall. Hug the left wall as you go down. You'll find a *Potion*, *Blue Shard*, *Energy Powder*, *Heavy Ball*, and an *Elemental Seed* on the ground. Use the Light Shard if you need it and head back up.

At the first fork, now go to the right. Grab a hidden *Oran Berry* and a *Hyper Potion* on the ground. Back up from here, take a right at the next fork.

Go to the right when you can, get a hidden *Ice Heal*, and continue right to emerge into the jungle once more.

### Finishing Up in the Jungle

Head out and to the right, and you'll actually pop out in Beryl Ward. There is a hidden *Super Potion* and a *PP Up* here. Head into this library.

You can walk on the tops of bookshelves in here, do so to get *TM20 Safeguard* in the bottom-left corner as well as the *Corrosive Field Readout*. Enter the door on the right. Inside you'll find an *Ill-Fated Doll* and by talking to Growlithe and then the crevasse you find will find out what happened to Police Officer #5. Reading on the job: never again.

Enter the left room of the library if you'd like. Inside you'll meet a man.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Radomus in the library (+1 Radomus)

Back outside, chop the tree to your left and enter the felled building.

!battle(["Brenna", :MeteorGrunt_090, 0])

Re-enter the jungle to the left. Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy S* and *Burn Heal*. You can talk to Amaria here, the second time she'll heal your party even.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Amaria in the jungle (+1 Amaria)

Cut down the wiggly tree nearby, then head back through the path through Beryl by the library, the jungle, and the underroot to return to the healing house in the eastern side of the jungle. It's time to finish up in this area. 

**NOTE: Reborn has multiple story splits throughout the game. There are multiple routes in the postgame based on decisions in the main game - one of these routes is more exclusive. That said, you actually get MORE story and context in the "normal" postgame route, so I personally recommend pursuing the exclusive route only on a second playthrough. Though for completion, I will still list all of the prerequisites for entering this route throughout this guide.**

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to save all five officers by this point.**

Prepare your team as necessary, and head up.

!battle(["Ace of Clubs", :ACECLUBS, 0], "Forest Field")

Finally we get to battle Meteor's Ace themselves. I wish there was a way to not spoil the surprise of their first Pokemon in this guide, but that Pokemon and many more on their team have Grass moves that feed off of the terrain's 1.5x boost. Braixen can steal your items and hit pretty hard with Psybeam and Fire Spin, and Roselia, as we've seen with Fern, is a hard hitting and healing monster in the early game. Be extra careful with the ultimate PULSE Tangrowth: it likes to get boosts from double-strength Growth and Stamina, then hit hard with Stored Power.

One thing to consider is that, past Braixen, a Bug type can do pretty well here against their team, especially a special attacker or one with Swarm. Cut will also hit for double damage on Roselia and Tangrowth. If you're holding a Telluric Seed, it gives you a free Spiky Shield on its holder's first turn, so in a pinch you can abuse that to set up one of your own Pokemon so that Tangrowth goes down before it can boost too much. Or, you can simply use Slugma or Numel to transform the field to Burning and watch the majority of their team burn passively each turn.

Once you win, you can find a hidden *Super Repel* in the next area. Head down. Here, you'll see a scene involving Corey.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Find all five officers before fighting Ace (+1 Heather, +1 Anna, +1 Shade)

## Beryl Ward & Beryl Cemetery

With that out of the way, we now can actually explore the main part of Beryl Ward.

!enc(151)

Before we do anything else, talk to the backpacker nearby a dumpster down from the Pokemart. If you give him $5000 he will give you the *Magnetic Lure*, an amazing item that, when equipped by your party leader, guarantees you will encounter a Pokemon you haven't caught yet in an area. No more do you have to aimlessly wander around an area looking for that 4% encounter!

Nearby, on clear days, you'll find another snax vendor.

!shop("Beryl Ward Snax", [["PokeSnax", 200]])

Enter the building up and to the left from this guy. On a sunny day, go onto the rooftop to be able to obtain **Helioptile** in exchange for some snax. Inside the Pokemon center, an NPC will tell you a password: *easyhms*.

Around the town, you can find 2 hidden *Blue Shards*, *Escape Rope*, *Fighting Gem*, *Potion*, *Red Shard*, and *HP Up*. 

Continuing to the left into the cemetery area, you can find hidden *Elemental Seed* and *Poke Ball*.

!enc(152)

Next, we're gonna head back through the jungle to get to the library. In the left room you can find a *TwistedSpoon*. Could be useful soon.

Back in the jungle, explore around the area where we fought Ace. You'll find a hidden *Petaya Berry*, *Red Shard* as well as a *Great Ball*.

That about wraps up everything we can do for now, so head to the top of the hill in Beryl.

## VS. Agent Borealis

Head into the gym.

### Didn't Save Police Route

If you saved the officers before fighting Ace, [jump to the next section](#saved-police-officers-route).

If you want to access Corey's bedroom, you can turn all the pillars red.

Head up and into the battle room.

!battle(["Corey", :Corey, 0], "Corrosive Field")

As you can probably tell from the Corrosive Field notes, you'll be worn down by Poison type entry damage. Grass types have a really rough time here, and many special Ground moves otherwise super-effective against his team are cancelled out by a Poison type modifier. Thankfully half of his team isn't too dreadful: Skrelp and Nidorina don't hit too hard, and Croagunk isn't too threatening aside from his priority Sucker Punch. Mareanie hits hard with Merciless and Venoshock both always activated, but it's slow and not too bulky. His Skuntank however can hit decently hard by stacking Acid Sprays, and with its bulk, it can be a threat. You also need to be careful of Aftermath, which can knock out your sweeper. Most difficult of all is his Crobat, since it outspeeds almost every Pokemon you can have by this point and hits like a truck on this field with activated Venoshock.

The key here is putting yourself in a position to be able to deal with Crobat. Thankfully, it's frail enough to die to one or two strong super-effective hits, so by either raising your speed or sending in something with some bulk, you may find success. Your own Poison types and Steel types are immune to a lot of the field's shenanigans, hence are good options. Psychic types are good as long as you can play around Sucker Punch. As long as you aren't going with Mud Shot and Mud Bomb, Ground types can be good at sweeping the weaker members of the team. You can also try to use the field to your advantage to some extent: Sleep Powder becomes 100% accurate here, and the Telluric Seed gives any Pokemon a free turn of protect. Unfortunately unless you're using your own Poison type strategies there isn't really much else you can do to exploit this field yourself, so bring a strong team and you can prevail.

### Saved Police Officers Route

If you didn't make this choice, [jump to the next section](#episode-4-aftershocks).

Talk to the chief to get the *Corrosive Mist Field Readout*.

!battle(["Jameson", :PoliceOfficer, 0])

!battle(["Lambert", :PoliceOfficer, 0])

!battle(["Blackwell", :PoliceOfficer, 0])

Turn all of the pillars blue. Each one will also change its neighbors, so keep that in mind while you solve this puzzle.

Talk to the agent in his room, then head up into the arena once you're ready.

!battle(["Borealis", :Corey, 0], "Corrosive Mist Field atop Corrosive Field")

The Corrosive Mist Field notes explain that your non Poison and Steel types will be Poisoned by the field. Your special flying moves and bubble-based attacks will be nerfed against him as well. Thankfully half of his team isn't too dreadful: Skrelp and Nidorina don't hit too hard, and Croagunk isn't too strong, though it's Sucker Punch does have priority. Mareanie hits hard with Merciless and Venoshock exploiting your team being poisoned, but it is slow and not too bulky. However, Skuntank can hit decently hard by stacking Acid Sprays and hitting with boosted Flamethrower, and with its bulk it can stick around for a bit. It's Aftermath ability can also knock out your sweeper, so be careful. The biggest threat on his team is Crobat: it outspeeds almost every Pokemon you can have by this point and hits like a truck on this field with activated Venoshock. If you let it boost with Nasty Plot, it's very hard to win from there.

On this field, you really have to go fast so you're not worn down by Poison. On top of this, your goal has to be finding a way to deal with Crobat, since it likes to revenge kill your Pokemon that have already taken tons of Poison damage and sweep. However, it's frail enough to die to one or two well strong super-effective hits, so keeping a sturdy Rock, Electric, Ice, or Psychic type in the back holding the Atk/SpA boosting Elemental Seed may lead you to success. Your own Poison types and Steel types are immune to a lot of the field's shenanigans, hence are good options. Psychic types are good as long as you can play around Sucker Punch. I recommend using Fire moves since they're boosted by the field - only Skrelp and Mareanie resist them and they can hit hard in the right circumstances. A unique thing you can do is exploit the fact that Incinerate, Flame Burst, and Self-Destruct will knock out both active Pokemon and switch you to Corrosive Field (suggestions for that, if needed, are in the previous subsection), so if you are having trouble with Crobat or Skuntank you can send in a full health Slugma or Numel and try to do a kill from the grave.
