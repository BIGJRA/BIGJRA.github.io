# Episode 10: Into Darkness

Back inside, talk to the crew here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Laura on the couch (+1 Laura)

Next, talk to Noel in the stairs room. You'll hear a (non-Julia induced) boom, indicating it's time to return to Tanzan Mountain once more.

## Tanzan Mountain Boom and Goodies

Enter Tanzan Mountain and this time go to the left. You'll see a barrier is now destroyed, so follow the path. Snag a hidden *Potion*, *Green Shard*, and *Hyper Potion* then go up into the next room. Grab the *X Sp. Atk* and go up to find Saphira.

You'll get the *Ruby Ring* and *Amethyst Pendant*! Sweet.

There are also hidden *Ice Heal*, *Red Shard*, and *Revive* in this room. Meeting Saphira allows us to access a few more goodies in Tanzan Mountain before we proceed through the door at the top.

Make your way back to the meteor base on the right side and follow the path. In this first room you can find 2 hidden *Green Shards*, *Burn Heal*, *Potion*, and *Clever Wing*. Exit at the bottom left. This is the room where Steelix was tunneling previously. Going straight to the right, you'll find a *Metal Coat* - meaning you can now get your own Steelix!

Head left, up, and left again. You'll see a new cave entrance here. Inside you'll find the *Thick Club* as well as some mining rocks. Back outside this room, go up and walk across the iron girder, and enter the door to the next room.

!enc(260, nil, nil, "Tanzan Depths (Across the Beam)")

Here you can grab an *Upgrade*.

That's all for Tanzan Depths for now, so you can Dig or Escape Rope to get back to Tanzan Mountain proper and go up from the area where you got the jewelry from Saphira.

## Route 1

We actually start in the South Aventurine Woods, however.

!enc(282)

You'll find hidden *Purple Shard* and *Green Shard* here, but we can't go left or right in this area quite yet. Instead, head up and enter Route 1 proper... but prepare yourself.

!battle(["Fern", :Hotshot, 5], "Grassy Terrain")

It's almost like Fern was just waiting on the very edge of the map with Grassy Terrain to fight us! His Roserade and Decidueye are as always a tough combo: Roserade will put you to sleep, Decidueye will try to sweep, and both will sit back, passively heal, and enjoy the field boosts. His Rhydon is annoyingly tanky thanks to its Eviolite and has wide coverage but doesn't hit too hard. His Haxorus and Krookodile (and Scyther, I guess) will try to sweep you with attack / speed boosts.

A good sweeper can find some success if they resist Haxorus or Rhydon's attacks, but you'll have to watch out for Shadow Sneak. You can also mutate the field to Burning if you want, obviously neutering his Grass types instead of helping them. I'd make the case that Noel is overall a harder fight than Fern in general so by making it here you should be able to succeed.

So, now we get to explore Route 1. Only in Pokemon Reborn do we finally reach Route 1 after getting 7 badges.

!enc(285)

You'll also find pairs of **Tauros** and **Bouffalant** all over the route. If you fight Tauros, the Bouffalant will go running off in the direction it's facing, which means that any logs in the way will be pushed. If you fight Bouffalant, Tauros will let you ride it, meaning you can now go up ledges. Game changer.

As a note: there are a bunch of entrances to the North and South Aventurine Woods scattered about Route 1. I'll take us into the woods to explore a bit later and focus on Route 1 for now.

!img("route1_1.png")

Start by going left. Before hopping up or down any edges, you can find a hidden *Nugget* here. Head down one ledge to the left, in this "level" of the route, you can find hidden *Blue Shard*, *Red Shard*, and *Purple Shard*. Defeat the two circled Tauros here to cause Bouffalant to clear some paths for us, which will come in handy later on.

!battle(["Elliot", :YOUNGSTER, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Head down the ledge to the left. On this level, you'll find hidden *X Sp. Atk*, *Elemental Seed*, and *Blue Shard*. Defeat the next circled Tauros to clear another path in the Aventurine Woods, then go down the next ledge. Up from here, defeat the Tauros (top left of the above image) to open a shortcut. You'll also find a hidden *Carbos* here.

!img("route1_2.png")

Hidden to the left are a *Green Shard* and *Great Ball*. Hop down the ledge to the left to get hidden *Escape Rope*, *Blue Shard*, and *Grass Gem*. The Miltank around here will do a trade with us: one Oran Berry for its *Moomoo Milk*. Make sure you have at least one Moomoo Milk in your bag for a quest way later.

!battle(["Armin", :TechNerd, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Anyways, head inside the building here.

Someone on the first floor will give us 8 *Honeys*. Useful for a quest we'll embark on in a bit. Upstairs someone will give us the password *allfieldapp*, and another person will tell us they lost their glasses. This will also be our main healing hub for now. Upstairs, you can do an in-game trade: our Dunsparce for **Tyrogue**. This is repeatable actually, so if you want to get more Tyrogue at higher levels for evolution purposes, you can do so. Grab the *Wide Lens* here as well.

Back outside, head down the ledge here. You'll find a hidden *Dragon Gem*. Down another ledge, you can grab a *Lax Mint* as well as a hidden *Magical Seed*.

!battle(["Cameron", :TechNerd, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Defeat the Tauros to the right to open another shortcut. Jump down once more.

!battle(["Oltan", :HIKER, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

You can find hidden *Ice Heal* and *PokeSnax* here. Finally, on the bottom level, you can find hidden *Red Shard*, *Purple Shard*, and *Poke Ball*.

!battle(["Nelly", :RANGERF, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

You'll notice inside the gate at the bottom we can't do anything, so head back out. Knock out a Bouffalant to get a Tauros mount, which we can use to climb the ledges back up Route 1! Make your way back to where we fought Fern. You'll notice as you go that you will be unable to go through tall grass on your Tauros. The path through this section of woods on Tauros looks like the following:

!img("route1_3.png")

Note that this means we do have to briefly enter the North Aventurine Woods to keep our mount - alternatively you could also climb the ledge near the youngster, dismount, then get a new Tauros mount to the right. This takes more time however, so I recommend the woods when traversing Route 1 here.

!enc(289, ["Grass", "Headbutt"])

You can also find a hidden *Poke Ball* in here. Make your way out to the right and back onto Route 1, then proceed east.

!img("route1_4.png")

To progress to the right while still on your Tauros, you'll need to have the top left Bouffalant move a log, so defeat Tauros. Hop up the ledge to the right.

!battle(["Steve", :PkMnRANGER_Male, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

!battle(["Hark", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

You can find an *Exp. Candy L* as well as 2 hidden *Green Shards*, and *Electric Gem*. Note while you're here that you can pet Flareon, the first of many Eeveelutions we'll need to pet for that sidequest.

On the next ledge to the right you'll find a *Great Ball*, *Ether*, and *Tiny Mushroom*.

!battle(["Rufus", :HIKER, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

!battle(["Brian", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Defeat the two Tauros here to get Bouffalant to push more logs out of the way.

!img("route1_5.png")

To the right you'll need to use the bottom of three ledges to make it to the right on your Tauros. Up here you'll find hidden *Great Ball* and *Super Potion*. The ledge to the right is the only one on the route that goes downwards. Jump down it.

!battle(["Montgomery", :HIKER, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

!battle(["Sully", :RANGERF, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

You can find hidden *Chewing Gum*, *Telluric Seed*, *PP Up*, *Red Shard*, and *Heart Scale* in this area. You'll notice we can't access the walled off area at the bottom-right while on a Tauros, so we'll come back here later on. Knock out the Tauros in the top area and progress up the next hill.

On the next hill you can get a hidden *PokeSnax*, and *Purple Shard*.

!img("route1_6.png")

Grab the hidden *Poke Ball* to the right. Use the bottom of two ledges to head up and grab a hidden *Dire Hit*, then head up once more. Pick up the hidden *Poke Ball*, *Red Shard*, and *Zinc*.

!battle(["Medius", :RANGERF, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

!battle(["Rosch", :HIKER, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Grab the hidden *Ghost Gem*, 2 *Purple Shards*, and *Synthetic Seed*. In the bottom corner you can use Strength to get a *Protector*.

With that out of the way, dismount off your Tauros with 'A' and jump down the ledges down and to the left until we reach the secluded part we skipped earlier. Beat this final Tauros to move one more log, then grab the hidden *Super Repel*. Up above you should find another pair of fighting bulls - beat Bouffalant to get another Tauros mount, then return all the way to the right. We can't do anything in the top area for now, so head down and into the Vanhanen Labyrinth.

## Vanhanen Castle

!enc(292)

You can get the *Chess Board Field Readout* as well as hidden *Ice Gem*, *Red Shard*, *Nugget*, *Blue Shard*, *Exp. Candy XL*, *Timer Ball*, *Dusk Ball*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Purple Shard*, *Health Wing*, *Magical Seed*, and *Quick Ball* all throughout the labyrinth. Grab the *Purple Shard* in a nearby rock then enter the castle.

Heal and prep your team, then enter the next room. Here we can pet Umbreon for the quest, but make sure you do this now since this is a limited time petting opportunity!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Luna's Umbreon (+1 Luna)

Anyways, talk to Luna.

!battle(["Cain", :Cain, 5], "Chess Board")

This battle features the new Chess Board Field. While fields like Grassy Terrain and Super-Heated Field are fairly intuitive, you really should read up about Chess Board field as much as possible and use this battle to learn the ins-and-outs. Essentially, each team member will get a chess board piece rank that will affect various things like stat boosts and even priority. They are fixed for each ordered team, although some will change depending on ordering, so keep that in mind as you make a chess board team. Luckily, this means that the opponents' teams will always predictably use the same ranks, so I will list them for each major chess fight.

Anyways, with all that said, Cain doesn't really have a ton of optimization here with his team, although it is getting better. He now uses Mimikyu, which is always a bit annoying to fight thanks to its ability and optimal moveset. His Muk and Nidoking are strong as ever, and his Primarina and Marowak may be slow but will hit you really hard. The key to winning this one is probably just consistent fast offense with a couple of things in the back to deal with Mimikyu and Nidoking if need be.

Anyways, once you win, we can talk to Luna.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Luna after G. Gardevoir is captured (+1 Luna)

Head back out and talk to Radomus and Cain again. Then exit via the labyrinth, hop on a Tauros and make your way all the way down the route to the Grand Stairway that was empty earlier. Note that we will need to win another one of those "impossible story battles" coming up soon to keep open our options for a postgame route, so plan your team accordingly.

## Citae Astrae

Once you enter, you'll see El run to the left. Follow him, then talk to Radomus to jump down. You can find a hidden *Star Piece*. Talk to Radomus and go down. Grab the hidden *Stardust* and go down the ladder.

Hey look! We made it to another chunk of the grand stairway that we couldn't access earlier. Grab hidden *Burn Heal*, *Repel*, *Big Pearl*, *Full Heal*, and *Super Repel* as you make your way right. In the next room, pick up 3 hidden *Purple Shards*, then exit to the left. Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy L* and go down the ladder. In this room you can find a hidden *Stardust* and 3 *Star Pieces*. Go up and into the new area.

After a scene, you'll be free to explore.

!enc(305)

In this area, you can find 5 hidden *Star Pieces*, *Shoal Shell*, and *Shiny Stone*. Say that ten times fast.

Enter the building here. We can use our Ruby Ring to access a door. Inside, you'll find the first of many of Reborn's logic-by-contradiction puzzles. The ones in here shouldn't be too crazy, so I recommend solving these yourself. Anyways, the answer:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Chimchar Dark, Monferno Dark, Infernape Light </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the Chimchar puzzle answer</a>
</div>

After the puzzle, go through the teleporter. You can actually make your way back through the purple teleporter to grab a *Exp. Candy XL*. With that, head up and into the door.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree to give Adrienn the ring (+1 Adrienn, -1 Cain)
- Refuse to give Adrienn the ring (-1 Adrienn, +1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Adrienn about the pronouns when the player is Non-binary (+1 Adrienn)

Note that we will eventually get points for free for being the other genders too. Enter the red door for another logic puzzle.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Hitmonchan: Dark, Hitmonlee: Light, Tyrogue: Light, Hitmontop: Dark
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the Tyrogue puzzle answer</a>
</div>

Use the Light Shard (or wait till we catch a few Pokemon) and head out.

!enc(306, nil, nil, "Citae Astrae Rooftop")

Once you're ready, talk to El at the top. You will have to choice between siding with El, or Radomus. If you choose the former, you're allowed to lose the upcoming battle, but if you choose the latter, you must win to progress.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to side with Radomus and win.**

!battle(["El", :EL, 0], "Crystal Cavern")

One thing to note is that Judgement will cycle between gaining Fire, Water, Grass, and Psychic type bonus damage. Using that fact, lowering its special attack, or using one of the strategies we've seen so far to deal with these 6v1 "impossible" fights should suffice if you want to win.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Side with El and lose (+3 Elias, +1 Adrienn, -3 Gardevoir, -2 Luna, -2 Radomus)
- Side with El and win (+1 Cain, +2 Elias, +2 Adrienn, -2 Gardevoir, -2 Luna, -2 Radomus)
- Side with Radomus and win (+2 Radomus, +2 Luna, +3 Gardevoir, +1 Anna, +1 Shade, +1 Cain, -1 Adrienn, -2 Elias)

With that, agree to leave together. Exit out of the Grand Gate, then make your way to Coral Ward. Talk to Adrienn here, then accept fast travel if you wish back to Vanhanen Castle. I will recommend not doing that so we can prep for an upcoming sidequest.

We're gonna need about 30 Honeys for the next section - I recommend buying only about 5 honeys and then making sure you have 8-9 candies in your bag, as we will be able to trade them for honey later. A single Blue Moon Ice Cream can also be exchanged for tons of Honey if you happen to have one.

Not that you should spend your money on them, but the Sweet Kiss now sells higher-tier Exp. Candies!

!shop("Sweet Kiss (Bottom) (7+ Badges)", ["Common Candy", ["Exp. Candy XS", 500], ["Exp. Candy S", 2000], ["Exp. Candy M", 5000], ["Exp. Candy L", 10000], ["Exp. Candy XL", 20000], "Rare Candy"])

There is also one new trainer on the Opal Bridge. By defeating him, you'll learn about the password *minlevel*.

!battle(["Kaz", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

## North Aventurine Woods Exploration

Once you're ready, head to the Route 1 Nature Center, grab a Tauros mount, and go right.

!img("route1_7.png")

Enter 1N, the first entrance to the forest that you see. This will simply spit us out at 2N. To the right, enter 3N.

!img("naw_1.png")

Go up and you'll find a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and a *Potion*. A web will block us from proceeding, so we'll have to dismount up here and walk through the tall grass to the left. You can talk to the tree (A) here to slather it with honey - when you do, Heracross and Pinsir will show up and fight for it. If you need a nearby web broken, defeat Pinsir and Heracross will do it for you. If you need a nearby log broken, defeat Heracross, and Pinsir will do it for you. Note that throughout the woods we cannot catch these two bugs. Anyways, defeat the Pinsir here.

Head to the right from here and go through another set of tall grass, but don't go down this ledge just yet. Throughout our adventures in the woods, if you appear to be stuck, step on the Red and White flower tile - don't pull out the Floral Charm just set, I'm saving that for a specific flower later on - and you'll be sent back to Route 1.

Down from here, you'll find a hidden *Mental Herb* and another honey tree (B). Interact with it twice and defeat both bugs to get a *Leaf Stone* and *TM86 Grass Knot*. Exit back to Route 1, hop on a Tauros, and head back into 3N. Pass tree A and climb the ledge, then dismount. Grab the hidden *Oran Berry* and *Elemental Seed* then enter Celestinine Mountain here.

!enc(387, ["Cave", "Fishing"], ["Old", "Good"], "Celestinine Mountain B2F - 3F")

Note that we will eventually want a Qwilfish for an in-game trade.

Grab the hidden *Ether* and *Repel*, then make your way to the ice puzzle. Slide your way to the center, then slide left and up from the top left part of the center to get the *Icy Field Readout*. Oh, and the Icy Rock to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is here as well. Slide to the left and down to head down some stairs from here.

Pick up an *Ice Stone* up here as well as a hidden *Potion*. You can also find *TM23 Smack Down* in here. Do some fishing if you'd like, then exit out to the woods the way we came in and return to Route 1.

!img("route1_8.png")

Grab a Tauros mount and head east from 3N in search for 4N. Once you find it, head in.

!img("naw_2.png")

Grab the hidden *Dire Hit* and *Big Mushroom*. If you go up and left, "To C" on the map, you can reach a tree (C) from the previous map under which we can fight a Pinsir to open a shortcut, though this one isn't required to get any rewards. Head back to the right and go up, then dismount. Past the tall grass, you'll find some soil to plant berries in if you'd like as well as the *Pikanium-Z* and a *Green Shard*. Enter the building here.

A Pikachu on the ground floor is actually a tutor.

!tutor("Nyu's Pikachu Move Tutor", [["Volt Tackle", "Free"]])

Talk to the guy upstairs - he will tell us he is the PC administrator, and also heal our Pokemon! You can also talk to him with candy or ice cream in your bag - he will give us 3 *Honeys* for each. If we give him *Blue Moon Ice Cream*, we'll get *40 Honeys*.

Back outside, go down then right. You'll see another Honey tree (D) - defeat Pinsir to clear some webs. Unless you really like the animation of Pinsir smashing logs, we can ignore the nearby short log. Grab the hidden *Burn Heal* and go up - we'll be blocked by long log for now! Exit to Route 1.

!img("route1_9.png")

Hop on a Tauros, and enter 5N to the right. Pick up the hidden *Red Shard*, and witness the conversation to the right.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you did see that just now (-1 Titania)
- Say you didn't see that just now (-2 Titania)

To the right, 6N will spit us back out onto Route 1, so enter 7N to the east. Pick up the hidden *Paralyze Heal* and dismount, then go left and up. You'll find Honey tree E here - beat Heracross to clear a log to the left. Head back down and to the right here, then go up through the tall grass. There's another Honey tree (F) - beat Heracross again to clear a log.

Head back out to Route 1, and pick up a Tauros mount. Head right back in to 7N and go up the ledge at the top. Grab the *Sharp Beak* as well as hidden *Synthetic Seed* and *Tiny Mushroom*.

!enc(289, ["Fishing"], ["Old", "Good"])

Finally, head back to Route 1, pick up a Tauros mount (if there are none, go west through 6N to 5N) and enter 4N once more. Follow the path to the right and go up the ledge here. Grab the *Exp. Candy XL*, *Calm Mint*, *Careful Mint*, and 2 *Lum Berries*. Also you can find hidden *Great Ball* and *Red Shard*. Return to Route 1.

## South Aventurine Woods Exploration

Getting everything in the South Aventurine Woods is a bit more complicated, so to make things easier, we will start at the rightmost entrance to the South Aventurine Woods first.

!img("route1_9.png")

Head east on Route 1 and enter 8S in the above map, noting that you'll have to dismount in order to reach this woods entrance.

!img("saw_3.png")

Inside, grab the hidden *Revive* then use the Honey tree (Q) two times to destroy both of the nearby obstacles. Exit out of 8S, then go left to 7S. You can get a *Water Gem* here and exit on the other side at 6S. Our next destination is all the way to the west, so stop by the Route 1 Nature Center to heal if you'd like.

!img("route1_7.png")

Enter 1S on the far west side of Route 1.

!img("saw_1.png")

Grab a hidden *Clever Wing* then go up the ledge and follow the path. Dismount, then talk to Honey tree (G) and beat the Pinsir. Down this ledge is 2S, which we can take to emerge onto Route 1. Find a Tauros mount and return to 2S.

Up the ledge to the right you'll find a hidden *Max Repel*. Dismount up here, then go down through the patch of tall grass. Use the Honey tree (I) and fight Pinsir. Make your way back to Route 1, grab a Tauros, then reenter 2S yet again. 

Go right at this fork, staying on Tauros to climb the ledge below tree (I). Dismount up here and go down through the tall grass. Use the Honey tree (H) and fight Heracross this time, then return to Route 1. One more time, get a Tauros and re-enter 2S.

This time, go down at the first fork. Follow the path and jump up the ledge at the bottom. Pick up the *Link Stone*, 2 *Sitrus Berries*, and hidden *Magical Seed*. Drop down and go up the ledge immediately to the right, then dismount. Pick up the hidden *Revive* in the next area, then use the Honey tree (J) and fight Heracross. Exit out of 3S above, get a Tauros mount, and return to 3S.

Go up the ledge at the bottom, use the Honey tree (K) and fight Pinsir. Grab the hidden *Purple Shard*. You'll notice we can't progress this way any further. Return to Route 1.

!img("route1_8.png")

Next, we'll be entering 4S - you'll know you're in the right place if you recognized where we fought Fern.

!img("saw_2.png")

Anyways, lather the Honey tree closest to you (N) and fight Pinsir, then make your way right and dismount - don't go down the ledge to 5S though. Grab hidden *Escape Rope*, *Purple Shard*, and *Potion* then make your way down through the tall grass. At the bottom is another Honey tree (P); defeat Heracross here. Make your way back up partway through the tall grass and you'll notice an opening (orange in the above image). Pull out the Floral Charm when prompted to to battle **Flabebe**! Head straight to the right and grab the hidden *Oddishweed* in the bush. Head back and get lulled into a daze to return to Route 1.

Again, enter 4S, this time not needing a Tauros mount, and head down. Use the nearby Honey tree (M) two times to clear both obstacles. Go down and immediately to the right, use another Honey tree (O) and fight Heracross. Finally, head left and down the ledge and use the Honey tree nearest Tanzan (L) and fight Heracross. Follow the path to the left, and you'll emerge at 3S. 

Get a Tauros mount and reenter 3S, this time, going down and following the newly opened path. At a fork, you'll get *TM51*, 2 *Custap Berries*, and a hidden *Telluric Seed*. Make sure you save one of these Custap Berries for a quest later on.

Follow the path to the right and up. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Star Piece* along the way. Go left at the fork and pick up the *Tech Glasses* as well as a hidden *Repel* and *Link Stone*, then head right.

!img("saw_3.png")

Grab the hidden *Fire Gem*. Down the ledge you'll finally see why I had us do 8S first... anyways follow the path right then go up. Get the hidden *PP Up* and finally dismount, then head up into the grass.

Here, you can grab a *Razor Claw* and *TM40 Aerial Ace* as well as hidden *Silver Powder* and *Magical Seed*. You'll also find a Heracross and a Pinsir here, but you need to choose. To get **Heracross** defeat the Pinsir, and to get **Pinsir** defeat the Heracross. We'll be able to obtain the other later.

That wraps up our exploration of the woods!

Return to the Route 1 Nature Center and talk to the guy on the second floor who lost his specs. In exchange for the Tech Glasses we will get *Department Store Sticker: Heracross*!

!shop("Department Store 8F (Left)", ["X Attack", "X Defend", "X Sp. Atk", "X Speed", "X Sp. Def", "Guard Spec.", "X Accuracy", "Dire Hit"])

I've never used any of these in my entire life, but if you want to, go for it.

!shop("Department Store 8F (Right)", ["Big Root", "Focus Band", "Zoom Lens", "Scope Lens", "Bright Powder", "Quick Claw", "Protective Pads"])

We've gotten some of these already but sheesh finally some mildly decent non-consumable held items for sale.

## Grand Hall Trainers 5

By defeating Noel, trainers in the Grand Hall have gotten stronger once more. Defeating them will now yield 6 *Exp. Candy L.* The updated teams are as follows:

**Sunday:**

!battle(["Carol", :COOLTRAINER_Female, 2])

!battle(["Gibson", :Casanova, 2])

!battle(["Fawkes", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 2])

**Monday:**

!battle(["Jonah", :YOUNGSTER, 2])

**Tuesday:**

**Saturday:**

!battle(["Anthony", :EXPERT_Male, 2])

!battle(["Emile", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 2])

!dbattle(["Zach", :Casanova, 2], ["Beau", :LADY, 2])

With that out of the way, you can use the Tauros shortcut just north of the Grand Gate to make your way to Vanhanen Castle once more.

## Millenium Badge

After talking to the group at the entrance, go up two rooms. Radomus will explain the puzzle. Enter the room on the left and grab a *Psychic Memory*.

Talk to Elias here for more details on the puzzle, etc.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Ask Elias about himself (+1 Elias)

The screen in here will also tell us what our current team chess piece ranks would be in its current ordering, useful for planning for the upcoming fight.

Anyways, it's time to clear all the chess puzzles. I will spoiler the solutions.

Move on to the next room. Note that the Bishops must be talked to first from one direction, then you choose its diagonal direction afterwards. So, to go up-left you talk to it from the right then press up, or talk to it from below and press left.

<div class="spoilerDiv">

!battle(["Thyme", :PSYCHIC_Male, 0], "Chess Board")

Head up and into the next room when you are ready for your gym battle.

!battle(["Radomus", :RADOMUS, 0], "Chess Board")

Especially if you've played previous versions, you'll notice that Radomus' team on top of his field is able to get up 8-Turn Trick Room almost always, since his two leads both have it and get a Focus Sash effect as pawns. Then, with their low speed advantage, Malamar will then usually go for its Contrary Superpower set up, while Reuniclus will try to hit insanely hard  with Psychic/Rock type boosted Psychic. His Gallade gets attack on switch in, has lots of coverage, and can use a boosted Rock type Strength, while his Metagross gets free +1 Priority on all of its hard-hitting attacks including Strength and Meteor Mash. Slowking gets defensive boosts upon switch in and can even set up Nasty Plot, and essentially outspeeds everything under Trick Room, which it has as a backup. Finally, his Gardevoir is EV trained, a bit tanky thanks to Queen bonuses, has a berry,  hits really hard with boosted Psychic, and can also set up on you. A stacked team that has a tendency to completely steamroll the unprepared under Trick Room.

One strategy you can try to use to win is to shut down Trick Room altogether. Using moves like Fake Out, Taunt, Spore, etc. will allow you to stall the Trick Room users long enough that you can hopefully knock them out on the second or third turn with super-effective Bug/Dark/Ghost moves. Successfully defeating both leads before Trick Room allows you to exploit the low speeds! Metagross will still have priority and Slowking can use Trick Room when it comes in, so be careful of that. If that isn't working, you can also bring an Oranguru from the forest and use Trick Room yourself to cancel it at any time. Alternatively, aside from Slowking and Reuniclus, the rest of his team has respectable base speed, so you can potentially win (lose?) the speed race and bring your own super slow team. Knocking out Reuniclus turn one or two will then mean your slower Pokemon may go first over everything except Metagross and Slowking. A Pokemon like Escavalier is great in this context.

Your team composition with respect to chess pieces is going to important regardless of your speed strategies. For your leads, take two Pokemon that can get you momentum for your strategy, keeping in mind that they're guaranteed to live one hit each as Pawns. Then, you're going to want your hardest hitting Pokemon or one that desperately needs priority to be a King if possible, though without a King's Rock at this point, this can be tough to arrange. The rest of your team will naturally fall into Rook/Bishop/Queen - save a bulky but strong attacker for the latter, and consider a Synthetic Seed if you have a special-attacking Bishop. If you happen to have a Pokemon with speed as its best stat, it will become a Knight and can be a great choice to OHKO Queen Gardevoir. Using the field notes, rearrange your team with respect to chess pieces accordingly.

You can exploit the Chess Board in other ways as well: you can use Strength/Secret Power yourself for a field boost. These moves will shoot through the roof in power if you can confuse your opponents with something like Teeter Dance first. You also get a boost when using Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, which you can use to ignore Trick Room speed tiers entirely and net some easy KO's against his frail Psychic types. Defensively, you can use Pokemon with Adaptability, Telepathy, Anticipation, or Synchronize to eat Radomus' Psychic and Strength attacks. And of course, there is always the angry child approach of using Stomping Tantrum to flip the board and go to a neutral field.

Once you win, you'll get the *Millenium Badge* which pushes our cap up to Lv. 65 as well as *TM92 Trick Room*. Trick Room is a top 5 TM in the game due to its ability to reverse the sweeping power of speedy enemy field-boosted threats, so it's fantastic that we get it for the rest of the game!
