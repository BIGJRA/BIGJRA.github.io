# Episode 1: Reborn, the City of Ruin

Welcome to my 100% walkthrough of Pokemon Reborn.

My aim with this document is to provide a complete route through the game including every single item including hidden ones, available Pokemon, some tips for battle strategies, shop and tutor details, and more. To summarize my approach: if you're the type of person that doesn't really like having tons of tabs open at once while you're trying to 100% complete this game, hopefully my guide may be useful for you.

Since this guide is complete, there are some parts that may spoil events that happen later in the game. I try to be vague about story details, but you may want to consider playing the game once first without referencing this walkthrough if this is a concern.

## All Aboard!

The game will first ask you to choose a player character and gender. It will then ask you if you want to view controls. You can actually rebind controls with F1 and even add controller support if you'd like! Once you've gotten acquainted with your chosen controls, you'll find yourself on the train.

Ame will ask you if you have any special instructions or passwords. From the game's readme:

<div id="quote">
    <p> At the start of the game, you will be prompted for special instructions, or passwords. Below is a list of applicable passwords. Please note that these are features are considered a bonus, and may have some  unexpected interactions at times...
    </p><br><br>
    <p>Implement a hard EXP cap when maxed on badges, similar to Pokemon Rejuvenation: </p><br>
        <ul><li>Password: hardcap</li></ul><br>
    <p>Cause randomized early game Pokemon events to bias towards a specific type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Password: mononormal</li>
            <li>Password: monofire</li>
            <li>Password: monowater</li>
            <li>Password: monograss</li>
            <li>Password: monoelectric</li>
            <li>Password: monoice</li>
            <li>Password: monofighting</li>
            <li>Password: monopoison</li>
            <li>Password: monoground</li>
            <li>Password: monoflying</li>
            <li>Password: monobug</li>
            <li>Password: monopsychic</li>
            <li>Password: monorock</li>
            <li>Password: monoghost</li>
            <li>Password: monodragon</li>
            <li>Password: monodark</li>
            <li>Password: monosteel</li>
            <li>Password: monofairy</li>
        </ul><br>
    <p>Prevent Pokemon from being healed after their HP drops to 0:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nuzlocke</li></ul><br>
    <p>Randomly reshuffles species and moves as rolled at game start:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: randomizer</li></ul><br>
    <p>Pokemon do not need to know HM (TMX) moves in order to use them in the field:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: easyhms</li></ul><br>
    <p>Prohibits the player's use of items in trainer battles:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: noitems</li></ul><br>
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 252 EVs and 31 IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: fullevs</li></ul><br>
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 0 EVs and IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: litemode</li></ul><br>
    <p>Makes all Field	Notes visible immediately</p>
        <ul><li>Password: allfieldapp</li></ul><br>
    <p>Remove some randomness by making all attacks do consistent damage rather than a roll:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nodamageroll</li></ul><br>
    <p>Multiple passwords, including differing monotypes, may be used in tandem with
    each other, but progress at your own risk~</p><br><br>
    <p>Other hidden passwords may be able to be found in the game.</p>
</div>

If this is your first time playing, don't worry too much about passwords - in fact, you can activate passwords later on into the game if you change your mind or discover a new password.

- If you want to do a challenge run, try one of the *mono\[type\]* passwords. Note that it doesn't enforce any explicit rules for battle; it simply guarantees you suitable Pokemon for random events. I really recommend trying one of these especially for a second playthrough.
- You can do *nuzlocke* or *randomizer* if you'd like, just note that Nuzlocke doesn't enforce a first-mon-per-area rule explicitly. You can even do both at the same time.
- *hardcap* prevents you from leveling past your current cap, and *easyhms* allows you to use HMs without teaching them to your Pokemon. Reborn was originally built with the disobedience system and normal HM mechanics, but these passwords are highly recommended for quality of life.
- *noitems* makes it so you can't use in battle items like Potion and X-Attack. I prefer this for the extra difficulty it provides and how it increases the value of moves like Recover.
- *nodamagerolls* makes it so moves will always roll the same damage. There are some fights in this game you practically must reset for a couple times at least, so minimizing the randomness is in my opinion pretty handy.
- *fullevs* ramps up the difficulty significantly by making every Pokemon both hit hard and have some bulk. Reborn is already a tough game without this password, so tread carefully with this one.
- *allfieldapp* lets you see data about fields from the start. If you're following this guide I'll be picking up all the notes naturally anyways, so unless you really want to know right away how each field works you'll be ok skipping this one.
- *litemode* is a good choice if you are struggling or want to experience the wonderful characters, world, and puzzles without spending too much time on the battles.

Regardless, *this guide will be from the perspective of a player who is using no passwords.*

After you're done inputting passwords, enjoy the rest of your train ride!

## Grand Hall

As soon as you're off the train, you'll have a conversation with Ame and Julia. Note that I won't be summarizing story events much in this walkthrough aside from gameplay implications.

This conversation does quietly show off a mechanic in Pokemon Reborn: relationship points! Certain dialogue triggers and events will make certain characters like you more or less, interally stored as integer values per character. See [Ame's Devblog post](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/development/records/about-relationship-points-r83/) for an explanation of them; they won't lock you out of any Pokemon, Items, or the like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Yes (+1 Julia)

(Whenever a dialogue choice is not listed, it has no effect on the points.)

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden001.png"/>

Immediately down from your starting position, in a rock you'll find a hidden *Normal Gem* (A). There are tons of hidden items in this game, and we won't get the Itemfinder for another two badges or so.

More hidden items:
- (B): *Poke Ball*
- (C): *Red Shard*

It's worth noting that shards are useful in Reborn for obtaining Ability Capsules and Pokemon as well as learning moves via tutors.

Proceed to the right into Opal Ward. A girl at the bottom of the area will give you a *Potion*. In general, talk to as many people in Reborn as you can - they offer helpful tips for battles, give you useful items, etc.

If the weather is sunny you will see an Ice Cream Cart here.

Every day the Ice Cream Shop appears, there is a 1 in 21 chance that they will be selling the rare Blue Moon Ice Cream. Note that talking to the vendor when they are not selling the ice cream activates a cooldown timer of one day, during which time they will not sell Blue Moon Ice Cream not matter how many times you reset. However, if you save *before* speaking to them, you can reset the game until they are carrying Blue Moon Ice Cream. It is too expensive for us right now by far, but should you ever want to buy it, keep this trick in mind.

Talk to the girl in front of the big building here, and you'll head in. Welcome to the Grand Hall.

Upstairs, you'll be asked which starter Pokemon you'd like to get. You actually get to choose between 21 starters, or you can let fate decide by using the computer at the top of the room. One amazing thing about Reborn is that you can obtain every single Pokemon in the first seven generations within a single save file of Reborn without trading, and that includes the starters. So, regardless of which you pick, you'll be able to get the other 20 eventually. Your choices are:

- The Grass types: **Bulbasaur**, **Chikorita**, **Treecko**, **Turtwig**, **Snivy**, **Chespin**, **Rowlet**
- The Fire types: **Charmander**, **Cyndaquil**, **Torchic**, **Chimchar**, **Tepig**, **Fennekin**, **Litten**
- The Water types: **Squirtle**, **Totodile**, **Mudkip**, **Piplup**, **Oshawott**, **Froakie**, **Popplio**

Another feature that Pokemon Reborn has is that it doesn't lock each Pokemon's 'hidden' ability behind special methods of obtaining: every Pokemon has an equal chance of having its hidden ability as its normal abilities. That means you can get Intimidate Litten, Sheer Force Totodile, Contrary Snivy, etc. as your starter!

It is ultimately up to you what you choose. Many players recommend Torchic due to its Speed Boost ability, but each starter can be useful in its own way.

If you save in front of the starters (quicksave is, by default, 'D'), you can reset (resetting is, by default, F12. You will become very familiar with this button.) until you get one with satisfactory nature, ability, IV's, and even shininess. The shiny rate in this game is roughly 1 in 91 in this game, so you might just end up with a shiny starter on your first try!

Talk to Ame as soon as you're done, and you'll be taken downstairs and fight your first battle! Don't worry quite yet about the "No Field" note.

Note that when one number is listed for EVs and for IVs, it means all six stats have this value.

Thanks to Hustle, Nidoran has a chance to miss. Use your starter's stat lowering move once if you'd like then spam your attacking move and hopefully you can win. Note that winning this one is not required.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Cain in battle (+1 Cain)

Once you are done with that battle, you'll be healed, then thrust into another battle. This is the first of what are generally referred to in this game as "gauntlets". Although not necessarily intended by the game, it is worth noting that if you spam the quicksave key while a character is moving in the mid-gauntlet cutscenes, you can save between gauntlet battles.

You'll be Lv. 6 now if you won the last one. Use a similar strategy and hopefully you'll come out on top. Note that again winning this one is not required.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Victoria in battle (+1 Victoria)

After the battle, Ame will give you the *Pokedex*, the *Pokegear*, and the *Running Shoes*! Plus, Victoria will give you 5 *Poke Balls*.

Now, we can explore the Grand Hall. This is the region's hub building - we will be checking back here often.

Talk to the guy in the top left - he will tell us about the password *litemode*. We can't enter new passwords right now, but we will be able to later.

A guy behind the desk will allow us to bring in grinding trainers to the grand hall. Let them in if you'd like, but note that right now they're a bit too tough for us. We can come back a bit before the gym leader to grind against them later.

Talk to a guy next to some display cases if you'd like to buy some candy.

**Grand Hall Common Candy Shop**

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Grand Hall Candy</strong></th></thead>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Common Candy</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$75</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

As you might guess, Common Candies are the opposite of rare candies - they'll decrease your Pokemon's level. Reborn's disobedience system means that Pokemon above the level cap will not always obey your commands, so these are essential to fix that issue. The current level cap is 20 - until we beat the gym leader, Pokemon won't obey at Lv. 21 and beyond. We shouldn't need any common candies right now though. To his right is another shop:

**Default Shop**

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Default Mart (0 Badges)</strong></th></thead>

<td style="text-align: center">$100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Poke Ball</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center"></td>
</tr>
</table></div>

In this guide I will be catching every single Pokemon as soon as it becomes available, so if you're going to do the same you're gonna need a lot of balls. Note that you get a *Premier Ball* with every 10 balls you purchase. Reborn is tight on money, so especially if you're not interested in using healing items during battles, you might be better off not spending your cash on Potions and Antidotes and running back to Pokemon Centers when needed instead.

On your way out the door, you'll see two people right by the exit. One of them will offer you a Pokemon for $500. But when you do, someone will steal it! If you want to skip this event for now until you have more money you can - we won't actually get to have this Pokemon for... 14 more badges.

That's all we can really do in the Grand Hall for now, so head outside.

Specifically I recommend training up Bidoof as soon as possible - it gets Headbutt at Level 13, which allows you to catch Pokemon in trees. We will also be able to trade away Bibarel for a different Pokemon pretty soon, so that's something to keep in mind. There is also an in-game trade for Watchog a little bit down the road, so you may want to consider at least catching a Patrat for now.

On the left side of the area, in the left broken statue you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*.

Talk to the trainer here with the Snubbull or Stufful, and they will leave. Back at the bottom of the area, you'll now be able to fight trainers to get onto Opal Bridge. The trainers, going clockwise starting to the left:

For beating both of the trainers at the bottom of the stairs, you'll get an *Exp. Candy XS*. There are also some hidden items on the bridge:

When you win, you'll get **Pachirisu** or **Zigzagoon**, randomly determined. Note that whenever there is a random event like this, you will be able to get the other Pokemon later in the game (here is where the monotype passwords would come into play: the *monoelectric* password would guarantee Pachirisu, for example, while *mononormal* would guarantee Zigzagoon).

If you got Zigzagoon, you can train that up instead of Bidoof if you'd like for Headbutt, which it learns at level 11. Also, it might be worthwhile to save before you get the Pokemon: both of these can have the Pickup ability, which can be incredible in Pokemon Reborn. [Click here for details about Pickup in Reborn.](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/pickup/)

That's it for Opal Ward for now, so head back towards the train station.

Next, head right then up as soon as you can.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden003.png"/>

A rock on the left side will contain a hidden *Escape Rope* (A). Talk to the guy here, and give him $150 total. We can't do anything in the house behind him quite yet, so head up from here.

You'll find a gym here. We can't go in yet, but if you go up and around to the right, you'll find a *Gift Box*.

Also, specifically when the weather is thunderstorming, you'll find **Blitzle** here. Since it's Lv. 15 it might be a bit too tough to deal with right now, so you can come back later. Note that this is the first encounter that is only possible with the right weather - if you'd like to avoid having to wait you can use the *weathermod* password at your next opportunity.

To the left, there is a Pokemon Center, and some hidden items outside.

- (B): *Paralyze Heal*
- (C): *Elemental Seed*

Hang on to the latter for now - it will be useful later on. There is another trainer to the left:

A riveting moveset.

In the nearby house, you can take a quiz to find out what types of Pokemon you'd be. It's quite long, but a fun time. You'll also be given a *Type Gem* corresponding to the type you get, as well as learn about the *mono[type]* password.

During a clear daytime, you'll find a Teddiursa! It will run off and we'll have to chase it.

Go left from this area and enter the first house that you can. Inside, you'll find a *PokeSnax*! This item is crucial for getting certain Pokemon.

More hidden items around here include:

- (D): *Purple Shard*
- (E): *Exp. Candy XS*
- (F): *Common Candy*

With the PokeSnax in our bag, we can talk to the northernmost dumpster here to catch **Gulpin**. Inside the house, also thanks to the snax, you'll be able to catch **Whismur**.

Return to the guy we gave money to - behind him in a house you will find **Minccino** or **Espurr**, randomly determined. With the snax in your bag, it will join you!

On the left side of the Pokemon Center, you can find a hidden *Poison Gem* in some trash paper (G). In a house below, a guy will give you the *Old Rod*!

Back outside, we can actually fish in the dirty water.

Head out, and back up past the rod guy's house. You'll find the Name Rater's house here... made obsolete by being able to change a Pokemon's nickname from your party!

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden004.png"/>

- (A): *Heart Scale*
- (B): *Purple Shard*

If it is still a clear daytime, here you'll be able to talk to Teddiursa again, who will run off to a random location. I will cover all the locations later on, but keep in mind finding it three times from here will allow you to battle and catch it.

Enter the building here and talk to the old man for a battle.

There is a trade for Sunkern we can do later on, so I recommend catching one. The topmost bush in this garden contains a hidden *Grass Gem*.

Back in the main part of the ward, head to the right. Enter the first building here. You'll find out about an injured Skitty - when we get an Oran Berry we will be back. Head outside and go right.

Once you beat her, talk to her again for a *Rose Incense*! More hidden items:

- (C): *Antidote*
- (D): *Paralyze Heal*

Up from here, enter the building on the right. Talk to the guy here and give him the Gift Box we found earlier, and you'll obtain a **Delibird**! The building to the right of this one contains an ailing **Kricketot** which you can obtain by talking to the person here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Accept Kricketot (+1 Shelly)
- Reject Kricketot (-1 Shelly)

Kricketune with its Fury Cutter attack and Technician ability can be incredible in the early game, so consider using it.

Back outside, talk to the yellow haired guy for a battle.

Woobat can be pretty solid thanks to its Simple ability, and you can evolve it early with enough friendship.

A rock at the top left contains a hidden *Guard Spec*. Once you're done here, head back to the left and go up past Seacrest's Garden to enter the northern part of Peridot Ward.

## Peridot Ward

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden006.png"/>

- (A): *Poke Ball*
- (B): *Oran Berry*
- (C): *Ability Capsule*

The Ability Capsule will become unobtainable after some more story events, so grab it while you can. In Reborn, you get to choose the Pokemon's target ability when you use one, including hidden abilities.

Choosing to save this Oran Berry for the first gym isn't a bad idea... though we can instead now enter the house immediately on the right back in Lower Peridot Ward to get **Skitty**. Back up from here there are some trainers.

Talk to the fountain while it is raining to battle **Surskit**!

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden008.png"/>

The rock behind the dumpster in the bottom left corner of this plaza contains a *Calcium* (A). I really recommend selling it for a clean $4900 - if you haven't noticed the trainers in this area don't give you much money. Also hidden:

- (B): *Ether*
- (C): *Potion*
- (D): *Red Shard*

Enter the house near the youngsters. Talk to the lady here to begin a quest, then head outside.

Up from here, when the weather is clear or sunny and you have a Rose Incense in your bag, you can talk to **Budew** on the wall to obtain it.

Enter the top left house when you're ready for a battle with the guy who stole our $500 Pokemon! Not just him though, you gotta fight both him and the initial salesman. What a snake!

However, they don't actually have our purchased Pokemon, so we'll just have to continue this quest later.

Once you do, you can get **Igglybuff**! It's worth noting that she will eventually ask for this specific Igglybuff back later in the game; for a reward, you'll need to give it back. So, consider breeding it once we get daycare access if you want to use Wigglytuff.

Anyways, head to the right from the tall building where the Team Meteor Grunts were hiding.

- (A): *Repel*
- (B): *Green Shard*

Our first *Data Chip* is above. You can use it to add a password at any PC!

Head outside. Enter the small building to the left and pickup the *Potion*. 

Outside, head straight to the left. We will traverse this loop clockwise. Enter the first building you come upon. At night, you can catch **Grubbin** or **Joltik**, randomly determined. Note that this will use up one of your snax, so you'll need to buy more to do other snax-related events. Inside the next building to the left is another *Common Candy*.

To the left is a Pokemart. The "Default Shops" in this game operate similarly to main Pokemon game shops in that they update their inventory based on how many badges you have - the Peridot Ward shop will have the same inventory as the Grand Hall shop until we get a badge, then they will both upgrade, for example.

Anyways, a small house up from here contains a *Protein*, which again I recommend selling for more ball money.

This one is a bit harder than the first two rival fights! Watch out for his Budew, who likes to heal, and his Sandile who can rip through your team of six thanks to Moxie if you're not careful. His Rowlet also may juggernaut with a couple of Ominous Wind boosts, so be cautious of those as well. The Delibird we got earlier can shine in this battle (and arguably only this battle...)!

Around this time, your Zigzagoon/Bidoof will be able to learn Headbutt, so there are a few Pokemon you can now obtain. First, head to the garden:

Now is a good time to finish the Teddiursa quest if you haven't already. Keep in mind this has to be done on a clear day. After talking to it in the bottom part of the Lower Peridot Ward and then again on the left side near the Name Rater's house, you'll need to find it three more times. It can be found in one of the following locations, then will be found in the two after it in the list (cyclically).

1. Nearby the train station, where we started the game.
2. Under the Opal Bridge, nearby Panpour/Pansear.
3. Above Mosswater Industrial in between two buildings.
4. Next to the Upper Peridot Ward Pokemart.
5. Next to the rock containing the Calcium near the fountain.
6. Nearby the dumpster where we got Gulpin.
7. In the bottom left corner of Seacrest's garden.

**Teddiursa** will then battle you.

With that out of the way, time to progress the story. Make sure you have your best team for some battles coming up.

You have to two choices: you can head straight to the Mosswater Industrial above Seacrest's Garden, or take a detour first to the Lower Peridot Ward gym. In either case, talk to the character standing in front of the factory when you're ready.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Headed straight to Mosswater Industrial (Fern +1)
- Detoured to Lower Peridot Gym before going to Mosswater (Julia +1)

## Mosswater Industrial

Time for our first dungeon proper! Fern will join us as a partner. Leaving your partner and exiting dungeons tend to have negative effects:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Leave Fern and exit the factory (-1 Fern, just once)

However, talking to your partner while they're walking with you tends to have positive effects:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Fern while you are together (+1 Fern, just once)

Partners also fully heal your team after every battle, which can be useful for grinding.

On the second floor, Rini will start us off with part of the second password: XX6X. Before we proceed, head out the door on the bottom right and follow the path to get an *Exp. Candy S*. Back in the main room, head out to the right and cross the bridge.

Depending on what Pokemon you have this can be a bit difficult since they like to one-shot Fern's Budew, but your sheer numbers can probably overwhelm them regardless.

Outside the factory, Florinia will ask you a question.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Yes (+1 Florinia)

You will then be given the Field Notes App in your Pokegear, and offered to turn on a graphical feature that shows off field effect boosts in battle. I recommend doing this! You will also be given the *Electric Terrain Readout*. You may have noticed we were battling on the Factory Field inside Mosswater. Most of the important trainers in this game we will be fighting on these custom field effects, so the Field Notes will be very helpful.

Before we continue with the story, there are a couple quests we can take care of now.

Go to the factory area where we first met Fern, and talk to the scientist guy on the right side of the factory. He will give us the *Factory Field Readout*, so now we have more details whenever we have battles on the Factory Field that was in Mosswater.

Head down and talk to the purple haired guy above the destroyed train station. A hotshot will steal his painkillers! Follow him inside the North Peridot Alley, where you can fight him.

Return to the purple haired guy in Lower Peridot, who will give you 5 *Exp. Candy S*. Nice.

## Grand Hall Trainers 1

Now is a good time to mention the Grand Hall repeatable grinding trainers in the top right corner. Each day of the week, different trainers will be available for grinding. At set points in the game, the trainers will get stronger and their rewards better. For now, each trainer will give you 2 *Exp. Candy S* when you defeat them, useful for bringing your levels up. The game will also heal your party after defeating one to save time! The trainers are as follows:

Use the trainers as you'd like to prepare for the gym.

By now hopefully you've been able to evolve your Bidoof into **Bibarel** at Lv. 15. If so, head into the house across from Mosswater, in Upper Peridot, to do an in-game trade for **Munna**!

## Volt Badge

Enter the Neo-Circuit Power-Plant gym when you're ready. The puzzle is simple: beat a trainer, talk to Voltorb, talk to the metal grate standing in your way.

Pokemon Reborn's first gym leader is live! Julia's team centers around two strategies: stacking Special Attack with Electric Terrain boosted Charge Beam, and wearing out your low maximum-HP Pokemon quickly with Sonic Boom. Her Electrode is very fast, and can employ both of these strategies effectively and then take out another chunk of HP on its way out with Aftermath. Geodude and Voltorb also like to explode, and since the former's is boosted by STAB, Galvanize, and the field... it's gonna hurt. Oricorio is on the team for coverage: it can hit hard and boost the speed of the entire team for a few turns, and also punishes your Grass-type starter.

Luckily, the team isn't super bulky, so trying to get something going with your own sweepers might be the key. Kricketune and Mightyena can really shine here, as well as your second stage starter especially with Torrent / Blaze / Overgrow. Elemental Seeds boost speed on this field, which can be key to getting momentum with your sweeper. *Reborn doesn't always force you to keep the default field around*, however: if you have Zigzagoon, you can use Mud Sport to destroy the Electric Terrain field entirely!

Once you emerge victorious, you'll be given the *Volt Badge* as well as *TM57 Charge Beam*. TMs are infinite-use, so feel free to slap it on anything that can learn it. You also get to go up to Lv. 25 now! Great job completing Episode 1 of Pokemon Reborn!

# Episode 2: Reap What's Been Sewn

Head outside, and talk to Victoria outside the gym. She'll tell us our next destination is to the east of the Grand Hall.

Before we continue though, there are a couple quests we can complete before we proceed to the next area.

## 1 Badge Quests

Head nearby the train station in Lower Peridot. While it is raining, if you have a snax in your bag you can give it away to get **Numel**!

Nearby you'll find a hiker. Talk to him, then talk to the person in the house containing Whismur earlier on. Return to the hiker and follow him to the house to receive **Onix**!

Next, enter the Grand Hall. The Common Candy salesman near the shop is now gone, but in his place is a person with glasses who will give us the *Rainbow Field Readout*. Keep this field in mind for later.

Now that we have a badge, Pokemarts will be updated:

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Default Mart (1 Badge)</strong></th></thead>
<tr>

Having a couple repels never hurts, but money is still scarce and catching them all is an expensive task, so I still recommend focusing mostly on balls.

You'll also notice that there are more trainers on Opal Bridge. Again clockwise:

## Obsidia Ward

When you're ready, talk to Victoria on the right side of Opal Bridge.

Head into the Central Salon. Inside, you'll find a friendship checker as well as a groomer who will raise your Pokemon's friendship for $1500. Do this once if you have the money.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Get at least one massage at the Central Salon (+1 Serra)

A lady on the right will ask to see a Pokemon with maximum friendship. Your starter is likely here by now if it's stayed in your party the whole game so far, you've done all the sidequests, and you haven't let it faint too much. If you do show her one, you'll get the *Soothe Bell*! Helpful if you want to accelerate the evolution of your Igglybuff, Woobat, etc.

The building to the right is Critical Capture, where you can buy custom balls.

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Critical Capture (Right)</strong></th></thead>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Heavy Ball</em></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Moon Ball</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$300</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Fast Ball</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$300</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Love Ball</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$400</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Nest Ball</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Net Ball</em></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Friend Ball</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$3000</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

Most of these are really not too worth it right now compared to the regular variety (especially Friend Ball... yikes) but I recommend picking up a few Love Balls - their 4x catch rate can be activated fairly easily on-genderless Pokemon, helpful for Pokemon with lower catch rates we may encounter.

Outside, head right and up.

Eventually, we will be freeing the real daycare couple! In a house to the left, we'll learn about an in-game trade we can't complete just yet. Head outside, and to the left, grab a hidden *Steel Gem* in the rock. Go down the stairs to access a new part of the railnet.

Klink is pretty good on the Factory Field, which we'll be seeing a lot in this game. There is also an *Escape Rope* hidden in the leftmost rock.

Head back out and enter the Devon Corp building on the main street.

Nothing special here for sale, but if you talk to the mysterious salesman, he'll give you a free *Premier Ball* the first time.

The next building in line is the Sweet Kiss Candy Shop building. In the top left corner, you can complete a puzzle to get **Swirlix**! The completed puzzle looks like this:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/swirlix.jpg"/>

At the top, a kid really wants some Vanilla Ice Cream. Since he's blocking the machine though we can't get any here - you'll have to wait until it's sunny and buy some from Opal Ward. Give it to this kid and then buy a Vanilla Ice Cream for $1000 from the vending machine - it will be a **Vanillite** in disguise! After this the vending machine will be normal again.

There is a 1% chance you will actually get a *Blue Moon Ice Cream* whenever you buy any one of these. Choc and Berry are more expensive here than in Opal Ward, so there's really no reason to buy these here ever.

</table></div>

If you're planning on evolving Swirlix, grab a Whipped Dream. We will eventually need another Whipped Dream for a quest. Cotton Candy functions as a Revive, but is very expensive. The rest are just expensive versions of the status healing items, but all raise friendship.

Since grinding trainers give them every time you beat them, you don't need to spend your precious money on Exp. Candy or the expensive Rare Candies.

Back outside, follow Victoria to the right. If you'd like to get to battle Victoria and potentially get a point with her in a bit, talk to Florinia.

To the left you'll find a Light Shard, which heals your party but disappears after.

If you talked to Victoria near the park earlier, head up and talk to Victoria for a battle. If you didn't or you want to skip her battle, talk to the fridge in the upper right corner to delete the barrier. Talk to the nearby trashcan to get a *PokeSnax*.

Her Torracat likes to try to set up on you, so be careful of that. Otherwise her team isn't anything too crazy - Ralts and Pichu are pretty weak and you can set up on them.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Victoria in the Slums (+1 Victoria)

After that's done, head down the escalator to the right. There are encounters in this area.

Head left and emerge onto the roof. There's another Light Shard here - usually they mean either "you're halfway through a dungeon" or "there's a super hard fight coming up". Anyways, follow the path and talk to Mankey in the elevator. Take it to 1F to open a shortcut, then take it to B1F.

Talk to the box in front of the elevator to watch it scurry away. Enter the elevator and go to 1F. Grab the *Net Ball* and talk to the kid here to make him move, opening a shortcut. In the elevator again, go to 2F to grab *TM60 Quash*. Quash!!!!!

Back on B1F, enter the big door and head up.

As long as you are able to bully Scrafty when it comes out you should be able to make this work with a team of six.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden019.png"/>

- (A): *Potion*
- (B): *Blue Shard*

Proceed to the next room.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden020.png"/>

- (A): *Potion*
- (B): *Exp. Candy S*

We're back in the large basement area for the third time. Lots of items to get here; follow the path down and to the right.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden021.png"/>

- (A): *Cotton Candy*, between escalators
- (B): *Burn Heal*
- (C): *Antidote*
- (D): *Cheri Berry*
- (E): *Super Potion*, not hidden
- (F): *Exp. Candy S*

This is a dead end without Rock Smash. Backtrack your way to the escalators and go up. Talk to the backpacker below to get the grate opened for a shortcut.

Immediately up and to the right, you'll find a box containing an *Awakening*. Head to the right and jump your way through this path, pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* and an *Antidote* in rocks on the right side, and go down. Here you'll find an abandoned egg. When it hatches it will be **Bronzor**, **Ducklett**, or **Drowzee**, determined randomly.

Backtrack to the previous room and follow the path up. Talk to the Spoink hiding under some beams here to begin a quest, then emerge into daylight!

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/hidden022.png"/>

Grab the hidden *Repel* (A) and enter Coral Ward at the bottom.

## Coral Ward

As a reward for completing the quiz you'll get the *Misty Terrain Readout*. Useful, since Coral Ward is covered in mist.

In a house below, there is an in-game trade. Raise your Patrat to Lv. 20 to get **Watchog**, then trade it for a **Nosepass**.

On the dock, if it is raining and you have Snax, you can obtain **Lotad**.

This one isn't too crazy. Notice that Popplio's Icy Wind is boosted by the field, so watch out if you were planning on using anything weak to Ice. Nidorino hits somewhat hard but a Steel type can wall it.

After the battle, you'll be given *TMX1 Cut*!

## Obsidia Park

Return to South Obsidia Ward and use your new field move to chop down the tree. Thankfully in this game an HM, or "TMX", can be deleted from your Pokemon at will.

Talk to the kid here - we will reunite him with his mother as soon as we can. Enter the Glazamonia Salon here. Furfrou can later be groomed here, they also offer massages for $2000. A lady here will ask us to investigate the Central Salon for them - we will do so later.

Back in Obsidia Ward, head up from here. You'll be back in the area in front of the park - we can actually access one more side area before we proceed into the park. At the left end of the ward, down from the Cafe Salon, cut down the tree and go south.

At the top of the area during the morning and day, you'll find a Litleo, who will run off.

To the left of the area, a **Minun** or a **Plusle** will pop out and join you if you give it snax. You can get both by exiting and re-entering.

If this is a bit too hard for now feel free to skip this one, but if you enter the Underground Railnet from the Obsidia entrance you'll find Litleo and have to fight a strong Pokemon.

With all that out of the way, return to the park area and talk to Victoria, Amaria, and Florinia. Head into Obsidia Park. Note that once we are done here we can't re-enter, so if you want the hidden items and such grab them while we're here. All of the Pokemon will be available later, though.

Back down from here, follow the yellow path to the left. In the second rock you'll find an *Antidote* (H). Use the Light Shard if you'd like, then prepare for a battle!

This is our first battle with a PULSE! For this, and all custom Pokemon forms in this game, I provide a reference for base stats, typing, and other data [in the appendices](#custom-pokemon-form-lookup). The Field Notes app in game also has you covered, minus specific numbers.

As you can see from its stats, Tangrowth is pretty slow, which luckily means you can take the chance to cripple it with paralysis or stat debuffs. It doesn't hit ridiculously hard either, so your Pokemon will likely be able to live a few turns before being knocked out, but you do have to be cautious of field-boosted Grass moves. The difficulty lies in its combination of Acid Spray and Mega Drain, as it likes to weaken you then heal back to full. Making sure that you're dealing more damage than it is able to heal will be the key here.

Once you succeed, the vines will recede and we'll be back in the park.

Our Pokemon have been getting random EV's so far - if you in the future want to EV train your Pokemon, you can buy these to make the process easier. In Reborn, 20 EVs per berry are lowered instead of the canon 10. Don't worry about them for now - EV training will become a lot easier later on.

Make your way down and left to the Obsidia Pokemon Center and talk to the mom inside. Tell her where her son is to get an *Ability Capsule*!

If you're interested in a trade, evolve Sentret we got earlier by raising it to Lv. 15 to get **Furret**. In the house left from the Pokemon Center, you can trade it to get **Castform**!

Take another visit to the Central Salon and talk to the people inside. Then return to the Glamazonia Salon and talk to the lady, who'll let you take home **Glameow**. They'll also lower their massage price to $1400. That's not all for this quest though, no. Take your Glameow to the Central Salon and show it to the lady on the right; she'll allow us to battle her.

Obviously this is a pretty tough fight for this point in the game, feel free to return to it later. Maybe a fire type might be able to lower its stats or something since it resists both of its attack moves?

If you're able to win, you'll get **Bounsweet**!

That's pretty much all we can do in Obsidia for now, but before we continue the story we can take a brief detour back to Coral Ward for some goodies.

The warehouse key we got earlier works on three of the warehouses here. In the left one, you'll find the real daycare couple! By freeing them, the daycare will now be in service for all your Pokemon breeding needs.

The second warehouse contains a *Macho Brace* as well as **Spoink** randomly hiding in one of the boxes. The third warehouse contains a Meteor Grunt. Talking to him allows us to get a Pokemon later on. Also in here is a **Happiny**!

## Onyx Ward

Head up into Onyx Ward from the northeastern corner of Obsidia. Onyx Ward is pretty small, but there are some things we can do here before challenging the gym.

First, we'll do a counter-clockwise loop of the area. Trainers include:

It's worth noting that every tutor in the game will only charge you once per move - so don't feel bad about deleting a tutor move once you've learned it once since you can go get it back for free.

Fern can be tough to defeat now that his Budew and Rowlet have evolved. Roselia likes to try to tank your attacks and heal back thanks to Leech Seed and Mega Drain, while Dartrix tries to hit hard with its STABs or go for an omniboost. Sandile can sweep with Moxie if you're not careful, so lead with something that can handle it and you should be fine.

Before we continue to the gym, now is a good time to wrap up a couple of quests and areas.

First, head on over to the Arcade. With our Coin Case, we can now go to town here. Note that by interacting with NPC's and random tiles throughout, you can pick up 1205 Coins for free.

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Onyx Arcade Coins</strong></th></thead>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>50 Coins</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$1000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>500 Coins</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$10000</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

Unless you're coming back here really late in the game, don't buy coins. They're way too expensive, and starting with the free coins you can get up to the magic number needed to get all the rewards: 23900 coins.

You can play the slots, roulette, or Voltorb Flip. Previous versions of the guide recommended Voltorb Flip to grind all your coins, but I've since realized that the fastest strategy by far is the 100 coin Roulette board.

All you need to do is save before playing the board, pick any spot (12x payout), and play all seven balls. Note that you need to switch to a new spot if you get a jackpot on your current pick. Reset if you don't get a single jackpot on any of the seven balls, otherwise, save after all seven balls have been played. Even if you only hit one spot, you'll net 500 coins per round, a payout which only gets better the more jackpots you manage to get. You'll reach your target in no time.

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Onyx Arcade TMs</strong></th></thead>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>TM45 Attract</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">1000 Coins</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>TM90 Substitute</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">7000 Coins</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

These TMs have very wide pools of candidates, so grabbing them will generally be helpful in the early game when your movesets aren't complete yet.

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Onyx Arcade Pokemon</strong></th></thead>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Snover</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">600 Coins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Slugma</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">1000 Coins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Mantyke</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">1800 Coins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Nidoran M</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">3500 Coins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Shinx</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">5000 Coins</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

All of these Pokemon have something going for them:

- If the egg we previously got was Remoraid, you can get Mantyke and immediately evolve it into Mantine, which is really overpowered at this point in the game.
- Nidoran M also can immediately evolve twice with the Moon Stone we got earlier, and Nidoking tears through this part of the game.
- Snover can generate Snow Warning, our first weather ability.
- Slugma
- Shinx is one of the first Intimidate users we can get and evolves quickly.

Back outside, head into the building to the left. Fern's friend will feel bad and let us access the rooftop garden. Up here you'll find *TM63 Embargo*.

When the weather is clear up here, you can also find a **Pichu** behind a tree if you have snax in your bag.

There is another event we can do, but it only works on certain weekday nights. For now, we have access to three alleyways. You'll need to go to any one of the following:

- Obsidia Alleyway, on a Monday night
- North Peridot Alleyway, on a Thursday night
- Lower Peridot Alleyway, on a Friday night

Whichever you go to at the right time, you'll find a **Zangoose** digging through the trash that you can catch.

Finally, now is a good time to go finish the search for Lillipup.

After talking to it in the apartment in South Obsidia Ward it will randomly go to one of these five places:

- On the second pier from the top in Coral Ward
- To the left and up from the Central Salon in Obsidia Ward
- Between the Panpour / Pansear area and the Railnet in Opal Ward
- At the very north point of Peridot Ward by the closed gate
- In the northwest corner of Peridot Ward, nearby the apartment containing Snubbull / Stufful

Once you find it, head back to the Onyx Ward. To the left of the Move Relearner house, you'll see the owner with it. You can then obtain **Lillipup**.

## Rainbow Scent Quest

One more large sidequest has now opened up! This is a limited-time quest, so its best to get started on it now. If the battles are a bit too hard for now, the final time you can complete this quest is immediately after defeating the Bug-type gym leader.

Head down to the Obsidia Park area. Talk to the pink-haired girl if you are ready for a battle.

Combee and Venonat are fairly weak, allowing you to get set up. This is also our first encounter with Enemy Z-Moves: Pineco is holding the Buginium-Z.

Laura tells us that she is looking for three Pokemon with flowers on their bodies. Talk to her again to learn there is a Comfey with a gentleman somewhere in Peridot Ward. Head over to the Upper Peridot Alleyway when you are ready for a little gauntlet...

Because these are all separate battles, you can't set up and steamroll the gauntlet. A fast Flying or Psychic type will probably be your best bet here if they can OHKO, though a full team of six can probably take down three Pokemon if the matchups are favorable enough.

After the scenes have concluded, you can get **Comfey**! Add this to your party and take it to Laura in Obsidia Park.

Laura wants to check out three Pokemon total: this Comfey works as one of them. Two more can be pulled from the following list: Ivysaur, Venusaur, Gloom, Vileplume, Bellossom, Meganium, Skiploom, Cherrim, Maractus, Roselia, Roserade, Flabebe, Floette, Florges, Shaymin, Aromatisse, Munna, Deerling, Sawsbuck (Spring), Wormadam (Plant), and Lilligant. At this point in the game though, we don't have most of these: unless you picked Bulbasaur as a starter, the easiest Pokemon to get at this point are **Gloom**, **Roselia**, and **Skiploom**, all obtained via evolution.

Completing this quest rewards you with the *Rainbow Scent*, an item that controls the rate at which wild Pokemon are attracted to you, as well as a **Petilil**!

## Grand Hall Trainers 2

After defeating Julia, the trainers in the Grand Hall have gotten stronger. Defeating them will now yield 4 *Exp. Candy S*! The updated teams are as follows:

This is a pretty neat and out of the ordinary team that helps teach the player about the versatility of field effects. In general, the Desert Field actually doesn't really benefit Grass types or most grass type moves. Regardless, Florinia's team is mostly built around using the field successfully. Specifically, most of her team have at least one of Needle Arm, Pin Missile, and Sand Tomb, which are all boosted by the field. Cacnea's Sand Veil is always activated here, and Ferroseed's Telluric Seed allows it to gain a bit more bulk and speed in exchange for being trapped by Sand Tomb. Sandstorm lasts for eight turns on the field, and Ferroseed, Cacnea, and Cradily will all be immune to its damage while you may not. Cradily also gets a Special Defense boost from the sand, adding to its already strong bulk with Stockpile and Recover. On top of all that, Nature Power turns into boosted Sand Tomb, and Cottonee has priority with this move due to Prankster!

All that goes to show how even fields that aren't as *obviously* beneficial like Electric Terrain for Julia can lead to difficult challenges. Aside from Pin Missile Linoone you don't really have many options to get boosts from the field yourself yet, so the key will be to overwhelming her otherwise. Fury Cutter is a pretty great move for this fight - you can get around Ferroseed's Iron Barbs with the Protective Pads we found earlier, and after a few uses the move will tear through Cradily before it can bulk up. Snover is also a good option if you want to cancel out the Sandstorm with a different weather condition, or you could use Sunny Day with Castform or Cherrim to sweep with Fire moves under the 8-turn Desert Field sun. You could also try to run a Flying type offensive core, which ignores Sand Tomb and can pretty easily deal with everything except Cradily. A great example of having to think outside the box in Reborn; you can do it!

After winning you'll get the *Canopy Badge* as well as *TM96 Nature Power*. You'll also receive the *PULSE Dex* as well as the *PULSE Readout 5C*. The level cap also shoots up to 35!

# Episode 3: Domino

Exit Florinia's Arena. There are a few things we can do now that we have 2 badges before we continue the story.

## 2 Badge Quests

First, head to the room containing the nurse in the Trainer School. A girl towards the left side will trade you battle advice for *TM100 Confide*!

Now that we have 2 badges, the Pokemarts and candy store have updated inventory now:

</table></div>

Head into the Obsidia Slums. Nearby where we first entered on the first floor, you'll see a doctor talking to a child. Talk to him to get the *Itemfinder*! Note that this is a limited time event, so if you don't want to have to wait until we get four more badges to get the Itemfinder, act now! Since I assume you can use the itemfinder now, going forward in this guide, I will not describe exact locations of hidden items. You'll also find an *Exp. Candy M* here.

Head left and take the elevator down to B1F. Immediately head left and go up, following the path. If you have snax in your bag, you can catch **Makuhita**!

Back in Opal Ward, specifically if you randomly got Clamperl earlier in Onyx Ward, a person near the water at the bottom will give you a *Deep Sea Tooth* or a *Deep Sea Scale*, randomly determined.

There is also a new trainer on the Opal Bridge:

Finally, head to the apartment in the top left corner of Peridot Ward. Now that we have two badges we can finally take home **Snubbull** or **Stufful**, randomly determined.

## Jasper Ward & Malchous Forest Park

Leave this house, and head into the Jasper gate to your right. Talk to the guard here and head into Jasper Ward.

<td style="text-align: center">4%</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

It's worth noting that when we have like 11 more badges we will eventually want a Carnivine for an in-game trade.

Talk to Corey and Heather here, then head into the police station. Talk to the chief here, who will tell you about his missing officers. You don't have to find them, but doing so is the first step to doing the more exclusive postgame story route. If you'd like to play the route of the game that involves not finding the officers in time, you can skip finding one of the officers until you complete up to the end of this section, then find them afterwards to get the quest rewards.

In general, I will mention story splits and how choices affect post-game route availability just so you can keep your options open.

Outside, you'll find a Meteor Grunt to the right.

Head towards the center of the area, and chop the wiggly tree nearby. Following the path that this opens up below, you can grab hidden *X Speed*, *Full Heal*, and *Telluric Seed*. Chop the wiggly tree to the right nearby and receive a *Super Potion* from Heather, then chop the wiggly tree immediately to the left.

From here, backtrack to the entrance of the forest. Go up and left, choosing to go left instead of climbing the two-tile wide set of stairs. Follow this path up and climb three sets of stairs: you'll see a Meteor Grunt here.

Down from here you'll find some stairs leading to some grunts - but there is a secret passageway hidden to the left behind a tree. Follow this path to get a hidden *Revive* and *Exp. Candy S* as well as an egg. When it hatches it will be **Deerling**, **Skiddo**, **Girafarig**, or **Nincada**, randomly determined. Head back from here and fight the grunts.

Go right and down from here. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and the *PULSE Readout 5B*.

Head back up, talk to Heather for a heal, then climb the vines on the nearby pillar, hop over to the main building, and head in. Jump on down. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and *Exp. Candy M* (missable if you don't grab them right now). Head up for a battle.

Taka will fight you on the Rocky Field. We don't have the notes for this field yet, but you will observe that Rock Tomb will be stronger here. The Telluric Seed can be helpful here: by testing it you'll notice that it raises Defense but does Stealth Rock damage. Since Exeggcute doesn't hit that hard you can take the chance to set up offenses on it, then you can hit the slow PULSE Tangrowth hard. Also, this entire team is weak to Ice.

After the battle, you'll be sent outside. Answer Corey how you like here, then grab hidden *X Defend* and *Green Shard* as well as a *Big Root*.

Exit Malchous Forest Park in the top right corner. In the first house, you'll find a grunt.

Defeat him to free Police Officer #1. In the building next door, head up to 5F via the elevator, and talk to the girl inside so she'll leave.

Head back to the main part of Jasper via the bottom right exit of Malchous. On your way back to the Pokemon Center area, you can now grab a hidden *PokeSnax*.

Past the Pokemon Center, enter the first building you see. Talk to the guy here to activate a quest. You can also enter the elevator room here to get the *Forest Field Readout*.

Outside, you can now grab a *Paralyze Heal* and save Police Officer #2. Grab a hidden *Super Potion* and *Green Shard* outside and head into the small building here. If you have snax and talked to the panicking guy earlier, you can get **Mareep**!

Before we continue into the next ward, there's a quick thing we can do. Exit Jasper Ward to the south (there's a shortcut below the Mareep building) and head to the right. Enter the first house you see in Peridot Ward, and talk to the girls inside for *Department Store Sticker: Tangela* as well as *TM88 Sleep Talk*.

Since money is still tight, I wouldn't recommend binging too many of these items for now, especially since most of them suck. We'll be able to get tons of the weather extending rocks, Iron Ball, and Light Clay after the next badge for free, but if your strategy involves weather or screens they are pretty cheap right now so it might be worth it for those.

Back in Jasper, return to the top-right corner and head up to access the next ward.

## Rhodochrine Jungle & The Underroot

Enter the Beryl Ward. We can't really explore much of this ward itself right now. Head to the right to access the Beryl Bridge. Hidden on the bridge you'll find a *Heart Scale*, *X Speed*, and *PokeSnax*.

While it is windy, at the end of the bridge you can catch **Drifloon**! Talk to the kid here and he will go home.

Back in Beryl, head left.

Catch a Ledian for an in-game trade later, and a Farfetch'd to trade for a fossil later on as well.

Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* here, then head up and get a hidden *Rawst Berry* and *Rare Candy*, being careful to avoid stepping on the suspicious patch of grass. Head down and to the left, you'll see Meteor Grunts. You'll actually have a choice now on how to proceed - you can either step on the suspicious patch of grass or step on tall grass near the grunts to end up in a trap, or carefully sneak around the grunts and head up.

The jungle is huge, so I explain the results of this choice first, guide both routes to the same location, then explore the jungle after this convergence.

### Cage Trap Route

If you were trapped in a cage, read on, otherwise, [jump to the next section](#snuck-around-route).

Roughly, you'll want to follow the blue path in the following image:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/cagepath.png"/>

You'll wake up in a cage and Fern will taunt you here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reject begging Fern (-1 Fern)
- Beg Fern once, then reject him (Neutral)
- Beg Fern twice, then reject him (+1 Fern)
- Beg Fern three times, then reject him (+2 Fern)
- Beg Fern four times (+5 Fern)

If you do reject him, eventually you will be let out anyways.

Head up and to the right to free Cain from his cage.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Freed Cain from the cage (+1 Cain)

Head down from here and talk to the lever. Heather will show up and pull the switch to activate these bridges.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Got stuck in a cage (-1 Heather)

Head east from here, and go slightly south once you reach a Meteor Grunt. Continue south until you hit a Gentleman, then go straight east and follow the path up the hill via stairs. The house here is a healing house, should you need it.

### Snuck Around Route

If you managed to carefully sneak around the grunts, read on, otherwise [jump to the next section](#exploring-the-jungle).

Head up the stairs on the right, and you'll find Fern.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talked to Fern atop the hill (+1 Fern)

The building to your right is a healing house, should you need it.

### Exploring the Jungle

All players following along should now be in the same place: next to the healing house.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/rhodo1.png"/>

Itemfind here for an *Exp. Candy S* then head down the hill, pick up hidden *Full Heal* and go down from here. The grunts around the fire will be gone now, so you can pick up a hidden *Guard Spec* to the west.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/rhodo2.png"/>

Head back up and go left. Here you'll see a gentleman.

In this area you can find a hidden *Liechi Berry* and *Great Ball*. To the right of the grunt, climb the hill and chop a wiggly tree.

On this next hill you can obtain a hidden *X Speed*. Climbing stairs to the northeast will lead to a hidden *Antidote*. We'll get to the cave entrance at the top of this area later, for now, sneak around the building in the bottom left and pick up a hidden *Dark Gem*. You can actually enter the felled building to the right, inside you'll find *TM77 Psych Up*.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/rhodo4.png"/>

Back outside, head up the ramp to the left and pick up the hidden *Green Shard*. Cross the wooden bridge to the left and head up. Here you can find a hidden *Salac Berry*, *Paralyze Heal*, and an *Antidote*. Head back down the stairs but this time follow the narrow path up and to the right. You'll cross a bridge over land here, grab a hidden *Blue Shard* and carefully pick up the *PULSE Readout 5A* without stepping on the shifty 2-by-2 patch of land. *After* you grab the readout, step on the trap.

This brings us to the Underroot - but we will explore this area fully in a little bit. For now, grab the hidden *Exp. Candy S* in a rock to the right, jump down the ledge and take the stairs here to return to a familiar part of the jungle.

Our next move is going to be to head all the way back to the healing house from earlier by going down, right at the gentleman, then up the hill to the right. Heal if you'd like.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/rhodo5.png"/>

Go straight down from here and follow the path across the bridge.

Grab a hidden *Blue Shard* as you make your way left. Head up as soon as you can, here is a Light Shard and a building. Inside, you'll find a PC as well as a in-game trade: your Sunkern for either **Carbink**, **Mime Jr.**, **Cryogonal**, or **Furfrou**, determined randomly. Perhaps more importantly, it will be holding the *Exp. Share*!

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/rhodo6.png"/>

Head outside and follow the path left. You'll find a hidden *Red Shard*. At the next fork, go up, where you'll find a hidden *Super Potion* and a *Telluric Seed*. Take the other path of the fork now.

You'll find a hidden *Calcium* here. Head to the left across the bridge and pick up an *Exp. Candy M*. Specifically on sunny days, you can battle and catch **Tropius** here as well. It's very strong for this point in the game, so be careful.

Head back across the bridge, and from here go down to find a hidden *Purple Shard* and a *Great Ball*. That pretty much covers the part of the jungle we have been able to access for now, so it's time to explore the Underroot. Nearby you'll see a trap spot on the ground, step on it to fall in.

### Exploring the Underroot

Hidden here is an *Exp. Candy S*. We can't do anything with these glowy rocks for a while, so head out of this area.

Head to the right first. You'll find a hidden *Chesto Berry* here. Take the nearby stairs to reach a new area of the jungle. You can find a hidden *Red Shard* and *Exp. Candy S* here. You can also battle and catch **Taillow** at the top.

Back in the Underroot, take the path up from here and cut the wiggly tree. Take the nearby stairs to access another section of jungle. Go up here to find a hidden *Ether* and **Stantler**.

Follow the path all the way down and to the right. Inside a house here is a lady. She will tutor us a pretty good move... but only if you have a Grass type starter. Since Grass type starters kinda suck compared to Fire type and Water type starters, here's a bit of compensation.

Defeat him to free Police Officer #3.

Back in the Underroot, go up and grab a hidden *Purple Shard*. To the left you'll find a hidden *Exp. Candy S* and a stationary **Seviper**.

Up and to the right you can get a hidden *Energy Root* and *Red Shard*, and free Police Officer #4. Head down and pass under the waterfall to the right. Head right for a hidden *Dire Hit* and *Poke Ball*. Back left from here, head up. This was an area we visited earlier - you can access the main part of the jungle via these stairs.

Still in the Underroot, head down from here and take the stairs downward on the east side of the waterfall. Hug the left wall as you go down. You'll find a *Potion*, *Blue Shard*, *Energy Powder*, *Heavy Ball*, and an *Elemental Seed* on the ground. Use the Light Shard if you need it and head back up.

At the first fork, now go to the right. Grab a hidden *Oran Berry* and a *Hyper Potion* on the ground. Back up from here, take a right at the next fork.

Go to the right when you can, get a hidden *Ice Heal*, and continue right to emerge into the jungle once more.

### Finishing Up in the Jungle

Head out and to the right, and you'll actually pop out in Beryl Ward. There is a hidden *Super Potion* and a *PP Up* here. Head into this library.

You can walk on the tops of bookshelves in here, do so to get *TM20 Safeguard* in the bottom-left corner as well as the *Corrosive Field Readout*. Enter the door on the right. Inside you'll find an *Ill-Fated Doll* and by talking to Growlithe and then the crevasse you find will find out what happened to Police Officer #5. Reading on the job: never again.

Enter the left room of the library if you'd like. Inside you'll meet a man.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Radomus in the library (+1 Radomus)

Back outside, chop the tree to your left and enter the felled building.

Re-enter the jungle to the left. Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy S* and *Burn Heal*. You can talk to Amaria here, the second time she'll heal your party even.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Amaria in the jungle (+1 Amaria)

Cut down the wiggly tree nearby, then head back through the path through Beryl by the library, the jungle, and the underroot to return to the healing house in the eastern side of the jungle. It's time to finish up in this area. 

**NOTE: Reborn has multiple story splits throughout the game. There are multiple routes in the postgame based on decisions in the main game - one of these routes is more exclusive. That said, you actually get MORE story and context in the "normal" postgame route, so I personally recommend pursuing the exclusive route only on a second playthrough. Though for completion, I will still list all of the prerequisites for entering this route throughout this guide.**

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to save all five officers by this point.**

Prepare your team as necessary, and head up.

Finally we get to battle Meteor's Ace themselves. I wish there was a way to not spoil the surprise of their first Pokemon in this guide, but that Pokemon and many more on their team have Grass moves that feed off of the terrain's 1.5x boost. Braixen can steal your items and hit pretty hard with Psybeam and Fire Spin, and Roselia, as we've seen with Fern, is a hard hitting and healing monster in the early game. Be extra careful with the ultimate PULSE Tangrowth: it likes to get boosts from double-strength Growth and Stamina, then hit hard with Stored Power.

One thing to consider is that, past Braixen, a Bug type can do pretty well here against their team, especially a special attacker or one with Swarm. Cut will also hit for double damage on Roselia and Tangrowth. If you're holding a Telluric Seed, it gives you a free Spiky Shield on its holder's first turn, so in a pinch you can abuse that to set up one of your own Pokemon so that Tangrowth goes down before it can boost too much. Or, you can simply use Slugma or Numel to transform the field to Burning and watch the majority of their team burn passively each turn.

Once you win, you can find a hidden *Super Repel* in the next area. Head down. Here, you'll see a scene involving Corey.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Find all five officers before fighting Ace (+1 Heather, +1 Anna, +1 Shade)

## Beryl Ward & Beryl Cemetery

With that out of the way, we now can actually explore the main part of Beryl Ward.

Before we do anything else, talk to the backpacker nearby a dumpster down from the Pokemart. If you give him $5000 he will give you the *Magnetic Lure*, an amazing item that, when equipped by your party leader, guarantees you will encounter a Pokemon you haven't caught yet in an area. No more do you have to aimlessly wander around an area looking for that 4% encounter!

Nearby, on clear days, you'll find another snax vendor.

Enter the building up and to the left from this guy. On a sunny day, go onto the rooftop to be able to obtain **Helioptile** in exchange for some snax. Inside the Pokemon center, an NPC will tell you a password: *easyhms*.

Around the town, you can find 2 hidden *Blue Shards*, *Escape Rope*, *Fighting Gem*, *Potion*, *Red Shard*, and *HP Up*. 

Continuing to the left into the cemetery area, you can find hidden *Elemental Seed* and *Poke Ball*.

Next, we're gonna head back through the jungle to get to the library. In the left room you can find a *TwistedSpoon*. Could be useful soon.

Back in the jungle, explore around the area where we fought Ace. You'll find a hidden *Petaya Berry*, *Red Shard* as well as a *Great Ball*.

That about wraps up everything we can do for now, so head to the top of the hill in Beryl.

## VS. Agent Borealis

Head into the gym.

As you can probably tell from the Corrosive Field notes, you'll be worn down by Poison type entry damage. Grass types have a really rough time here, and many special Ground moves otherwise super-effective against his team are cancelled out by a Poison type modifier. Thankfully half of his team isn't too dreadful: Skrelp and Nidorina don't hit too hard, and Croagunk isn't too threatening aside from his priority Sucker Punch. Mareanie hits hard with Merciless and Venoshock both always activated, but it's slow and not too bulky. His Skuntank however can hit decently hard by stacking Acid Sprays, and with its bulk, it can be a threat. You also need to be careful of Aftermath, which can knock out your sweeper. Most difficult of all is his Crobat, since it outspeeds almost every Pokemon you can have by this point and hits like a truck on this field with activated Venoshock.

The key here is putting yourself in a position to be able to deal with Crobat. Thankfully, it's frail enough to die to one or two strong super-effective hits, so by either raising your speed or sending in something with some bulk, you may find success. Your own Poison types and Steel types are immune to a lot of the field's shenanigans, hence are good options. Psychic types are good as long as you can play around Sucker Punch. As long as you aren't going with Mud Shot and Mud Bomb, Ground types can be good at sweeping the weaker members of the team. You can also try to use the field to your advantage to some extent: Sleep Powder becomes 100% accurate here, and the Telluric Seed gives any Pokemon a free turn of protect. Unfortunately unless you're using your own Poison type strategies there isn't really much else you can do to exploit this field yourself, so bring a strong team and you can prevail.

The Corrosive Mist Field notes explain that your non Poison and Steel types will be Poisoned by the field. Your special flying moves and bubble-based attacks will be nerfed against him as well. Thankfully half of his team isn't too dreadful: Skrelp and Nidorina don't hit too hard, and Croagunk isn't too strong, though it's Sucker Punch does have priority. Mareanie hits hard with Merciless and Venoshock exploiting your team being poisoned, but it is slow and not too bulky. However, Skuntank can hit decently hard by stacking Acid Sprays and hitting with boosted Flamethrower, and with its bulk it can stick around for a bit. It's Aftermath ability can also knock out your sweeper, so be careful. The biggest threat on his team is Crobat: it outspeeds almost every Pokemon you can have by this point and hits like a truck on this field with activated Venoshock. If you let it boost with Nasty Plot, it's very hard to win from there.

On this field, you really have to go fast so you're not worn down by Poison. On top of this, your goal has to be finding a way to deal with Crobat, since it likes to revenge kill your Pokemon that have already taken tons of Poison damage and sweep. However, it's frail enough to die to one or two well strong super-effective hits, so keeping a sturdy Rock, Electric, Ice, or Psychic type in the back holding the Atk/SpA boosting Elemental Seed may lead you to success. Your own Poison types and Steel types are immune to a lot of the field's shenanigans, hence are good options. Psychic types are good as long as you can play around Sucker Punch. I recommend using Fire moves since they're boosted by the field - only Skrelp and Mareanie resist them and they can hit hard in the right circumstances. A unique thing you can do is exploit the fact that Incinerate, Flame Burst, and Self-Destruct will knock out both active Pokemon and switch you to Corrosive Field (suggestions for that, if needed, are in the previous subsection), so if you are having trouble with Crobat or Skuntank you can send in a full health Slugma or Numel and try to do a kill from the grave.

# Episode 4: Aftershocks

No gym badge or TM is awarded to you after this fight.

To continue the story, you can either head to Beryl Bridge and watch the intense scene, or make your way south through Jasper to Peridot to skip it. Regardless our next story destination will be the North Obsidia Ward, but there are some very worthwhile quests we can do in the meantime.

## The Mystery Egg and Other Quests

First, after the events at the bridge, enter Corey's gym and enter his bedroom area. Here you'll find the *Silver Ring*, which will help us get some familiar Pokemon! Speaking of which, make your way to the Underroot and head to the bottom right section, then go left and up to reach the large pool in the center. You'll find a **Skrelp** here who will see the Silver Ring and join your team.

Next, head to the Beryl Library. Talk to the Gothitelle here, then pick up trash and stray books all around the library by spamming the action button. Once you finish, talk to Gothitelle for a *Soul Candle*. You can also talk to one of the **Gothita** to obtain it.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Clean up the Library (+1 Adrienn)

Head on over to the Beryl Cemetery at night. Talk to one of the pumpkins with a Soul Candle in your bag and you can catch **Pumpkaboo**.

An NPC in both sides of the Jasper Ward will sell Repels.

</table></div>

Head down into Jasper Ward and go left. You'll see a kid being bullied by some Venipede and Scolipede.

</table></div>

Defeat them, and the kid will head back to his home.

Next, it's time for the big one. Head back to the Jasper Police Station and talk to the chief, then talk to the female **Growlithe**. That alone is a decent reward, but we can take this Growlithe and any male Pokemon in its egg group to the daycare to produce an egg. Bring an egg back to the police station and we can trade it with the guy at the bottom to get what the community calls the Mystery Egg.

The Mystery Egg can actually hatch to be one of 18 different Pokemon - all of which are pretty solid team members in an early-game scenario where a lot of the available Pokemon suck. You'll get one of the following, randomly determined: **Azurill**, **Mareanie**, **Staryu**, **Togepi**, **Sneasel**, **Shroomish**, **Gastly**, **Axew**, **Vulpix-Alola**, **Pawniard**, **Litwick**, **Trapinch**, **Cottonee**, **Vulpix**, **Elekid**, **Starly**, **Rockruff**, **Larvesta**

We can get the other 17 at a later time.

## North Obsidia Ward

With that taken care of, we're going back to Opal Ward to head up at the bridge. You'll enter North Obsidia Ward.

Enter a small house on the left side of the ward and talk to a guy to get *TM21 Frustration*. In the Pokemart to your right, talk to a guy with a hood to get *TM07 Hail*.

Finally some good things for sale in this building. The Power Items raise 32 EV's per defeated Pokemon and cancel out other EV's. Meaning if you catch a new Pokemon you simply have to defeat any 8 Pokemon with a Power Item to max out - or 17 total for a usual 252/252/4 spread. This is so incredibly fast that there is virtually no reason not to EV train in this game given how tough the fights can be. These are probably a bit too pricey for us right now, but keep in mind that they're here so when we have the cash we can immediately max out our EV's. If you're planning on breeding you can get a Destiny Knot.

Anyways, that's all we can do in Lapis for now, so head to the North Obsidia Ward.

## The Grand Stairway

Talk to Cain here, and he will distract an officer so you can slip by.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to the guard 4 times while Cain is distracting him (-1 Cain)

You can find a hidden *Rock Gem* on the stairs. Head on down the ladder. You can find a *Green Shard* hidden in this first area. Head down the stairs again.

Pick up a hidden *Red Shard* and a *Dire Hit* to the right. Below here, you'll notice that there are some ledges we can hop down. If you hop down exactly four times, you can find a hidden *Focus Sash* here. Consider saving this for a situation that you really need it.

Down from here there are essentially four paths we can take down the ledges. I start by heading down the rightmost path first. Pick up a hidden *Guard Spec* then take the ladder. In the next room you can grab a hidden *Star Piece* then head into the small cave here.

"The Crystals glimmer with fissures" is a clue related to field effects - see if you can figure it out.

Once you do so, you can grab the *Crystal Cavern Field Readout*. Head back out then go up the ladder at the top. You can find a hidden *Heart Scale* as well as a *Magical Seed* and a *Exp. Candy M*. Can't do anything else here so head up the next ladder. In here you can pick up an *Ability Capsule* and hidden *Exp. Candy M* and *Red-Hots*.

You'll notice that we're back on B1F, so head back down the ladder below to reach the ledges on B2F. This time we are going to take the ledges down to go all the way to the left. You'll reach a ladder. Upstairs, you can find a hidden *Ground Gem* and *Super Repel*. Head down the ledge - again we'll find ourselves at the familiar area of B1F.

Head down to the sequence of ledges again. This time we will take the second-path from the left. Use your itemfinder as you're going down and you can obtain a *Green Shard*. Head to the left and go straight up. A guy will give you 3 *Exp. Candy M*. Nearby is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Go down the first set of stairs from here. You'll see a little pool of water coming out of the wall - head to the left from here, past some rocks to the left, to obtain *TM69 Rock Polish*! Head back down until you can go to the right. Climb these stairs - you'll find a hidden *Psychic Gem*, *X Speed*, and *PokeSnax* along the way.

Finally, we can take the huge series of ledges to take the third path from the left. Grab the hidden *X Sp. Atk* then head down the ladder here.

Their four rock types have their attacks boosted on the field. They're all pretty fast, especially Midday Lycanroc, so you have to have a bit of bulk to live. With the help of Victoria's fighting type moves though you will probably be able to find a way through this with a team of six.

You can accept Victoria's fast travel request afterwards. Back in North Obsidia Ward, Victoria will request that you battle her.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say No to Victoria's battle request (-1 Victoria)

Since last time, Victoria has evolved some of her team, but she shouldn't be too much of a threat if you've been able to defeat all the gym leaders to this point. She has a bit of diversity on her team: Kirlia and Pikachu can hit moderately hard with their STAB Special moves. Torracat will dampen your physical sweeper and fight get some lucky flinches with Bite or Fire Fang. Ultimately, you can probably find a way to set up on Pancham or just overwhelm her in a 6v4.

This is part of another gauntlet: time for another battle right after, though you do get healed.

Since last time, Fern has evolved his Roselia into Roserade, picked up a Rhyhorn, and evolved his Sandile. Thankfully, Rhyhorn and Dartrix aren't too incredible and each have exploitable 4x weaknesses. You don't want to let Krokorok sweep you, but it isn't too strong until it gets it's first boost, so a good switch can help against it. The big threat here is 31 IV Roserade - it's really fast and likes to pickup one-shots with Giga Drain and heal off whatever damage you've managed to get on it. Thankfully Rhyhorn isn't really a threat to most Pokemon, so the key to this fight is figuring out how to put yourself in a position to knock out Roserade before it comes out.

After winning, you'll be given *TMX7 Rock Smash*. We can't use it in the field yet, however.

Head to the nightclub up and to the right. You'll see a guy outside who you can talk to.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Meet DJ Arclight outside the nightclub (+1 Arclight)

Head back to Lapis Ward and attempt to enter the gym. Time for a battle!

The game forces rain on the overworld before this fight, so Drought Torkoal will cause it to be a Rainbow Field battle for eight turns. This makes Nature Power turn into boosted Aurora Beam, interestingly giving Ice type coverage to a Fire monotype team. Anyways, his team is fairly strong for this point under sun, so you're gonna have to be careful not to let his Houndoom and Magmortar destroy you with powered up Fire moves. The Rainbow field will also increase chances to burn, so your physical attackers may become crippled. One strategy you can use is changing the weather to something else; Rain will dampen his attacks, while the other two will cancel the Rainbow Field and deal chip damage. If you can knock out Torkoal he has no way to set up Sun after the first time, so you can use the Protect and Substitute TMs we now have to stall out the sun if you need to.

Head into the gym and go upstairs. Talk to the group here, then head outside and attempt to enter the orphanage in the center of Lapis Ward. A girl will leave. Head in. Inside, you'll have to defeat an Orderly.

After you leave, head back to the gym and go upstairs. We have our next main mission: challenging Shelly for a badge. We can talk to Victoria here as well.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria after Shelly tells you to have a battle with her (+1 Cal)

## Joining a Gang

Before fighting Shelly, time for a quest. We are required to join a gang to finish the game. Technically we can do this later, but we might as well start now since there are some nice rewards. You get to choose which gang to join: the Magma Gang in the North Obsidia Alleyway, or the Aqua Gang in the Lapis Alleyway. Head over to your choice of alleyway.

Defeat him, and he will tell you an Aqua Gang member has the Pokemon already.

Head over to the Lapis Ward. To the west of the gym you'll find the Aqua Gang member. You'll learn that he already sold the Pokemon to someone in 7th Street, but he'll give you a *Metronome*. That's all we can do for now.

### Getting the Bicycle and Zorua

Regardless of your gang choice, head over to Madame Craudberry's house once more. Inside, she'll try to get you arrested, but if you have saved all the Jasper Ward police officers, they'll trust that you are not a gang member. Hehehe.

Head outside and try to leave, and the cop will even give you a *Bike Voucher*! Enter the building below and trade it away to get the *Bicycle*! Heck yes.

Now that we have our fancy bicycle, we can very quickly get all the way to Beryl Ward from Lapis Ward... so let's do that. Go onto the rooftop of the building where we once captured Helioptile on a clear night, and you'll see... Corey? Make your way to Peridot Ward next, where you'll encounter him near the Pokemart. Finally, head to North Obsidia Ward and enter the building to the left of the alleyway. Inside you'll find him once more... and be able to catch **Zorua**!

## Grand Hall Trainers 3

After defeating Corey, the trainers in the Grand Hall have gotten stronger once again. Defeating them will now yield 5 *Exp. Candy M*! The updated teams are as follows:

There is a front area, a back area, and upstairs - your goal is to turn every single monitor that is in the area on and still successfully get to the upstairs area and cross the bookshelves. You can only cross from the front to the back area if one of the red, blue, and yellow stacks is exactly 1 unit tall.

Using this information, it can be fun to try to solve this puzzle yourself. The game actually has a cheeky secret way to solve it though:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Simply check monitors for a light above or below it. If it is yellow, ignore it, if it is green, click that one next.  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the secret to the Lapis Gym puzzle</a>
</div>

Whichever way you solve the puzzle, click the final monitor that you can find upstairs, then cross the bookshelves. You can find a *Leaf Stone* nearby.

Head up, and save before you fight Shelly.

I think this fight is wonderful because it sweeps the feet out from under new players that think Bug is a terrible type. The Forest Field, as we've seen, powers up Struggle Bug. It also gives Anorith a free Spiky Shield due to its seed. There is yet more synergy with Prankster Illumise's eight turn Rain Dance - it prevents you from burning the forest down, activates Anorith's Swift Swim, weakens your Fire types, and boosts the various Water moves she uses. Plus, it's the first gym that fights in doubles and the combination of Intimidate and Struggle Bug can make your attacks weak - all this combines to making a difficult fight that your team might not immediately be prepared for.

To win, you'll have to come up with a solid doubles strategy. We have some solid TMs like Substitute and Protect that can help with this fight, for one. There are also field manipulation tactics we can use here. The simplest and cheesiest option is to use Castform/Cherrim's Sunny Day or mystery egg Vulpix's Drought to make it sunny, which turns the field to Rainbow Field. You can then exploit the Rainbow Field by using Nature Power which becomes boosted Aurora Beam, and/or 140 flat damage Sonicboom to win. You can also switch up the weather to Hail or Sandstorm - this allows you to use specific Fire type moves to turn the field to the Burning Field, which is basically game over for Shelly if Illumise is knocked out.

Another generally solid strategy is just abusing the field with your own Bug types - Joltik, Vespiquen, and all of the early-evolving stage 3 bugs can shine here. You can use Telluric Seeds if you have them as well to essentially buy your Pokemon a safe turn on switch in to generate some momentum or knock out a particular threat. Alternatively, bring your own Swift Swim team to abuse the rain and outspeed her team. Or, perhaps consider the funny Rock Slide button! Tons of options here if you think ahead about what your strategy will be.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Shelly on your first try (+1 Victoria)
- Defeat Shelly on a second, third, etc. try (-1 Victoria)

After you succeed, you will get the *Cocoon Badge* as well as *TM76 Struggle Bug*, you get to use Lv. 40 Pokemon, and you can now use Rock Smash in the field.

This battle probably won't be too tough if you could defeat Shelly. Nidoking hits hard, but it still has fairly weak STAB attacks. Defeat him with your best strategies.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree to save Heather (+1 Cain)
- Refuse to help Heather (-1 Cain)

With that, Cain and Shelly will head over to the Orphanage.

## Lapis Ward Orphanage

Head into the Orphanage as soon as the door opens. You'll be paired up with either Cain or Shelly depending on who you have more relationship points with at this moment.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat the Orderlies with Cain (+1 Cain)
- Defeat the Orderlies with Shelly (+1 Shelly)

You'll notice that the doctor has a strong team full of Electric and Psychic types. Electivire will often pivot to Musharna, who will use Psychic Terrain, guaranteeing it, Hypno, and Raichu huge bonuses. You can try to use your own Psychic attacks on the terrain against the electric types if you'd like, you can also stall out the Terrain if it is too much to handle. This can be a tough fight but you can find a way through!

Outside, accept Anna's request for fast travel. We'll find ourselves back in the Underground Railnet. Head to the east and smash the rock to progress.

North of here, you'll see a guy selling a single *Link Stone* for $10000. What this does is essentially work as an evolution stone for Pokemon that need to be traded otherwise. To evolve Pokemon that normally trade while holding items, you can give them their item and use the Link Stone on them. This one is pricey, but if you have a Pokemon like Graveler you're trying to evolve, it's worth picking up.

This can be a tough fight since his levels are above your cap and he has Drizzle on his side. That said with no Damp Rock Pelipper is the only rain setter, and only for 5 turns, so you can pretty easily use Protect to make it go away and then go to town. His Sharpedo will outspeed you but doesn't hit incredibly hard, while his Blastoise can be tanky but shouldn't be too threatening outside of the rain.

Once you win, the Aqua Gang will retreat. We can actually now access the pond in the back, nothing new though.

Anyways, return to Maxwell at your alleyway to get **Houndour**. That's it with the Magma Gang for another few badges, however.

### The Aqua Gang Route (Part 2)

If you joined Magma last chapter, [jump to the next section](#rock-smash-exploration)

Return to Archer in Lapis, then head over to the Magma Gang's hideout in North Obsidia. Defeat the guards at the entrance.

This can be a tough fight since his levels are above your cap and he has Drought on his side. As long as Ninetales doesn't switch, there will only be 5 turns of sun, so you can use Protect to make it go away and then go to town. His Houndoom is physical and doesn't hit very hard, while his Charizard is only threatening under the sun.

Once you win, the Magma Gang will retreat. Behind where Maxwell was you can get a hidden *X Attack*.

Anyways, return to Archer at your alleyway to get **Carvanha**. That's it with the Aqua Gang for another few badges, however.

## Rock Smash Exploration

Head over to the Onyx Ward next. Inside one of the rooms upstairs the guy playing "Mr. Mimecraft" will now move. Using the Data Chip we found earlier, we can talk to the PC here for a chance to catch **Porygon**. Next, head to the hallway where the tutors are. Go into the left door - inside you can talk to someone who will tell us a new password: *stopitems*.

In Lapis Ward a lady in the Pokemon Center will tell us about a few more passwords: *leveloffset* and *percentlevel*.

### Smashin' at the Stairway

Head over to the Grand Stairway and make your way to B1F. At the top right, smash a rock, pick up a hidden *Green Shard*, then go up. In this new room you can find a hidden *PP Up*, *Exp. Candy L*, and a stationary *Exp. Candy M*. Talk to the hiker in here for a *Mining Kit*.

The Mining Kit allows us to finally deal with all those glowing rocks everywhere. Essentially we get to play the Gen. IV mining minigame, except the prizes are actually good! Each stone will generate 2-4 items.

Item probabilities are listed [in the appendices](#mining-item-probabilities).

We can't revive the fossils or use the Odd Keystone just yet, but hold onto them if you get them. The evolution stones can help you evolve your team if you manage to find them, and Heart Scales and Shards will be useful throughout the game. The remaining items are generally good hold items, though you can get at least one of each somewhere else in the game as well. There is an incredible number of these glowing rocks throughout the game. I won't be pointing out when there are rocks in a given room, but feel free to break them as you see them.

Back in the main part of B1F, head to the left and smash the rock to go down a ladder. You may find **Solrock** here - this is a randomly determined event. You'll also find a hidden *Red Shard* as well as a *Rare Candy* and an *Amplifield Rock*.

Make your way back to the part with the sequence of ledges on B2F, and take the second path from the left. You'll be able to smash a rock to get an *Exp. Candy M*. Next, head back up and take the rightmost path. Smash some rocks along the path to access a hidden *Exp. Candy M*. Following this path up, you'll find **Lunatone** if you didn't find Solrock earlier.

### Smashin' at the Slums

Next, head to Obsidia Ward. The Sweet Shop has new inventory.

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Sweet Kiss (Bottom) (4 Badges)</strong></th></thead>

</table></div>

Next, we're going to head on over to the Obsidia Slums. On the first floor of the main area of the slums take the top left escalator down to reach B1F. Then go between the escalators through the door here, and use the Dull Key inside. Grab a hidden *Calcium* then enter the next room.

Once you've defeated the third in the middle, you will get **Scraggy**! Afterwards you can pick up a *Brave Mint*, *Exp. Candy L*, and hidden *Exp. Candy XL* and *Full Restore*.

Exit this area and make your way to the top right corner of the main room in the slums. Go down the escalator then enter the room on the right side. Down the stairs you can smash some rocks and head in to a new area of the Railnet.

We don't have Flash yet, so this area can be a bit annoying to search for items and such. In the top right corner you can smash a rock to free a guy. You'll find hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *Rock Gem* nearby. There's also a smash wall above you containing an *Ability Capsule*. Make your way down the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Green Shard*. Go down more stairs and go straight up. Inside a smash wall you can find *TMX8 Flash*... but we don't have the badge to use it yet. Darn.

Anyways, back outside you can find 2 hidden *Purple Shards*, an *Elixir*, and a *Dusk Stone*. Inside another smash wall you can find the *Cave Field Readout*. Before you leave this area though, headbutt the tall iron poles here!

The Power Items downstairs may be more expensive than these consumables, but you can buy them just once and use them infinitely many times. No reason to ever buy here.

### Smashin' at Beryl Cave

Well, we're back in the Rhodochrine Jungle, in a new area this time. You can find hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Bug Gem*, and *Big Mushroom* here, as well as *TM05 Roar*.

On windy days, you can have a battle!

Just gotta find a way to hit Shiftry with a Bug move and you'll probably win here. As a reward, you'll get **Nuzleaf** by talking to it.

The totem at the top here also has Pokemon in it. For each Ill-Fated Doll you have (we only have 1) you can fight and catch a Pokemon in the sequence **Baltoy**, **Elgyem**, **Golett**. Which Pokemon this sequence starts at is randomly determined, however. If you make your way all the way back through Beryl Cave to Beryl Ward, then return without an Ill-Fated Doll in your bag on a clear day, you can catch **Natu** on the totem pole.

### Smashin' at Citrine Mountain

Next, we're going to cross Beryl Bridge and smash the rock here, then enter.

1. Start by going to the right. You'll find a hidden *Ability Capsule* and in the wall you can get **Amaura** as long as you have an Ice Heal. Head back to the entrance.
2. Go down from the top of the area, grab the hidden *Super Potion* to the right. Head back up.
3. Talk to **Croagunk** down from here, who will join us thanks to the Silver Ring. Get a hidden *Burn Heal* and Backtrack six platforms.
4. Go left. Along this path you'll find *Blue Shard*, *Shoal Salt*, *Protein*, and *Hyper Potion*. It will fork again eventually: go down the left fork. You can find a hidden *Hyper Potion*, *Purple Shard*, and *Shoal Salt*. Also, pick up the *Short-Circuit Field Readout* here. Will be useful soon!
5. Back up at the fork, go right. You'll find another 2 hidden *Shoal Salts*, *Blue Shard*, and *Max Repel*. Enter the cave entrance up from here, and pick up the hidden *Red Shard* as well as the *Exp. Candy M* and *NeverMeltIce* inside. Talk to Smoochum when you're ready.

This looks like quite the intimidating battle due to the level difference, but it has its default moves. Blizzard will tear you up but it only has 5 PP, so if you can stall those out with the Protect TM and get a Ghost type onto the field to whittle it down with status moves, you're basically set. After winning, you'll get **Smoochum**.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Save Smoochum (+2 Blake)

Exit the cave via Escape Rope or backtracking to the top of the previous room.

Finally time to take on the Ghost type leader. If you check your field notes for Short-Circuit, you'll notice some of the things that make Shade difficult to fight. Most of his Ghost type moves get a boost on this field as do the Electric type moves on half of his team. He also has near full IV's on his entire team, a rarity for us so far. Gengar is a solid lead that likes to hit really hard or put you to sleep, so you might need to plan ahead with some priority or anti-sleep measures. Doublade and Banette give themselves a bit of bulk with their seeds while Mimikyu's Disguise ability infamously gives it a free turn to get to +2 Attack or revenge kill for free.

That said, there are a lot of fairly reliable ways to beat the Entity. One lies in the typing: if you can't beat him, join him. Your own Ghost type moves will also be boosted by the field, so something like Unburden Drifblim or a fast Banette can work out well here. Past Mimikyu there also isn't really anything that effectively can stop a fast Dark type such as Chlorophyll Shiftry, so you can try to overwhelm him with super-effective damage that way as well. The field will also switch to Factory Field when certain moves like Discharge are used, so if you have a strategy involving Gear Grind or an Electric type core you could probably make that work, though note Rotom likes to change the field back with its own Discharge.

After you win, you'll get the *Omen Badge* as well as *TM65 Shadow Claw*. Our new cap is Lv. 45 and we can use Flash now.

# Episode 6: Poison In Vein

Head out from the Abandoned Power Plant and return to Jasper Ward and attempt to enter Peridot. You'll meet up with Cain here, so follow him into the Police Station and watch the scene.

Before we continue with the story, head over to the Opal Ward. Once more, there are new trainers on the bridge.

Seems like our partner is actually the 16th gym leader. Defeat the grunts with her, grab a hidden *Antidote*, then go down the stairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Amaria you trust her (+1 Amaria)
- Tell Amaria you don't trust her (-1 Amaria)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Ace you think they might be a double double agent (+1 Ace)
- Tell Ace you don't think they could be a double double agent (-1 Ace)

With that, we'll be plunked into a cage with a bunch of Pokemon. Essentially we need to combine Loudred's powers of deafening, Jigglypuff's powers of putting the guard to sleep, and Abra's powers of teleportation to move Pokemon around and attack the cages. In the top left if we saved the day-care couple and talked to the Meteor in Coral Ward, you'll see a Ditto, and we can get some goodies with it. To get all the goodies and escape from the cage, talk to the Pokemon in this order:

1. Get a *Rare Candy*: Loudred, Abra, Vanillite/Ditto, Abra, Lickitung, Lickitung/Ditto.
2. Obtain **Ditto**: Abra, Lickitung/Ditto, Abra, Makuhita, Makuhita/Ditto.
3. Heat up the bars via Flamethrower: Abra, Vanillite, Abra, Cyndaquil, Loudred, Jigglypuff, Cyndaquil
4. Freeze the bars via Ice Beam: Loudred, Abra, Cyndaquil, Abra, Vanillite, Loudred, Jigglypuff, Vanillite
5. Break the bars via Rock Blast: Loudred, Abra, Vanillite, Abra, Roggenrola, Loudred, Jigglypuff, Roggenrola
6. Bonus: wake up the guard for a battle: Loudred

Now you can escape and talk to the guard for a fight.

One more bonus: use Abra to teleport the guard into a cage. Nice.

Pick up a hidden *Dire Hit* on this floor, then go down the stairs to the left. In this room you can find a *Magnet Powder*, *Exp. Candy L*, *TM49 Echoed Voice* and the *PULSE Readout 4*.

This time ZEL comes at us with both a PULSE and three Eeveelutions. The first three members of the team aren't particularly tough - something with a bit of physical bulk and a healing option can take Umbreon, while a fast physical attacker or two can deal with Glaceon and Espeon.

The PULSE Muk can be difficult to deal with. It has a bit more speed than Tangrowth, but still not enough that you won't be able to outspeed it with most Pokemon. It's Protean ability gives it STAB on field boosted Discharge and Muddy Water and makes it a bit hard to plan your offense since it changes types. While its 97 Sp. Atk isn't monumental, with 105 HP, 250 Special Defense, and Leftovers, you won't really be able to do anything to it with special moves. Knock Off is a good idea here to prevent it's recovery, or you can opt to hit really hard with two or three physical attackers that are able to capitalize on Protean with moves super effective against Poison / Ground / Water / Electric depending on what it's used last.

Once you win, you'll get the *Harbor Key*.

## Apophyll Beach

Make your way towards the Coral Ward and enter the locked warehouse in the top left. Inside, you can take the boat to Apophyll Beach!

As soon as you enter, go straight left and weave between the hills to get a *Wave Incense*.

Pick up a hidden *Guard Spec*. Now we are going to enter the six doors in this area: the top left has a *Black Belt*, the girl in the bottom left wants us to steal a TV for her (in a bit), the Dudebro in the top right wants Protein in exchange for his *Ashen Beach Field Readout*, the guy in the middle right will give us *Pure Incense*, the bottom right room contains a person who will tell us about the *unrealtime* password and a person who judges Hidden Power types.

Enter the area at the top, then go up the stairs. Talk to every NPC here and agree to study with those who ask. One is a tutor.

The type berries are all pretty useful when you need them, but I would recommend only stocking up when you know you need some because of the price.

Anyways, back in Apophyll, we are next going to explore the optional area Apophyll Cave at the very top-left corner of the beach.

## Pyrous Mountain

Now we can continue with the story. Head into the meditation area to the south of the academy and talk to the pink haired lady.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Kiki you are a new student (+1 Cal, +1 Victoria)

Head into the back room of the academy and talk to Kiki again. She will tell us that we have to battle Victoria or we have to battle Cal. We actually can do both of them, so I will cover both fights. If you feel like skipping one of them, you can.

To fight Victoria, head into the courtyard of the academy.

Victoria has a tougher team than last time. She picked up a Mienfoo and finally evolved her other four team members, so they can actually deal significant damage now. You'll notice from the field notes that Strength and Meditate are boosted on this field, so watch out for those. With good coverage and/or exploiting the field you can win this battle!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Victoria at Apophyll Academy (+1 Victoria)

Cal is on the top of Pyrous Mountain. We aren't required to go up here yet as you only need to fight one of them, but we will need to climb it eventually, so I do it now. Make your way to the mountain via the bottom left corner of Apophyll Beach.

You can also find Magcargo by smashing the nearby pillars. Anyways, nothing to do on 1F so go to B1F via the ladder. You'll see a pillar glowing, which means we can drain lava by rock smashing it. Do so, then go down the ladder to the left to B2F.

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and drain the lava. Head up the ladder and immediately come back down. If it is still glowing, you can smash the pillar to get **Turtonator**. This is one of two possibilities of a randomly determined event.

Back on B1F, you'll see that the lava has drained, so go into the empty pool and go down. Head down the ladder here, and you'll find a hidden *Charcoal* and a *Fire Stone*. If you didn't get Turtonator earlier, there will be a **Heatmor** here to catch. Back upstairs, jump down the hole in the floor to get a *Flame Orb* as well as the *Super-Heated Field Readout*.

Head back to 1F, where the lava will now be drained as well. Follow the path up to 3F. A lava pool will force you to the left back to 2F, where you can drain the lava. Take the ladder to 1F then head to the left to drain it again. Finally, return to B1F then B2F to finish draining the lava as we did before.

Make your way back to 3F, then go across the empty pool. On 4F you can find a hidden *X Defend* before exiting to the peak. The peak hides a *Exp. Candy L*.

Cal now has a full team of six and gets the full benefit of the field. It boosts Scald as well as the Fire moves, and can turn into the Burning Field if Magmortar gets to use Lava Plume. Aside from Scald your own Water types will have a tougher time on this field. Luckily, he still makes some suboptimal moves - his Typhlosion hits hardest with Solar Beam and his Charizard is physical, for example. Past Hakamo-o a Rock type or two can pretty much destroy his whole team.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Cal atop Pyrous Mountain (+2 Cal)

Return to Kiki's room once you're done with your chosen battle(s) and talk to them inside.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Victoria you cannot keep a secret (-1 Victoria)

## VS. The Sensei

To finish off this section, we have to battle Kiki in the main courtyard. Prepare your team because this is a toughie. Make sure to save before, just in case.

Man this fight kicks my butt on at least half of my replays. Ashen Beach field has so many little things that help her team of six fully evolved Fighting types, so you really have to be on your toes to survive this battle. Her lead either will go straight for a field boosted Strength or will set up +3 Attack on the first turn, so it is hard to immediately get momentum. In the back is Toxicroak who loves setting up and punishing you with Sucker Punch, Hitmonlee, who will outspeed everything thanks to the combo of Normal Gem, Fake Out, and Unburden, Gallade who... is just OK but still strong, Lucario who is the sole special attacker and loves to get a double boost with field-boosted Calm Mind, and Medicham, who hits like a truck and always crits thanks to its seed. Medicham and Lucario also ignore accuracy and evasion with their abilities!

This field can't be changed naturally, but you there are powerful tricks you can use to exploit it. Psychic, Zen Headbutt, and Calm Mind get boosts here, so if you can get around Hitmonlee and Toxicroak's priority/speedy dark moves, a Psychic type can do heavy damage. The Sand and Mud moves also get boosted here as do Muddy Water and Surf, so if you need extra damage, they're great options especially under Rain. Otherwise, it's really all just about countering the priority moves and building momentum. If you're able to bait out Toxicroak's 5 Sucker Punches, you can use those turns to set up a sweeper of your own. Exploit Nature Power too: since it turns into Meditate, it can turn many physical attackers into potential sweepers. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Kiki on your first try (+1 Victoria)
- Defeat Kiki on the second, third, etc. try (-2 Victoria)

With that, we can start to explore this island. Note that many item balls are Foongus in disguise.

The first island has a *Potion* and hidden *Pretty Wing*. The next area contains a *Great Ball* and hidden *Hyper Potion*. Before cutting the tree go to the left across the moss to get a hidden *Red Shard* and *TM83 Infestation*.

Cut the tree and go right. Before going down the ledge you can get an *Antidote* as well as hidden *Ice Gem*, *Resist Wing* and 2 *TinyMushrooms*. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* below.

On the next island to the right, you can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Red Shard*, and *Synthetic Seed*. Following the path behind the Foongus in the bottom left you can get a *Shiny Stone*.

Back up from here, cross to the right. You can find a hidden *Green Shard* on this island. At the top left there is a path across the water that will lead to a hidden *Thunderstone*.

Head down the ledge on the east island. You can find a hidden *Swift Wing* here and follow the ivy up from here to get the *Swamp Field Readout*. Briefly stopping on the middle island, head down using the ivy to pick up a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* then head left.

You can head down as soon as you touch land to get a *Miracle Seed*. Back on land, you'll find a hidden *Great Ball* and *Guard Spec.* Use the Light Shard and head left. Before continuing left to the next island, you can go down via the ivy to find one hidden *Dusk Ball* and one non-hidden *Dusk Ball*. Head up and left when you're ready.

Another battle with Aster and Eclipse, this time featuring a full team. Solrock and Lunatone are somewhat slow and have many weaknesses. The Lycanrocs and Passimian are speedy and hit hard, but after a few turns they'll all become slowed down by the field, allowing you to capitalize on their low bulk. Oranguru likes to use Instruct and/or hit both of your Pokemon with Nature Power into field-boosted Muddy Water, so be careful of that.

Left from here you'll grab a hidden *Potion*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Ether*, and *Escape Rope*. Cut the tree up from here to get another hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Go down from here. You'll find a *Magical Seed* and hidden *Purple Shard*. Head down and right to grab a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* and a hidden *Green Shard* a bit further... and we can finally enter the building here.

Pick up the *PULSE Readout 6* and talk to the machine in the top to reveal a secret passageway. Heal or switch up your team and go up.

Time to fight Taka again. Although he has added Klefki and Gligar to his team, neither should be too threatening. Just be careful of Exeggutor hitting hard with its STABs and Nature Power -> Gear Grind, and also Chatot setting up on you.

Accept Cain's fast travel request.

## The Battle for Apophyll

Once you're back on Apophyll, prepare your team. It's worth pointing out that winning the upcoming boss battle  is optional, but there are strategies to win if you're interested. Head down to Pyrous Mountain.

Head in and you'll be partnered up with Victoria.

Once you reach the peak, Victoria will separate from us as a partner. It's time for that boss battle I was talking about.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to win this battle.**

This is an "impossible battle" in the normal sense that the story will progress if you lose, but it actually does acknowledge your success with being a precondition for one of the postgame routes as well as some points. For that reason I will hide the text on my recommendations.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    You won't have an easy time with status conditions thanks to the Full Heals. There are still numerous things you can do here. The Focus Sash is always an option - putting it on a Counter Pokemon or something with attack-lowering moves can open it up to not kill some of your Pokemon. For an easier time, Bastiodon and Sudowoodo both get Sturdy and Metal Burst / Counter, Sharpedo can Speed Boost and use Destiny Bond, Murkrow can use Prankster Perish Song... the possibilities for this fight are vast.  </div>

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Cain, +1 Victoria, +1 Cal, +1 Shade, +1 Anna, +3 Taka)

Return to Reborn City after the scenes here conclude.

## Grand Hall Trainers 4

Once more, trainers in the Grand Hall have gotten stronger. Defeating them will now yield 5 *Exp. Candy L*, so grinding weaker team members is much easier. The updated teams are as follows:

In this first area you can find 2 hidden *Blue Shards*, *Green Shard*, *Potion*, *Telluric Seed*, and *Poison Gem*. Follow the ledge at the bottom and pick up a hidden *Full Heal* and *Red Shard*. A nearby slide will take you to a hidden *Green Shard* and *Escape Rope*. Read the grave while you're here to initiate a quest.

Enter the building and emerge at the top. On this upper platform you can find a hidden *Green Shard*. The slide to the left leads us back to the first area, so don't take that. Instead, go up from the statue and hop down the ledge, in the top left corner. You'll find hidden *Genius Wing*, *Ability Capsule*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, and *Carbos*. In the top right side there is a canister you can talk to that will turn red - we will need to do this to multiple canisters across the wasteland to access a secret area. In the top left corner of this area you can enter a cave. Following it to the left and out you can get a hidden *Cotton Candy*. Back through the cave, go down and left, then down the ledge. Make your way back down the ledge and slide to reach the building with the stairs and emerge at the top.

Take the slide to the right now. You can find hidden *X Defend*, *X Speed*, *Hyper Potion*, *Exp. Candy L*, *Poke Ball*, *Purple Shard*, *Green Shard*, *Poison Barb*, *Purple Shard*, and *Protein*. Up from here you can find another canister to turn red. Up and to the left you can go through a building to find a hidden *Black Sludge*. Head to the bottom left of this segment. Hop down one ledge. Here you'll find another canister to turn red, the *Wasteland Field Readout* hiding behind a rock as well as hidden *Blue Shard* and *Peppermint*. From here you'll have to go back through the building and down the right slide to return to this area.

In the bottom right section, use the Light Shard and talk to Ace for a battle.

Ace has a full team but it isn't particularly bolstered by the field. Be careful not to let Honchkrow or Clefable sweep you and you can find a way through this fight!

Talk to the screen beyond them to unlock a door down and to the right. Exit the building at the top and go down the first slide. You'll find a *Lax Incense* up here. Go down the slide to the left. You'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Heart Scale*, and *Calcium*, as well as another canister to turn red. Down the ledge, you'll need to go through the building again. Take the slide on the right now, and grab the hidden *Potion*.

In the top right corner of the area, you can find hidden *Ground Gem*, *Purple Shard*, *Ether*, and *Ice Heal*. Talk to the final canister to turn red.

Talk to Cain if you'd like then enter the building. Heal and prepare your team, save, then enter the room on the left.

Fern is back with a full team. His general strategies remain the same: Krookodile will try to sweep, Roserade will hit hard and fast with Giga Drain to heal itself, and Decidueye will try to Sucker Punch you and/or sweep with Swords Dance. Scyther hits fairly hard with its STABs, especially Technician Wing Attack. Fraxure and Rhydon aren't as bad but you still have to be careful.

Past the Ground types, a Poison type can abuse the field to sweep the fight. Nature Power turns into Gunk Shot and, as an added bonus, is immune to Sucker Punch. Once you can get past Roserade he doesn't have an incredible amount of speed so a boosted sweeper can probably succeed here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Fern on the first try (+1 Aya, +1 Hardy)

Before doing the gym battle, there is some side content. Turn all the canisters in the wasteland red if you want to explore the Byxbysion Tunnels.

## Byxbysion Tunnels

Head down from the wasteland hideout, smash the rock and go down the ledge. You'll see that the left building door is now open.

Enter the next cave entrance.

Interact with both canisters to move the bookshelf at the top, revealing a secret room. Inside it, you can find a hidden *Sun Stone*.

Mr. Bigglesworth is tough and also our first opponent that is EV trained. You can set up while the Trubbish are out with your own Steel or Poison type then destroy him. Sad :(

Behind you'll find *TM09 Venoshock* as well as the *PULSE Readout 0*.

That's it for this area, so return to the room with the two canisters. Hidden behind the left one is another tunnel. As you follow the path you can get a hidden *Focus Sash*. Nice.

Once you appear outside, go down the slide here and grab a hidden *Moon Stone*. Go in the cave and head up the ladder, then go right back down this ladder to reach a new area...? This doesn't really make sense, but neither does much of the wasteland, really. The mining rock here is all we can get right now, so head up the ladder, go down the slide, and then make your way all the way back to the Wasteland hideout.

Aya is another difficult doubles gym leader. For one, the field boosts her all-target Sludge Waves as well as Venusaur's Power Whip. Entry Hazards are all turned into end-of-turn effects: Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rocks will do damage and the former will Poison your Pokemon. With the speedy Nidoqueen and Salazzle, the bulky Toxapex and Dragalge, and Venusaur and Drapion for coverage, her team is well suited to deal with many of the strategies you might think to use. Plus, while you'd immediately think Earthquake is a good answer, the move's damage is quartered on this field, so that's not really an option.

The key to this battle in my experience is letting Toxapex hang out on the left side, especially if you can lower its Special Attack or put it to sleep.  Toxapex does have Merciless which is always on, but still doesn't hit incredibly hard and will probably be going last unless it has gotten off a lot of Icy Wind. With two moves per turn focusing on the Pokemon to its right, you may be able to preserve momentum long enough to come out on top. For that reason, putting Psychic type attackers, and/or Steel/Poison type defenders on the field and letting them tank attacks and knock out the threats will probably pay out. Ice is also a pretty good offensive type here, note that Freeze Dry can take four of her Pokemon super-effectively and the other two neutrally. You can also use your own entry hazard spam, standard doubles strategies like Wide Guard and Protect, or the Telluric seed to boost a sweeper.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Aya on the first try (+1 Hardy, +1 Fern)

Once you win you'll get the *Blight Badge*, *TM34 Sludge Wave*, and get a Level 50 cap finally. We also get to use Strength in the field, finally!

# Episode 8: Of Fathers Forgotten

Make your way all the way back out of the Wasteland. You'll find Cain near the exit. Prepare for a fight.

Another fight with Cain, this time on a field that benefits his team to some extent. Most of his Pokemon aren't very fast, so a fast sweeper or two can probably clean house. Just watch out for Muk who hits like a truck and also has Minimize for extra shenanigans.

Return to South Obsidia Ward.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you believe Cal (+1 Cal)
- Say you don't believe Cal (-1 Cal)

Cal will give you *TMX4 Strength*!

## Strength Exploration

Having Strength means there is a lot of exploration that we can now do. First of all, put Chingling into your party with the Soothe Bell attached. We'll need it evolved for a quest soon, so might as well take advantage of all the walking we are about to do.

First, note that the candy store has new inventory now.

Next, make your way all the way up to Citrine Mountain 2F via Beryl Bridge.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citrine2f2.png"/>

Go down and right (1). You'll see a strength boulder. Push it from the top so it goes down. Then, make your way around to the left (2) and step across the ice path that is now open. You will find a hidden *Shoal Salt* and *Red Shard* as well as *TM94 Secret Power*. Exit the mountain.

Make your way west to the Beryl Cemetery. Victoria is down from here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria in the cemetery (+2 Victoria)

Next, we're gonna return to Byxbysion Wasteland. Make your way to the right, going down the slide as before. After exiting the tall building, head up over the ledge and enter the cave at the top. Push the boulder into the hole and follow it, then go into the now accessible cave. Prepare for a fight and talk to the grave.

Another tough fight with a single Pokemon, but you have some cheese strategies in your back pocket if need be.

Win and you'll obtain **Misdreavus**.

Back outside in the wasteland, make your way to the tunnels area and enter the room with two canisters. Head through the secret path to the left. When you get outside, go down the slide and enter the next room. Take the ladder up then immediately back down. Now we can move this boulder aside! Jump down the hidden ledge and move the next boulder to the left, then go up.

Here, you can find an *Exp. Candy L*, *TM12 Taunt*, and hidden *Ability Capsule* and *Nugget*. On rainy days you can also find a **Squirtle** chilling in the fountain, which we can catch. This is the first of the starters we can obtain aside from the starter table at the beginning of the game.

Return to the wasteland proper, and enter the tall building with stairs on the left side of the map. Show the Squirtle we caught to the guy inside for a *Data Chip*.

Next, take the boat to Apophyll. Head inside Pyrous Mountain and make your way up to 3F. Carefully maneuver the boulder into the hole here and follow it down. You'll find Tepig here, but talk to it and it will flee. Next, make your way to B1F and go to the right. Move the boulder and talk to Tepig again. Grab *TM37 Sandstorm* while you're here. Finally, make your way to the peak. Talk to **Tepig** and you'll be able to catch it!

Exit and take the boat to Azurine Island. At night, if your Chingling has enough friendship, it will evolve into **Chimecho**. Take Chimecho into the building where we battled Taka and show it to a guy here to obtain **Chikorita**.

## Yureyu Building

With that out of the way, head into the Underground Railnet and use Strength to reach the top. Grab the now-accessible hidden *Red Shard* and enter the door with the Y. This room has a hidden *Great Ball* and *Dragon Gem*. Upstairs is a hidden *Exp. Candy M* and outside you can find a hidden *Link Stone* and *Exp. Candy L*. Head into the Yureyu building.

You'll be partnered with Cain.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk with Cain while you're in Yureyu (+1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Try to leave Yureyu while partnered with Cain (-1 Cain)

Thanks to the assistance of Cain, this one shouldn't be too bad. Musharna will use Psychic Terrain like last time, and his Electric and Psychic core will try to wear you down. The Short-Circuit Field will boost the former and the Psychic Terrain the latter, so make sure you neutralize the most threatening of your two opponents is each turn and you'll probably win.

Thanks to the assistance of Cain, this one shouldn't be too tough. You'll have to be careful of Minior setting up. Otherwise his Pokemon are generally fast and strong but frail, so if you have good type advantages and basic doubles strategies you can certainly do it.

## Underground Railnet East

Back on the ground floor, head east to enter another part of the railnet.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/railnet_east.png"/>

This room is pretty huge - scattered around you can find a hidden *Awakening*, *Revive*, *Super Potion*, *Resist Wing*, *Red-Hots*, *Swift Wing*, *Purple Shard*, *Protein*, *Cheri Berry*, 3 *Blue Shards*, 2 *PokeSnaxs*, and *Super Repel*. These items are roughly nearby the yellow marks on the map.

You can also find a bunch more of those shallow walls that you can use Rock Smash on - indicated by green arrows above. Behind these are *House Key*, *Iron Ball*, *Corrupted Poke Ball*, and *TM44 Rest*. You can also open the gate to the left (circled in blue) to create a shortcut to the Aron room.

Talk to Shelly on the right side of the area, then enter the train at the bottom of the map. Back outside, you'll need to use levers to connect this train to the exit area on the right. Essentially you can just follow the tracks until you hit a roadblock, then backtrack and click the lever and follow the new path until you are all done.

If you get stuck, set up the tracks such that the train would follow the orange arrow in the above image.

Talk to Noel when you have the correct layout. Re-enter the train. Talk to Shelly if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Shelly she was helpful (+1 Shelly)
- Tell Shelly she was not helpful (-1 Shelly)

Talk to Charlotte. CHOO CHOO!

## Tanzan Cove

We will emerge in a new area. Here, you'll find a *Purple Shard*, *Full Heal*, *Normal Gem*, and *Elemental Seed*. If it's raining, a guy on this map will tell us about the password *stablweather*. You can actually choose whether to go to the Belrose Manse via Tanzan Mountain first, or to go to Spinel Town via the forest first. Here, we will go to Belrose first, but you can skip this section and come back to it after Spinel if you'd like.

On the left as you walk in, you'll see whichever of **Solrock** and **Lunatone** that you didn't get to catch earlier.

On this map, you'll find hidden *X Speed*, *PokeSnax*, *Hyper Potion*, 2 *Blue Shards*, *Revive*, *Ground Gem*, *Steel Gem*, *Escape Rope*, *Ultra Ball*, *Purple Shard*, and a visible *Exp. Candy XL*.

Talk to Charlotte then emerge at the top into Tanzan Cove.

More importantly, you'll find a *Mystic Water* and hidden *Link Stone* inside.

Back outside, head to the left and down, and attempt to exit the forest. A nearby tree will disappear, so follow the newly created path downwards. By now you've noticed that stuff is teleporting in and out. While this is confusing, the good news is that the path is mostly linear from here.

Go up, right, and down. You'll notice a single tree blocking off an open path below; approaching the tree will make it disappear. Follow this new path to find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Exp. Candy L*, and *Heart Scale*. To the right, you can talk to someone for the *Grassy Terrain Field Readout* and pick up a *Mild Mint* and a *Hasty Mint*. Enter the train to the left, and pick up the egg. It'll be **Cacnea** or **Maractus**, randomly determined.

Head back up and go left, continuing our linear travel through the teleporting tree forest. You'll go up towards the entrance, then go right.

Inside the railcave, there are two secret paths to goodies. First, you'll notice that each room has train tracks that point to three out of the four directions: start by entering the entrance that is not being pointed to by the tracks. Repeat this process over and over until you reach a room containing an *Ill-Fated Doll* and **Eevee**! You can read the Captain's Log here as well.

Back in the main area of the railcave, you'll notice that each room contains three rocks. In each room two of these rocks are close to one of the four directions - enter this direction. Repeat this process over and over until you reach a room containing a hidden *Ability Capsule*, the *Psychic Terrain Field Readout*, and *TM32 Double Team*.

Back in the forest, continue your circles by going left instead of up. Once you reach the upper right side of the area you'll see a path leading to the right.

You'll find a hidden *Elemental Seed* as well as the *Burning Field Readout*, a *Quiet Mint* and an *Exp. Candy L*. This is also the Mossy Rock where you can get Leafeon.

Continue your circles by going up and left. You'll finally be able to enter Spinel Town at the clearing in the top right side!

## Spinel Town

You'll notice that everything is chaos here, teleporting like crazy. Enter an apartment building on the left side and a girl's furniture will all disappear. She'll ask us to get it back, so head out of her house.

Down from here, there's a tree in front of a house. The tree will move when you approach it. Inside, you can return the Kadabra girl's bed, and pick up the *Good Rod*! Outside, the fountain will disappear as you approach. Heading towards the center of town, you'll see the Kadabra girl's TV on top of a building. Trying to enter the Pokemart will cause it to teleport as well. To the right, you'll see Kadabra girl's bookshelf.

Enter the left tall apartment building. Inside, you'll find Kadabra girl's table. In the building to the right, a person inside will offer to trade your Shelmet and Karrablast for their respective evolutions. You will also be asked to pet every Eeveelution: new long sidequest!

Talk to a lady sitting on the bench, and she will completely disappear. Ok then. Go down and to the right: a house here will also disappear. Beyond it you will find Kadabra girl's first chair. Her second chair is up and to the right of the Pokemon Center. Speaking of, a guy inside the center will tell us a password: *hardcap*.

Enter the museum. Unfortunately every time we enter here it will cost $500. You can explore the museum to learn a bunch of lore. Upstairs is a person who will revive our fossils! So, that means depending on what you've found mining it is now possible to get **Omanyte**, **Kabuto**, **Lileep**, **Anorith**, **Cranidos**, and **Shieldon**. Unfortunately to finish the revival you have to leave the museum and pay the fee again! I will note that if you only have a single Helix Fossil, there is a quest later on that requires us to have one, so consider saving it for now if you aren't dying to have an Omanyte right now.

Anyways, head down and out of the door upstairs here and into the door on the other side to pick up the *Eevium-Z*. We can't use Mega Stones or Z-Crystals yet. Kadabra girl's nightstand is also in here, as well as a standard Ice Cream vending machine that contains a **Vanillite** like in the Sweet Co.

In the downstairs area of the museum at night, you'll see two Meteor grunts. Talk to them and they will flee to Tanzan Mountain. We will get to them in a bit. Oh, and there's a *Luxury Ball* in the trash to the right.

Outside, attempt to enter the Voclain Estate in the top right corner. Before you talk to Serra, talk to Bennett if you want points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett you knew Cascoon had perfect memories (+1 Bennett)

I hope they remember me killing 15 of them with Fire type moves in Pokemon Legends Arceus.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Bennett a second time (+1 Bennett)

In the upstairs rooms, you can find *Silk Scarf*, the *Mirror Arena Field Readout*, *TM85 Dream Eater*, *Bug Memory*, and *Weakness Policy*. You'll also find Kadabra girl's last bookshelf in Bennett's room.

With that, we should now have all of the furniture back, so return to the girl to get the *Exp. All*. An excellent item that levels your whole team and prevents leveling over the cap.

## Good Rod Encounters and Other Things

We could now go for the next badge, though there are many new Pokemon and items we can now get after visiting Spinel Town.

Grab your Male Burmy from the PC and level it to 20 so it evolves into **Mothim**.

Return to Chrysolia Forest - you'll have to basically do the circles in reverse to exit the forest. On your way you'll find the house that teleported earlier. A guy inside will do an in-game trade: your Mothim for his **Bruxish**.

Down from here, you'll find the teleported fountain. **Remoraid** will jump out for you to battle.

Return to Tanzan Mountain. Inside, you'll find the grunts from earlier.

Defeat them here - we will return to the museum later to claim our reward. 

Now that we have a new rod there are a lot of encounters we can now get.

Make sure you catch a Luvdisc for an in-game trade we'll get to in a bit.

The other major thing we can do now in Reborn City is to head on over to Onyx Ward and return the House Key to the girl on the west side to get a *Heart Scale*. She is the Move Relearner and will trade us relearned moves for Heart Scales... which we have in spades thanks to mining. Juice up your movesets if you'd like.

Take the Coral Ward boat to Apophyll. Grab Luvdisc from the PC, then head along the outer right wall of the academy to find someone who'll do an in-game trade: your Luvdisc for their **Darumaka**.

Finally, head all the way back through the railnet and the forest to Spinel Town. Talk to the museum curator to get your choice of *Plume Fossil* or *Armor Fossil*, which you can revive for **Archen** or **Tirtouga** respectively.

## Rime Badge

Return to Voclain Estate. Enter the room towards the back to reach the gym. In each room, you'll have to look for something that's wrong on one of the two sides. It could be a misplaced or miscolored item or something thematically tied to the gym. Anyways, once you find this discrepancy, smash the wall immediately above. If you're wrong, your party will take some damage, but you can always heal.

For each of the three puzzle rooms (so, a max of +3), you can get the following:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Smash the correct mirror on the first try (+1 Serra)
- Smash 2-5 incorrect mirrors before finding the answer (-1 Serra)
- Smash 6-7 incorrect mirrors before finding the answer (-2 Serra)

It's time for our first battle with Bennett. Despite mainly using the crappy early game bugs, he has a highly optimized team for the Mirror Arena. All of the accuracy and evasion items and abilities raise his team's chance to get critical hits. With field boosted moves like Signal Beam, his Pokemon hit hard and fast. Five of six have Quiver Dance, so they'll probably try to set up on you. That said, his Bugs are all pretty frail and have lots of weaknesses - simply loading up on Rock moves will probably solve most of the problem. It's a good opportunity to try out your own Mirror Arena boosts - read the field notes.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Bennett on the first try (+1 Elias, -1 Bennett)
- Beat Bennett on the second, etc. try (+1 Bennett, -1 Elias)

Break the last mirror and head into the gym arena when you're ready.

Serra is a tough gym leader that operates on the back of her very unique field effect. Instead of thinking about how to beat a Hail-team like you normally would, you have to play around the fields various Accuracy and Evasion shenanigans. Her Bright Powder, Wide Lens, and Synthetic Seeds as well as Snow Cloak abilities all raise accuracy or evasion and boost critical-hit rate. For that reason you won't really be able to pull off a Special Defense boosting strategy nor use screens. In general, physical attackers will have a much harder time here since when they miss, they take damage. Special attackers, of which Serra has five, have a chance to hit anyways even when they miss - some of their attacks are even boosted in this case. Her Jynx, Froslass, and Sandslash under Hail are all incredibly fast as well. On the flip side, Glaceon, Alola-tales, and Lapras are a bit tankier. The latter two like to set up 8-turn Aurora Veil to further support their defensive strategy. All in all this is a tough fight that doubles down on the weaknesses of the Ice type and uses the Mirror Arena to great effect.

As you would assume just looking at the team, non-hail weather, and Brick Break / Psychic Fangs are generally good things to bring. Luckily, as stacked the Mirror Arena is for Serra, you can pretty easily use it to your benefit as well. There is a list of abilities that you can use to get Accuracy or Evasion, and we also have access to the Lax Incense and Zoom Lens at this point. All of these will allow you to get a boosted critical hit ratio - with priority, that means you can pick up some easy one shots on the glass cannons. The accuracy ones in particular will allow your physical attackers to overcome the misses + recoil damage and capitalize on the low Defense on Serra's Pokemon. Mirror Coat is a good option that you can use situationally to boost your defensive stats and knock out a threat like Lapras.

All of these things are nice, but it turns out there's something *even better* that you can use. Nature Power turns into Mirror Shot, which is boosted by two times and will always lower accuracy. That means any Special Attacker with access to Nature Power can use a 130 BP Steel type move that will never miss... against a team full of Ice types - only Lapras and Sandslash take neutral damage from it. On top of Chlorophyll, this allows even a team of all Grass types to effortlessly sweep the team of Ice types!

It's worth noting that there are a list of moves in the Field Notes that can destroy the Mirror Arena entirely. This can be another viable strategy to force Serra onto a more even playing field. However:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Break the Mirror Field in the gym fight (-1 Serra)

Once you win, you'll get the *Rime Badge* which boosts our cap to Lv. 55. You'll also get *TM70 Aurora Veil*.

# Episode 9: Sister's Keeper

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Serra on the couch after the battle (+1 Serra)

Exit the gym.

## Two Herbal Extracts

Make your way out of Spinel Town, through the woods, and head back towards Tanzan Mountain. You'll finally be able to enter the Pokemart here! One person sells the now-updated default items, but there is another vendor.

The Powders aren't really worth it unless you're going for a Frustration build, but we will need two Herbal Extracts: one for a sidequest and one to continue the story.

If you chose to go to Spinel Town before Belrose Manse, you can [read the above section on Tanzan Cove](#tanzan-cove) for encounters, items, etc.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeated Serra and got Herbal Medicine before entering the Belrose Manse (+1 Charlotte)

Anyways, head to Belrose Manse and go upstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Noel without Herbal Extract in your inventory (-1 Noel)

Give the medicine to Anna and she will feel better. Head outside.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly while Noel wants to battle you (+1 Shelly)

We can talk to Noel to advance the plot, but we can actually use the second Herbal Extract we got right now to get a nice reward, so I'll take care of that now.

Head over to the Chrysolia Forest and go up. You'll find the lady that was teleported off the bench here. Give her the Herbal Extract to get *Department Store Sticker: Chansey*.

You can grab some gems if you have a strategy that relies on them such as Flying-gem Acrobatics or Unburden Normal-gem Fake Out.

With that out of the way, head back to the Tanzan Cove. Prepare your team for a battle and talk to Noel...

## Defending Belrose Manse

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Saphira you don't understand (-1 Saphira)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you want to beat Meteor faces (+1 Charlotte)

The story will diverge a little bit depending on what our choice was at Yureyu. This section gets a bit hairy since there are FOUR different story splits.

### Fought Sigmund at Yureyu Route Part 2

If you didn't fight Sigmund at Yureyu and instead fought Sirius, [jump to the next section](#didnt-fight-sigmund-at-yureyu-part-2).

Anyways, you'll have to first fight two orderlies.

</table></div>

On this route this is our first battle with Sirius, and we don't get a partner. His team is all about hitting hard with well-rounded coverage. In particular you have to watch out for his Chandelure, who is fast and can hit most types super effectively. Minior can set up if you have a bad lead against it, and Manectric uses fast offense and pivot moves. The rest are fairly slow. No field effect to worry about here, so pick your best counters to his team and you can overcome.

Afterwards, the game will give us another choice that affects the story! Either we will go upstairs or stay downstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Go Upstairs after fighting Sirius (+1 Charlotte, +1 Shelly, +1 Noel, -1 Saphira, -1 Laura, -1 Sigmund)
- Stay Downstairs after fighting Sirius (+1 Charlotte, +1 Shelly, +1 Saphira)

If you chose to stay downstairs the Twins will be captured. Talk to the group in the kitchen to the right.

If you go upstairs, this results in Laura being captured. Talk to Saphira downstairs.

</table></div>

This fight can be tough thanks to his usage of the very broken Psychic Terrain - it will double Musharna's speed, boost his Psychic attacks plus Hex, and make Hypnosis actually reliable. Consider knocking out Musharna, then trying to stall out the terrain to neutralize this strategy; alternatively, you can use Hex yourself to deal heavy damage. In the back is his Electivire, who is fast and hits hard with Ice Punch, so be careful with your Ground types. A well rounded team will be able to succeed with the right approach.

Afterwards, you will make another choice that will affect the game!

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to stop Sigmund after fighting him.**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Choose to stop Sigmund after fighting him (+1 Saphira, +1 Shelly, +1 Charlotte, +1 Noel, +1 Anna, +1 Shade, -1 Laura, -2 Sigmund)
- Choose to stop Sirius after fighting Sigmund (+1 Laura, -2 Saphira, -1 Noel)

If Saphira was abducted, you'll also see a hole in the wall that opens up. You can actually use the hole instead of the door to enter and exit.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Exit or enter the Belrose Manse through the hole in the wall (-1 Laura)

## Tanzan Meteor Base

With that, we can now enter the Tanzan Mountain and take back whoever you ended up getting kidnapped by Team Meteor.

Head into Tanzan Mountain and go to the right as soon as you can. Depending on your earlier choices either Laura or Saphira will be here. Talk to them and you will be able to use the rock to nicely remove the barrier or freely pass through it after Dragonite destroys it.

The next room contains a hidden *Green Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, and *Blue Shard*. Enter the base.

There will be a lot of these rotary thingies all over the base. Essentially they will send you 90 degrees in the indicated direction, but once you use it, it'll send you in the opposite direction next time. So, you'll only be able to go left for now.

Head up and into the room. This next room has tiles that will teleport you to the same color equivalent in a different room - and those in that room will teleport you back. You'll need to reach the top of each room to deactivate a panel. To succeed, one strategy is this:

Use the left panel, then go left, down, up, up and use the computer. Spam down and eventually you can return to the bottom of the room. Ensuring we are starting in the right room this time, use the right panel, then go right, down, up, up, and use this computer. Spam down, again use the white panels at the bottom to pop out in the right side.

Talk to the grunts and scientists up here and talk to the computers to open up the door at the top as well as a shortcut in the bottom-left corner. Talk to Simon here (he won't fight you) to start up a sidequest later.

Enter the door at the top!

## Tanzan Depths

If Saphira was abducted, you'll be here with Laura.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Laura in the depths (+2 Laura)

Go out and head up.

Another single Pokemon boss, this time with a Mega Steelix. Since it's slow you can wear it down with Special moves. Counter also works well if you can take a hit.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Steelix on the first try (+3 Saphira, +1 Laura)
- Beat Steelix on the second, third, etc. try (+2 Saphira)

Once you emerge, make your way back into the base and head to the back room. Once you do it will be time for another fight!

Seriously. Thankfully, when you're only fighting one Pokemon with very low HP that has to deal with recharge, you can find a way to open an opportunity to knock it out. Disabling Dark Pulse will let your Ghost type easily win. Alternatively Mirror Coat and Metal Burst can work great here. There's lots of options for this one.

Head all the way back to Tanzan Cove and talk to Anna inside. It's time for another gym battle!

Shocker, another tough gym leader in Pokemon Reborn. You'll notice that Noel uses Normal types on a field that doesn't really benefit most of his moves, instead, he'll mainly profit off of the free healing each turn. His seeded Clefable, Girafarig, and Bewear in particular are all fairly bulky and have good coverage to mess up your team. With the addition of a Porygon-Z who gets extra bulk thanks to its seed and hits like a truck and the demon spawn known as King's Rock Cinccino, you're in for a tough fight against a well-rounded Normal type team (ok, 5/6 of a Normal type team plus Clefable).

Clefable's Magic Guard is an annoying ability that means you need to overwhelm it physically despite its seed boost or get it before it can Calm Mind too much, but thankfully it means it doesn't have Unaware. This means you can get your own sweeper set up potentially against Bewear or Girafarig and maybe steamroll his team. Fighting types can potentially destroy the Cinccino but won't see a ton of success against the rest of the team. Since Normal types have no other weaknesses, you might have to turn to using the field to your benefit. Although Girafarig has Sap Sipper to absorb Grass type moves, you can go with a hyper-offensive Grass type strategy, keeping Swellow in mind. Coil and Growth are boosted on this field, so it shouldn't be impossible to set up. You can also take advantage of the boost to Fire-moves - in particular Bewear will get crushed by them. Keep in mind too that the Elemental Seed can potentially allow you to more easily survive Cinccino and/or get your own tank set up.

In a pinch, this fight becomes much easier if you change the field to the Burning Field or the Corrosive Field. However, Laura doesn't like you destroying her flower garden!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Noel on Burning Field (-2 Laura)
- Beat Noel on Corrosive Field (-1 Laura)

For winning, you'll get the *Standard Badge* which boosts our cap to 60. We'll also get *TM10 Hidden Power*!

# Episode 10: Into Darkness

Back inside, talk to the crew here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Laura on the couch (+1 Laura)

Next, talk to Noel in the stairs room. You'll hear a (non-Julia induced) boom, indicating it's time to return to Tanzan Mountain once more.

## Tanzan Mountain Boom and Goodies

Enter Tanzan Mountain and this time go to the left. You'll see a barrier is now destroyed, so follow the path. Snag a hidden *Potion*, *Green Shard*, and *Hyper Potion* then go up into the next room. Grab the *X Sp. Atk* and go up to find Saphira.

You'll get the *Ruby Ring* and *Amethyst Pendant*! Sweet.

There are also hidden *Ice Heal*, *Red Shard*, and *Revive* in this room. Meeting Saphira allows us to access a few more goodies in Tanzan Mountain before we proceed through the door at the top.

Make your way back to the meteor base on the right side and follow the path. In this first room you can find 2 hidden *Green Shards*, *Burn Heal*, *Potion*, and *Clever Wing*. Exit at the bottom left. This is the room where Steelix was tunneling previously. Going straight to the right, you'll find a *Metal Coat* - meaning you can now get your own Steelix!

Head left, up, and left again. You'll see a new cave entrance here. Inside you'll find the *Thick Club* as well as some mining rocks. Back outside this room, go up and walk across the iron girder, and enter the door to the next room.

Here you can grab an *Upgrade*.

That's all for Tanzan Depths for now, so you can Dig or Escape Rope to get back to Tanzan Mountain proper and go up from the area where you got the jewelry from Saphira.

It's almost like Fern was just waiting on the very edge of the map with Grassy Terrain to fight us! His Roserade and Decidueye are as always a tough combo: Roserade will put you to sleep, Decidueye will try to sweep, and both will sit back, passively heal, and enjoy the field boosts. His Rhydon is annoyingly tanky thanks to its Eviolite and has wide coverage but doesn't hit too hard. His Haxorus and Krookodile (and Scyther, I guess) will try to sweep you with attack / speed boosts.

A good sweeper can find some success if they resist Haxorus or Rhydon's attacks, but you'll have to watch out for Shadow Sneak. You can also mutate the field to Burning if you want, obviously neutering his Grass types instead of helping them. I'd make the case that Noel is overall a harder fight than Fern in general so by making it here you should be able to succeed.

So, now we get to explore Route 1. Only in Pokemon Reborn do we finally reach Route 1 after getting 7 badges.

You'll also find pairs of **Tauros** and **Bouffalant** all over the route. If you fight Tauros, the Bouffalant will go running off in the direction it's facing, which means that any logs in the way will be pushed. If you fight Bouffalant, Tauros will let you ride it, meaning you can now go up ledges. Game changer.

As a note: there are a bunch of entrances to the North and South Aventurine Woods scattered about Route 1. I'll take us into the woods to explore a bit later and focus on Route 1 for now.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_1.png"/>

Start by going left. Before hopping up or down any edges, you can find a hidden *Nugget* here. Head down one ledge to the left, in this "level" of the route, you can find hidden *Blue Shard*, *Red Shard*, and *Purple Shard*. Defeat the two circled Tauros here to cause Bouffalant to clear some paths for us, which will come in handy later on.

Head down the ledge to the left. On this level, you'll find hidden *X Sp. Atk*, *Elemental Seed*, and *Blue Shard*. Defeat the next circled Tauros to clear another path in the Aventurine Woods, then go down the next ledge. Up from here, defeat the Tauros (top left of the above image) to open a shortcut. You'll also find a hidden *Carbos* here.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_2.png"/>

Hidden to the left are a *Green Shard* and *Great Ball*. Hop down the ledge to the left to get hidden *Escape Rope*, *Blue Shard*, and *Grass Gem*. The Miltank around here will do a trade with us: one Oran Berry for its *Moomoo Milk*. Make sure you have at least one Moomoo Milk in your bag for a quest way later.

Anyways, head inside the building here.

Someone on the first floor will give us 8 *Honeys*. Useful for a quest we'll embark on in a bit. Upstairs someone will give us the password *allfieldapp*, and another person will tell us they lost their glasses. This will also be our main healing hub for now. Upstairs, you can do an in-game trade: our Dunsparce for **Tyrogue**. This is repeatable actually, so if you want to get more Tyrogue at higher levels for evolution purposes, you can do so. Grab the *Wide Lens* here as well.

Back outside, head down the ledge here. You'll find a hidden *Dragon Gem*. Down another ledge, you can grab a *Lax Mint* as well as a hidden *Magical Seed*.

You'll notice inside the gate at the bottom we can't do anything, so head back out. Knock out a Bouffalant to get a Tauros mount, which we can use to climb the ledges back up Route 1! Make your way back to where we fought Fern. You'll notice as you go that you will be unable to go through tall grass on your Tauros. The path through this section of woods on Tauros looks like the following:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_3.png"/>

Note that this means we do have to briefly enter the North Aventurine Woods to keep our mount - alternatively you could also climb the ledge near the youngster, dismount, then get a new Tauros mount to the right. This takes more time however, so I recommend the woods when traversing Route 1 here.

You can also find a hidden *Poke Ball* in here. Make your way out to the right and back onto Route 1, then proceed east.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_4.png"/>

To progress to the right while still on your Tauros, you'll need to have the top left Bouffalant move a log, so defeat Tauros. Hop up the ledge to the right.

You can find an *Exp. Candy L* as well as 2 hidden *Green Shards*, and *Electric Gem*. Note while you're here that you can pet Flareon, the first of many Eeveelutions we'll need to pet for that sidequest.

On the next ledge to the right you'll find a *Great Ball*, *Ether*, and *Tiny Mushroom*.

Defeat the two Tauros here to get Bouffalant to push more logs out of the way.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_5.png"/>

To the right you'll need to use the bottom of three ledges to make it to the right on your Tauros. Up here you'll find hidden *Great Ball* and *Super Potion*. The ledge to the right is the only one on the route that goes downwards. Jump down it.

You can find hidden *Chewing Gum*, *Telluric Seed*, *PP Up*, *Red Shard*, and *Heart Scale* in this area. You'll notice we can't access the walled off area at the bottom-right while on a Tauros, so we'll come back here later on. Knock out the Tauros in the top area and progress up the next hill.

On the next hill you can get a hidden *PokeSnax*, and *Purple Shard*.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_6.png"/>

Grab the hidden *Poke Ball* to the right. Use the bottom of two ledges to head up and grab a hidden *Dire Hit*, then head up once more. Pick up the hidden *Poke Ball*, *Red Shard*, and *Zinc*.

Grab the hidden *Ghost Gem*, 2 *Purple Shards*, and *Synthetic Seed*. In the bottom corner you can use Strength to get a *Protector*.

With that out of the way, dismount off your Tauros with 'A' and jump down the ledges down and to the left until we reach the secluded part we skipped earlier. Beat this final Tauros to move one more log, then grab the hidden *Super Repel*. Up above you should find another pair of fighting bulls - beat Bouffalant to get another Tauros mount, then return all the way to the right. We can't do anything in the top area for now, so head down and into the Vanhanen Labyrinth.

Grab the *Purple Shard* in a nearby rock then enter the castle.

Heal and prep your team, then enter the next room. Here we can pet Umbreon for the quest, but make sure you do this now since this is a limited time petting opportunity!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Luna's Umbreon (+1 Luna)

Anyways, talk to Luna.

This battle features the new Chess Board Field. While fields like Grassy Terrain and Super-Heated Field are fairly intuitive, you really should read up about Chess Board field as much as possible and use this battle to learn the ins-and-outs. Essentially, each team member will get a chess board piece rank that will affect various things like stat boosts and even priority. They are fixed for each ordered team, although some will change depending on ordering, so keep that in mind as you make a chess board team. Luckily, this means that the opponents' teams will always predictably use the same ranks, so I will list them for each major chess fight.

Anyways, with all that said, Cain doesn't really have a ton of optimization here with his team, although it is getting better. He now uses Mimikyu, which is always a bit annoying to fight thanks to its ability and optimal moveset. His Muk and Nidoking are strong as ever, and his Primarina and Marowak may be slow but will hit you really hard. The key to winning this one is probably just consistent fast offense with a couple of things in the back to deal with Mimikyu and Nidoking if need be.

Anyways, once you win, we can talk to Luna.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Luna after G. Gardevoir is captured (+1 Luna)

Head back out and talk to Radomus and Cain again. Then exit via the labyrinth, hop on a Tauros and make your way all the way down the route to the Grand Stairway that was empty earlier. Note that we will need to win another one of those "impossible story battles" coming up soon to keep open our options for a postgame route, so plan your team accordingly.

## Citae Astrae

Once you enter, you'll see El run to the left. Follow him, then talk to Radomus to jump down. You can find a hidden *Star Piece*. Talk to Radomus and go down. Grab the hidden *Stardust* and go down the ladder.

Hey look! We made it to another chunk of the grand stairway that we couldn't access earlier. Grab hidden *Burn Heal*, *Repel*, *Big Pearl*, *Full Heal*, and *Super Repel* as you make your way right. In the next room, pick up 3 hidden *Purple Shards*, then exit to the left. Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy L* and go down the ladder. In this room you can find a hidden *Stardust* and 3 *Star Pieces*. Go up and into the new area.

After a scene, you'll be free to explore.

In this area, you can find 5 hidden *Star Pieces*, *Shoal Shell*, and *Shiny Stone*. Say that ten times fast.

Enter the building here. We can use our Ruby Ring to access a door. Inside, you'll find the first of many of Reborn's logic-by-contradiction puzzles. The ones in here shouldn't be too crazy, so I recommend solving these yourself. Anyways, the answer:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Chimchar Dark, Monferno Dark, Infernape Light </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the Chimchar puzzle answer</a>
</div>

After the puzzle, go through the teleporter. You can actually make your way back through the purple teleporter to grab a *Exp. Candy XL*. With that, head up and into the door.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree to give Adrienn the ring (+1 Adrienn, -1 Cain)
- Refuse to give Adrienn the ring (-1 Adrienn, +1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Adrienn about the pronouns when the player is Non-binary (+1 Adrienn)

Note that we will eventually get points for free for being the other genders too. Enter the red door for another logic puzzle.

</div>

Use the Light Shard (or wait till we catch a few Pokemon) and head out.

Once you're ready, talk to El at the top. You will have to choice between siding with El, or Radomus. If you choose the former, you're allowed to lose the upcoming battle, but if you choose the latter, you must win to progress.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to side with Radomus and win.**

One thing to note is that Judgement will cycle between gaining Fire, Water, Grass, and Psychic type bonus damage. Using that fact, lowering its special attack, or using one of the strategies we've seen so far to deal with these 6v1 "impossible" fights should suffice if you want to win.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Side with El and lose (+3 Elias, +1 Adrienn, -3 Gardevoir, -2 Luna, -2 Radomus)
- Side with El and win (+1 Cain, +2 Elias, +2 Adrienn, -2 Gardevoir, -2 Luna, -2 Radomus)
- Side with Radomus and win (+2 Radomus, +2 Luna, +3 Gardevoir, +1 Anna, +1 Shade, +1 Cain, -1 Adrienn, -2 Elias)

With that, agree to leave together. Exit out of the Grand Gate, then make your way to Coral Ward. Talk to Adrienn here, then accept fast travel if you wish back to Vanhanen Castle. I will recommend not doing that so we can prep for an upcoming sidequest.

We're gonna need about 30 Honeys for the next section - I recommend buying only about 5 honeys and then making sure you have 8-9 candies in your bag, as we will be able to trade them for honey later. A single Blue Moon Ice Cream can also be exchanged for tons of Honey if you happen to have one.

Not that you should spend your money on them, but the Sweet Kiss now sells higher-tier Exp. Candies!

## North Aventurine Woods Exploration

Once you're ready, head to the Route 1 Nature Center, grab a Tauros mount, and go right.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_7.png"/>

Enter 1N, the first entrance to the forest that you see. This will simply spit us out at 2N. To the right, enter 3N.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/naw_1.png"/>

Go up and you'll find a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and a *Potion*. A web will block us from proceeding, so we'll have to dismount up here and walk through the tall grass to the left. You can talk to the tree (A) here to slather it with honey - when you do, Heracross and Pinsir will show up and fight for it. If you need a nearby web broken, defeat Pinsir and Heracross will do it for you. If you need a nearby log broken, defeat Heracross, and Pinsir will do it for you. Note that throughout the woods we cannot catch these two bugs. Anyways, defeat the Pinsir here.

Head to the right from here and go through another set of tall grass, but don't go down this ledge just yet. Throughout our adventures in the woods, if you appear to be stuck, step on the Red and White flower tile - don't pull out the Floral Charm just set, I'm saving that for a specific flower later on - and you'll be sent back to Route 1.

Down from here, you'll find a hidden *Mental Herb* and another honey tree (B). Interact with it twice and defeat both bugs to get a *Leaf Stone* and *TM86 Grass Knot*. Exit back to Route 1, hop on a Tauros, and head back into 3N. Pass tree A and climb the ledge, then dismount. Grab the hidden *Oran Berry* and *Elemental Seed* then enter Celestinine Mountain here.

Note that we will eventually want a Qwilfish for an in-game trade.

Grab the hidden *Ether* and *Repel*, then make your way to the ice puzzle. Slide your way to the center, then slide left and up from the top left part of the center to get the *Icy Field Readout*. Oh, and the Icy Rock to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is here as well. Slide to the left and down to head down some stairs from here.

Pick up an *Ice Stone* up here as well as a hidden *Potion*. You can also find *TM23 Smack Down* in here. Do some fishing if you'd like, then exit out to the woods the way we came in and return to Route 1.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_8.png"/>

Grab a Tauros mount and head east from 3N in search for 4N. Once you find it, head in.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/naw_2.png"/>

Grab the hidden *Dire Hit* and *Big Mushroom*. If you go up and left, "To C" on the map, you can reach a tree (C) from the previous map under which we can fight a Pinsir to open a shortcut, though this one isn't required to get any rewards. Head back to the right and go up, then dismount. Past the tall grass, you'll find some soil to plant berries in if you'd like as well as the *Pikanium-Z* and a *Green Shard*. Enter the building here.

A Pikachu on the ground floor is actually a tutor.

Talk to the guy upstairs - he will tell us he is the PC administrator, and also heal our Pokemon! You can also talk to him with candy or ice cream in your bag - he will give us 3 *Honeys* for each. If we give him *Blue Moon Ice Cream*, we'll get *40 Honeys*.

Back outside, go down then right. You'll see another Honey tree (D) - defeat Pinsir to clear some webs. Unless you really like the animation of Pinsir smashing logs, we can ignore the nearby short log. Grab the hidden *Burn Heal* and go up - we'll be blocked by long log for now! Exit to Route 1.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_9.png"/>

Hop on a Tauros, and enter 5N to the right. Pick up the hidden *Red Shard*, and witness the conversation to the right.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you did see that just now (-1 Titania)
- Say you didn't see that just now (-2 Titania)

To the right, 6N will spit us back out onto Route 1, so enter 7N to the east. Pick up the hidden *Paralyze Heal* and dismount, then go left and up. You'll find Honey tree E here - beat Heracross to clear a log to the left. Head back down and to the right here, then go up through the tall grass. There's another Honey tree (F) - beat Heracross again to clear a log.

Head back out to Route 1, and pick up a Tauros mount. Head right back in to 7N and go up the ledge at the top. Grab the *Sharp Beak* as well as hidden *Synthetic Seed* and *Tiny Mushroom*.

Finally, head back to Route 1, pick up a Tauros mount (if there are none, go west through 6N to 5N) and enter 4N once more. Follow the path to the right and go up the ledge here. Grab the *Exp. Candy XL*, *Calm Mint*, *Careful Mint*, and 2 *Lum Berries*. Also you can find hidden *Great Ball* and *Red Shard*. Return to Route 1.

## South Aventurine Woods Exploration

Getting everything in the South Aventurine Woods is a bit more complicated, so to make things easier, we will start at the rightmost entrance to the South Aventurine Woods first.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_9.png"/>

Head east on Route 1 and enter 8S in the above map, noting that you'll have to dismount in order to reach this woods entrance.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/saw_3.png"/>

Inside, grab the hidden *Revive* then use the Honey tree (Q) two times to destroy both of the nearby obstacles. Exit out of 8S, then go left to 7S. You can get a *Water Gem* here and exit on the other side at 6S. Our next destination is all the way to the west, so stop by the Route 1 Nature Center to heal if you'd like.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_7.png"/>

Enter 1S on the far west side of Route 1.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/saw_1.png"/>

Grab a hidden *Clever Wing* then go up the ledge and follow the path. Dismount, then talk to Honey tree (G) and beat the Pinsir. Down this ledge is 2S, which we can take to emerge onto Route 1. Find a Tauros mount and return to 2S.

Up the ledge to the right you'll find a hidden *Max Repel*. Dismount up here, then go down through the patch of tall grass. Use the Honey tree (I) and fight Pinsir. Make your way back to Route 1, grab a Tauros, then reenter 2S yet again. 

Go right at this fork, staying on Tauros to climb the ledge below tree (I). Dismount up here and go down through the tall grass. Use the Honey tree (H) and fight Heracross this time, then return to Route 1. One more time, get a Tauros and re-enter 2S.

This time, go down at the first fork. Follow the path and jump up the ledge at the bottom. Pick up the *Link Stone*, 2 *Sitrus Berries*, and hidden *Magical Seed*. Drop down and go up the ledge immediately to the right, then dismount. Pick up the hidden *Revive* in the next area, then use the Honey tree (J) and fight Heracross. Exit out of 3S above, get a Tauros mount, and return to 3S.

Go up the ledge at the bottom, use the Honey tree (K) and fight Pinsir. Grab the hidden *Purple Shard*. You'll notice we can't progress this way any further. Return to Route 1.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_8.png"/>

Next, we'll be entering 4S - you'll know you're in the right place if you recognized where we fought Fern.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/saw_2.png"/>

Anyways, lather the Honey tree closest to you (N) and fight Pinsir, then make your way right and dismount - don't go down the ledge to 5S though. Grab hidden *Escape Rope*, *Purple Shard*, and *Potion* then make your way down through the tall grass. At the bottom is another Honey tree (P); defeat Heracross here. Make your way back up partway through the tall grass and you'll notice an opening (orange in the above image). Pull out the Floral Charm when prompted to to battle **Flabebe**! Head straight to the right and grab the hidden *Oddishweed* in the bush. Head back and get lulled into a daze to return to Route 1.

Again, enter 4S, this time not needing a Tauros mount, and head down. Use the nearby Honey tree (M) two times to clear both obstacles. Go down and immediately to the right, use another Honey tree (O) and fight Heracross. Finally, head left and down the ledge and use the Honey tree nearest Tanzan (L) and fight Heracross. Follow the path to the left, and you'll emerge at 3S. 

Get a Tauros mount and reenter 3S, this time, going down and following the newly opened path. At a fork, you'll get *TM51*, 2 *Custap Berries*, and a hidden *Telluric Seed*. Make sure you save one of these Custap Berries for a quest later on.

Follow the path to the right and up. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Star Piece* along the way. Go left at the fork and pick up the *Tech Glasses* as well as a hidden *Repel* and *Link Stone*, then head right.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/saw_3.png"/>

Grab the hidden *Fire Gem*. Down the ledge you'll finally see why I had us do 8S first... anyways follow the path right then go up. Get the hidden *PP Up* and finally dismount, then head up into the grass.

Here, you can grab a *Razor Claw* and *TM40 Aerial Ace* as well as hidden *Silver Powder* and *Magical Seed*. You'll also find a Heracross and a Pinsir here, but you need to choose. To get **Heracross** defeat the Pinsir, and to get **Pinsir** defeat the Heracross. We'll be able to obtain the other later.

That wraps up our exploration of the woods!

Return to the Route 1 Nature Center and talk to the guy on the second floor who lost his specs. In exchange for the Tech Glasses we will get *Department Store Sticker: Heracross*!

## Grand Hall Trainers 5

With that out of the way, you can use the Tauros shortcut just north of the Grand Gate to make your way to Vanhanen Castle once more.

## Millenium Badge

After talking to the group at the entrance, go up two rooms. Radomus will explain the puzzle. Enter the room on the left and grab a *Psychic Memory*.

Talk to Elias here for more details on the puzzle, etc.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Ask Elias about himself (+1 Elias)

The screen in here will also tell us what our current team chess piece ranks would be in its current ordering, useful for planning for the upcoming fight.

Anyways, it's time to clear all the chess puzzles. I will spoiler the solutions.

Especially if you've played previous versions, you'll notice that Radomus' team on top of his field is able to get up 8-Turn Trick Room almost always, since his two leads both have it and get a Focus Sash effect as pawns. Then, with their low speed advantage, Malamar will then usually go for its Contrary Superpower set up, while Reuniclus will try to hit insanely hard  with Psychic/Rock type boosted Psychic. His Gallade gets attack on switch in, has lots of coverage, and can use a boosted Rock type Strength, while his Metagross gets free +1 Priority on all of its hard-hitting attacks including Strength and Meteor Mash. Slowking gets defensive boosts upon switch in and can even set up Nasty Plot, and essentially outspeeds everything under Trick Room, which it has as a backup. Finally, his Gardevoir is EV trained, a bit tanky thanks to Queen bonuses, has a berry,  hits really hard with boosted Psychic, and can also set up on you. A stacked team that has a tendency to completely steamroll the unprepared under Trick Room.

One strategy you can try to use to win is to shut down Trick Room altogether. Using moves like Fake Out, Taunt, Spore, etc. will allow you to stall the Trick Room users long enough that you can hopefully knock them out on the second or third turn with super-effective Bug/Dark/Ghost moves. Successfully defeating both leads before Trick Room allows you to exploit the low speeds! Metagross will still have priority and Slowking can use Trick Room when it comes in, so be careful of that. If that isn't working, you can also bring an Oranguru from the forest and use Trick Room yourself to cancel it at any time. Alternatively, aside from Slowking and Reuniclus, the rest of his team has respectable base speed, so you can potentially win (lose?) the speed race and bring your own super slow team. Knocking out Reuniclus turn one or two will then mean your slower Pokemon may go first over everything except Metagross and Slowking. A Pokemon like Escavalier is great in this context.

Your team composition with respect to chess pieces is going to important regardless of your speed strategies. For your leads, take two Pokemon that can get you momentum for your strategy, keeping in mind that they're guaranteed to live one hit each as Pawns. Then, you're going to want your hardest hitting Pokemon or one that desperately needs priority to be a King if possible, though without a King's Rock at this point, this can be tough to arrange. The rest of your team will naturally fall into Rook/Bishop/Queen - save a bulky but strong attacker for the latter, and consider a Synthetic Seed if you have a special-attacking Bishop. If you happen to have a Pokemon with speed as its best stat, it will become a Knight and can be a great choice to OHKO Queen Gardevoir. Using the field notes, rearrange your team with respect to chess pieces accordingly.

You can exploit the Chess Board in other ways as well: you can use Strength/Secret Power yourself for a field boost. These moves will shoot through the roof in power if you can confuse your opponents with something like Teeter Dance first. You also get a boost when using Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, which you can use to ignore Trick Room speed tiers entirely and net some easy KO's against his frail Psychic types. Defensively, you can use Pokemon with Adaptability, Telepathy, Anticipation, or Synchronize to eat Radomus' Psychic and Strength attacks. And of course, there is always the angry child approach of using Stomping Tantrum to flip the board and go to a neutral field.

Once you win, you'll get the *Millenium Badge* which pushes our cap up to Lv. 65 as well as *TM92 Trick Room*. Trick Room is a top 5 TM in the game due to its ability to reverse the sweeping power of speedy enemy field-boosted threats, so it's fantastic that we get it for the rest of the game!

# Episode 11: Out of Light

After everything goes dark, head out of the gym. Once you get outside, use the Light Shard and head out into the labyrinth.

## Seventh Street

If you haven't completed the [gang sidequest](#joining-a-gang) up until now, you'll need to do that now.

Talk to your gang leader, and they will tell you about Seventh Street. To reach it with Aqua Gang, use the top left house in Lapis, with Magma Gang, use a house on the left in the center of Lapis.

Wander around the area and defeat all the trainers. Note that you'll only need to fight the Aqua Gang members if you're in Magma Gang and vice versa. From top to bottom:

Hidden around the map you'll find 2 *Purple Shards*, *Common Candy*, 2 *Blue Shards*, 2 *Green Shards*, *Pecha Berry*, *X Sp. Atk*, 2 *Red Shards*, and *Calcium*. The house in the middle of the top contains a healing point and PC. Talk to all of the NPC's in the area and you'll learn about what you can get down here in 7th.

Towards the top of the map you'll find an *Ability Capsule* salesperson. They'll trade you one for first 1, then 2, and from then on 3 shards of a random color. Useful! Up and to the right we'll find a couple of tutors.

None of these are mindblowing, but some of them can be useful for certain strategies. As usual, these are pay once, relearn forever.

The guy to the right is selling random stuff:

<div class="shop_section"><table>

Pricey, but we finally have the ability to get as many data chips as we want for password inputs. We will also want a Magnet Powder for a quest later. There is another seller in the bottom left corner.

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Seventh Street Misc. Wares (Left)</strong></th></thead>

Grab a Soul Candle and a Stick for later quests.

To the right, you'll see one of your gang members making a sale:

<div class="shop_section"><table>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Blast Powder</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$2000</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

Blast Powder will essentially let us mine all the mining rocks a second time. Buy at least 5 for now since there are a few things actually gated behind the mining rocks we'll want to grab, but getting more won't hurt. For what it's worth, saving in front of a rock until you find a Star Piece or Rare Bone in the rubble you can guarantee a return on investment for these things.

Enter the cage area in the bottom right corner. Here, a guy will be selling all of the Pokemon we previously worked with in the Blacksteam Meteor Factory.

<td style="text-align: center">9 Red Shards</td>

</table></div>

There is a sidequest later with a fantastic reward that will involve returning specifically Vanillite, Loudred, Roggenrola, Jigglypuff, and Makuhita to their original owners. I recommend breeding these Pokemon if you want to use them long term, keeping the originals in your PC.

If you've been picking up hidden items and mining most of the rocks, you should have enough shards to get every Pokemon here, but you can always come back later to complete this quest. From now on, shards will mainly be useful only for unlocking tutors and buying Ability Capsules.

If you've kept up so far with the game-spanning quest, beginning with our purchase of a mystery Pokemon from the Grand Hall, you can now continue it. For just 2 Blue Shards, you can buy back your Pokemon... just kidding, it gets stolen again!!!

Anyways, exit this area. Once you buy all of the Pokemon, DJ Arclight will give you a *Lucky Egg*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Buy all of the seventh street stolen Pokemon (+1 Arclight)

The house above is the Pokemon Psychologist. For just two Heart Scales (which we can find in rocks everywhere) we can change the nature of a Pokemon to whatever we want, meaning we don't need to rely on finding mints anymore. Keep the mints you find though as they can help you switch abilities on the go if you need a speed boosting nature for a specific fight or something similar.

Enter the nearby grotto on the right. Note that there is a sneaky hidden item behind a trainer on the left, so make sure you draw him out at least 1 tile when he notices you in order to get it.

Anyways, hidden in this room is *Black Glasses*, *Red Shard*, and *Exp. Candy XL*.

North of the top tutors, you'll see a shadow indicating an entrance. Inside, talk to the green machine to get a *Synthetic Seed*. Talk to the researcher on the left for a battle.

Defeat the researcher in here and agree to participate in her sidequest.

First, you'll need to bring her a Carvanha. Note that these will be gone forever. We can fish one in the nearby Lapis Alleyway. Next, you'll need an Unfezant. You can get Tranquill on the Onyx Rooftop: evolve it at Lv. 31 to get **Unfezant**, then donate it. Finally, we'll need Luxray. You can get Shinx in the Game Corner, evolve it at Lv. 15 then again at Lv. 30 to get **Luxio** then **Luxray**. Donate the latter. Exit Seventh to Lapis Ward, then come back down. Save the game and talk to Nadira. You'll be able to catch **Type: Null**, our first legendary!

On the north side of the main part of seventh, talk to your gang member and he'll mention seeing Bennett in the watering hole. Enter the watering hole, heal if you want, then head out and into the grotto on the right.

Grab the hidden *Blue Shard* then talk to Bennett here.

Back outside, a door will be open above you. Head up and to the right. You'll find a mining rock - break it and then use Blast Powder, then pick up the hidden *'Rare Candy'*. Head back to Seventh and it will be stolen! Head all the way to the bottom left of the area and you'll find the thief. Battle him to get it back.

Enter the top grotto and give it to a guy to obtain **Piplup**!

Reenter the narrow hole in the wall. You can find hidden *Purple Shard* and *Chewing Gum* as you go left. Enter the room in the bottom left!

## Subseven Sanctum

You'll be moved to a cage. Read the green book here - in fact, read every green book you see around this dungeon. Keep note of what the scripture says as well as the numbers at the end.

Head out once Klefki opens the door. Welcome to Reborn's stealth section!

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/subseven_mess.png"/>

In the artistic masterpiece above, the red entities are the guards, as well as their view ranges. The yellow paths indicate the movement patterns and view changes of certain guards, and the blue line represents the path the player must take. I recommend saving often, specifically at the blue blobs. If you get caught, just reload to save yourself the time. You might also want to turn off speed-up.

Enter the door on the right side while traversing the maze. While inside, read these books and grab the *Spell Tag* and *Holy Field Readout*.

Back outside, sneak past the nearby guard by going up at the right time, then go left when you can. You'll notice you can't go too far left, so you'll need to time going down past a patrolling guard, then once he passes you, go up, left, and down so he can't see you anymore. From here, head left once he moves back to the right, but don't go too far left.

Past the locked door on the left, you'll need to go up straight towards a guard who rotates, but you can't see his full sprite. This might take a couple of resets, but you'll need to perfectly time going up and then left based on whether you are seeing the front or back of the legs of the sprite.

Once you take the stairs at the top, the guards will all leave, so you can now navigate this room as you like without getting caught.

In the next room, there are grunts to fight. Going clockwise around the outside of the room first:

Another battle with Meteor's Ace themselves, and the first boss fight on the Holy Field. Read up on the Field Notes and you can do it!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Ace Loyalty (+1 Ace, -1 Elias)
- Tell Ace Blood (+1 Elias, -1 Ace)

Back outside in the Beryl Wall, another conversation will occur.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Luna you are afraid of the dark (-1 Luna)
- Tell Luna you aren't afraid of the dark after siding with El (Neutral)
- Tell Luna you aren't afraid of the dark after siding with Radomus (+1 Luna)

You'll then get the *Red Crystal Key*! Don't accept Cain's fast travel request - we can finish a few things up down in Seventh, plus getting to Vanhanen Labyrinth is now easy thanks to the circling Tauros.

## A Cult and a Gang: Sidequests

There are a few sidequests we can take care of in and around Seventh. First, head right back into the Subseven Sanctum and talk to the pentagram thing. With a Soul Candle in our bag, we'll be able to catch **Litwick**.

Back in seventh, the house in the bottom left corner will now be unlocked. If you have a Helix Fossil and do not have a Dome Fossil in your bag, the Twitch Plays Pokemon cultist will ask us to bring a Farfetch'd to him. Do so, and you'll get a choice between the *Sail Fossil* and the *Jaw Fossil*. Since we already have Amaura, no point in getting the former, so pick up the Jaw.

Although we now have both Amaura and a Jaw Fossil, it's worth noting that the cultist will ask for a Pidgeot in exchange for another fossil. Afterwards, you can trade Helix Fossils for more Jaw and Sail fossils if you want more.

Back outside, if you haven't already seen the scene, walk south from the psychologist towards the Pokemon sellers to see Madame Craudberry storm off. Your gang leader will tell you to meet at her house, so exit to Lapis and do so.

If this was a normal Pokemon game, this fight would be pretty hard relative to the others. However this is Pokemon Reborn: her team doesn't even have much synergy. No field, no weather, nothing. Just 5 annoying but beatable EV trained Pokemon.

Archer uses his rain team once more, but you'll notice it's not really optimized. His Pelipper is the only mechanism to summon rain, and the rest of his Pokemon have no rain-boosted abilities. So it's really just a weak Water-monotype team that you should be able to deal with. Sharpedo can be deadly with Speed Boost and priority, but everything else is slow.

For winning, you'll get *TM18 Rain Dance*.

You'll also notice that since Maxwell is gone from the North Obsidia Ward, you can now grab the hidden *X Attack* behind him and get another Houndour.

Maxwell uses his sun team once more, but you'll notice it's not really optimized. His Ninetales is the only mechanism to summon sun, and the rest of his Pokemon have no sun-boosted abilities past Charizard. So it's really just a weak Fire-monotype team that you should be able to deal with once the sun is gone. Houndoom and Charizard can hit pretty hard but exploiting the team's many weaknesses shouldn't be too tough.

For winning, you'll get *TM11 Sunny Day*.

## Iolia Valley

Head over to Vanhanen Labyrinth. Hidden behind the big tree in the top right is the entrance to Iolia Valley. Talk to the red gem to create a rock smash wall. Head through the path.

Exit at the bottom. In the next area, grab the hidden *Purple Shard* then make a new cave entrance. Finally, grab the hidden *Green Shard* and pick up the *Green Crystal Key*.

Make your way all the way back to the entrance of the valley. On the second tier you'll see a glowing green crystal which we can now activate to turn hedges into Rock Smash gems. Sometimes when you smash these, you'll get *Green Shards*.

Go down from here and use the red key to open a new door. Past the cave you can find a hidden *Red Shard* and the *Blue Crystal Key*.

Once again return to the entrance of the valley. Talk to the glowing blue crystal by the water to activate it and make an ice bridge.

On the other side of the water, go up first, then follow the path, using your keys. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Blue Shard* along the way. Activate the green crystal at the end, then return to the ice bridge and go down. Along this path, grab the hidden *Green Shard* and *Magical Seed*. Once you enter your newly created cave entrance, Bennett will confront you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett you will let him do what he has to (+1 Bennett)
- Tell Bennett you will not let him do what he has to (-1 Bennett)

Grab the *Purple Crystal Key*! Talk to the nearby purple crystal to mutate the cave. Outside the new exit, you can get a hidden *Red-Hots* and *X. Sp Atk*. In the next red cave, use the crystal to mutate another cave. Return all the way to the northmost ice bridge.

Head up and right from here, and enter the cave. Mutate this cave with the purple crystal, then head out the new exit. Pick up the hidden red shard and enter the red cave at the top. Inside, grab the *Dark Memory* and the *Dark Crystal Cavern Field Readout*. If you have Dark Pulse or Night Daze on one of your Pokemon, there is one more thing we can do here. Use it in a wild encounter to transform the Crystal Cavern to a Dark Crystal Cavern to get Sableye. Note that we'll get the former as a TM pretty soon, so you can do this part later if you wish.

Back outside, make your way to the entrance to the valley once more. Enter the cave on the second tier, and activate the purple crystal to mutate it. Head back out and enter the cave on the first tier from the left, and head out the newly formed exit. You'll find a *Dusk Stone* and a hidden *Rawst Berry*.

To progress, return to the entrance, un-mutate the cave we just mutated via the second tier, then go through the cave on the first tier once more. Follow this path to a Light Shard, then create another red cave entrance and go in.

Poor guy couldn't even level his Larvesta up once more to have Volcarona. Regardless, he benefits from the field he's on, this time in the form of boosted Signal Beams. Again his bugs are fairly frail and have lots of exploitable weaknesses, so you can use Rock and Fire moves to defeat him.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Bennett on your first try (+1 Luna, -2 Bennett)

## Blast Powder and Crystal Key Goodies

With that, we are able to challenge Luna. There are actually a few things we can do now that we have a few blast powders and the crystal keys. Skip ahead if you just wanna do the fight now.

There should now be a purple warp in Luna's room that will take us to the entrance of Iolia Valley. Convenient!

Head out of Iolia Valley and make your way through South Aventurine Woods to the Tanzan Mountain. Go right when you can into the room that Saphira burst out of earlier. You can use the green key to open a new pathway.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/tanzan_east.png"/>

Hop across some sneaky ledges onto the rocky texture of the cave, then make your way down and to the right. Exit onto the Chrysolia Pass.

Pick up a hidden *Hyper Potion* and *Normal Gem* as you make your way south. In the next two rooms, move boulders out of the way and grab the *Escape Rope*. The large room is a bit harder: you'll need to carefully move boulders and touch all three of the canisters to turn them red without getting stuck. If you need to, you can exit the room to reset. The room looked like this when I solved it:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/wasteland_wall_boulders.png"/>

Once you succeed, exit through the newly opened door. Head down the nearby ladder: this next puzzle will involve pushing boulders down holes to break rocks, and going up ladders. To go up, use the ladders on the left side of the area.

The sequence of steps to finish the puzzle should look something like this:

- Go down the first ladder to the left
- Head to the right and fall down the hole.
- Push this boulder all the way to the right into the hole, then jump down.
- Push the boulder to the right and climb up this ladder.
- To the right, climb the ladder.
- Push the boulder to the left into the hole and follow it in.
- Ignore the boulder on the left, instead go to the right and jump in the hole.
- Go left into the next hole. You'll 'respawn' to the ladder.
- Go to the right and jump twice into the holes.
- Climb the ladder to the right.
- Push this boulder all the way right into the hole, then follow it in.
- Push the boulder to the right side of the ladder, then climb up three times.

Once you finish this puzzle and emerge on top of the wall, head left to get the *Inverse Field Readout*. Right from here, there is a hidden cave entrance behind the canister. Inside, you can get the *Toxic Orb* and *Yureyu Key*. You can also talk to the canister here to fight **Dhelmise**. Exit to Tanzan Mountain... backtracking the entire way.

While we're nearby, head over to Spinel Town. We can revive the Jaw Fossil we got earlier to obtain **Tyrunt**!

The next two have a very high time-taken to value-of-reward ratio... but for completeness I'll get 'em anyways. Our first destination is Byxbysion Wasteland. Using the tunnels, make your way all the way back to the room where we fought Mr. Bigglesworth once upon a time. You can use your Blast Powder to access a *Dawn Stone*.

Secondly, take the boat to Apophyll Beach and enter Apophyll Cave. On the left side you can now use the powder to access a hidden *Max Revive*.

Ok, with those out of the way, head to the Underroot in Beryl. You'll see a green crystal on the right side of the area, so activate it. Cutting some wiggly trees here will allow us to get the *Ampharosite* as well as the *Meadow Plate* and an **Axew** egg. Sweet.

Head over to the Yureyu Abandoned Power Plant where we once fought Shade. Head to the right and around to the top, then use the Yureyu Key to get the *Magnet* and the *Ghostium-Z*. Sweet. Next, head around to the other side of the factory and again use the Yureyu Key to get inside.

Each of the Poke Balls in this room is an Electrode. Defeat all of them then talk to the monitor at the top for a battle with **Rotom**.

While we're in the Beryl area, head over to the Beryl Cemetery. If you talked to Simon in the Tanzan Meteor Base, you'll see him here. Talk to him to continue his sidequest - then head down to the building to the right of the Peridot Ward Pokemart to talk to him once more. That's all we can do with this quest for now.

## Eclipse Badge

Return to the Iolia Valley and take the warp to Luna's room.

Time to fight Reborn's Dark type gym leader. Offensively, the field will boost the power of Dark Pulse and Night Slash by 1.5x. More notable is that the field boosts the defenses of Dark types by 1.5x, so what'd normally be straightforward super-effective kills on Bisharp, Tyranitar, Absol, Weavile, and Honchkrow now aren't so certain. Not to mention the effect this has on already very bulky Umbreon, who can heal 75% of its health with Moonlight and also boost its Evasion. Plus, they all have perfect IV's and are all EV trained, a feature we'll see sticking around with the boss fights. Anyways, this is a pretty straightforward albeit tough fight that uses offensive and defensive boosts provided by the field pretty well.

The good news is that by this point you should have lots of options to deal with the team. If you want to stay with the Dark Crystal Cavern field, you can use Aurora Veil without needing Hail, or use your own Dark types to get the defense boosts. Dazzling Gleam and Signal Beam get boosted on this field, effectively cancelling out the defenses boost of her team if you use these moves. If you can get around Honchkrow, Fighting types and Bug types with high attack can generally succeed here too in spite of the added defense. You can also take advantage of the fact that she has a singular special move on her entire team and bring a team with lots of Defense to go blow-for-blow.

There are also merits to changing the field. For one, simply by setting sun you'll switch the field to Crystal Cavern, a field which is more neutral and lets you use Dragon type moves more effectively if you'd like. A special shoutout goes to Nature Power which turns into Power Gem on this field, a perfect counter to Sucker Punch Honchkrow. Alternatively, you can use one of the Earthquake-esque moves to switch over to a Cave Field, allowing you to sidestep the enemy bulk and power up Rock moves - only Bisharp resists them. With the Earthquake-esque moves, boosted Rock type moves, boosted Hyper Voice and Boomburst, there are powerful options on Cave. In either case Tyranitar will still be a menace, but can be taken down with a strong Fighting move.

Once you succeed, you'll get the *Eclipse Badge* which boosts our cap to Lv. 70, coincidentally about the point where normal Pokemon games just... end. Plus, she'll give us *TM97 Dark Pulse*! Nice.

# Episode 12: Demarcation

Exit Luna's gym. **If you head up to the Agate City entrance and go through, we'll actually be locked out from coming back to every area we've been to so far for about 4 badges worth of content.** Before we do so, there are a few sidequests and stuff to grab before continuing.

## 9 Badge Quests

Thanks to the Dark Pulse TM, you can now transform the field in the cave on the eastern side of Iolia Valley to get Sableye a bit easier, so take care of that if you'd like.

Next, make your way to Seventh Street. In the middle of the area you'll see a woman pleading for some medicine for her sleeping husband. Give her the Oddishweed we found earlier in exchange for an egg which will hatch to be **Chespin**.

With that out of the way, if you'd like, take some time to prepare for the next section of the game. Notably we won't have access to the Department Store or the Daycare. We also won't be able to catch new members for our team aside from what's available beyond, so stock up on items and do all the breeding and catching you need to.

Once you're all set, make your way to the Agate City checkpoint north of the Vanhanen Labyrinth, talk to Cain, then head out at the top.

## Agate Circus

After our first introduction to Terra in Agate City... we get to explore the Agate Circus! This area will serve as our "home base" of sorts while we obtain the next few badges. There are trainers scattered about as well as a healing component in the bottom of the area. The trainers on the map, roughly clockwise:

Next, you'll find an NPC who will change your Pokemon's Hidden Power type in exchange for a Heart Scale. Score another point for Reborn for "actually letting you customize any Pokemon" to let you win with your favorites. Past her is a nickname changer, also obsolete thanks to the party menu.

To the left is another tile puzzle, which you can play in exchange for 1 Red Shard. This is the solution:

The Blue Moon Ice Cream shows up rarely with the same mechanics as before.

There is another tile puzzle here, but this one has different mechanics. I recommend saving beforehand so if you get stuck you don't have to waste a shard when you reset. It costs 1 Purple Shard. Anyways, the finished puzzle looks like this:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/conkeldurr.jpg"/>

Once you win, you'll get a **Timburr**!

Next to this you'll find the High Striker. It costs $350 to play each time.

|High Striker Reward  |Chance |
|---------------      |-------|
|*TM87 Swagger*       |2%     |
|**Clefairy**         |14%    |
|Money back           |22%    |
|Nothing              |62%    |

After you've gotten the grand prize, from then on it will be replaced with getting your money back and winning a *Poke Doll*. After getting Clefairy, you will win an actual *Poke Doll* from then on. There's a secret here too: if you do this with a pokemon with Huge Power, Guts, Pure Power, or Sheer Force at the front of your party, you will always get the jackpot!

Once you get a Poke Doll, give it to a child below the healing component to get the *Big Top Arena Field Readout*.

Enter the gate on the right side that we came in from. Upstairs, a girl will take four Shoal Salts and four Shoal Shells and make us a *Shell Bell*! To her right, there is a clown who gives us a riddle. Solve the riddle for an in-game trade: our Stunfisk for his **Vulpix**!

Back outside, talk to the ringmaster in the upper left corner. Make your way to the cotton candy vendor to get a *Cotton Candy* for free.

Finally, talk to Samson next to the high striker.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Samson as he clears the way, when the player is female (+1 Samson)

Head in to the Big Top, and talk to Aya on the couch. After a conversation you'll get the *Powder Vial*.

Head out, then come back in to have some conversations for relationship points if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Aya (+1 Aya)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Cain (+1 Aya)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Ciel (+2 Samson, -1 Ciel)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Samson (+2 Ciel, -1 Samson)

While we're in the big top, if you talk to a clown in the audience, they'll fight you.

Make your way to the bottom left of the circus, grab the hidden *Fighting Gem*, and go in. Inside, a child will ask for a Cotton Candy, then an Air Balloon, then a Poke Doll. Once you give all the items to the kid their scheme will be revealed, and we will get *Department Store Sticker: Clefairy*.

## Clown Indra Fights

Before we proceed, one more thing to note in the circus is the colorful clown in the upper-right part of the area: Clown Indra. Without access to the Grand Hall trainers, he is our best option for grinding. Upon winning, we will get 8 *Exp. Candy L* and a randomly colored *Shard*. Note that he will battle you with a randomly chosen team from a pool which is as follows:

If you go up from here you'll find a hidden *Telluric Seed*, but can't progress farther. So, we'll have to jump over some rocks to the left. Using the cliff and the rocks, you can hop any two-tile-length gaps. Head up once you're in the northern area. You'll notice a green tree and a red tree. The green trees drop Sleep Powder and the red trees drop Rage Powder, both of which can be contained in the Powder Vial. The former can be used to put Crustle to sleep while the latter will wake them up and allow us to battle them! Note that if you hop onto a rock with a narrow base of support, the powder will spill out.

Grab some sleep powder and talk to the rock towards the top to summon a Crustle. Talk to it to put it to sleep, then push it to the right side so that it falls into the hole. A precise guide to moving this first Crustle:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Right 3, Up 1, Right 4, Up 2, Right 3, Up 1, Right 5, Down 2, Right 3
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 1 movements</a>
</div>

Grab some more sleep powder then head to the bottom right corner of this level. You'll find a rock with some stairs that let us climb up onto the rocks, so do so. Hop left then immediately down onto a cliffside. To the left from here you'll find a hidden *Link Stone*. Back near the stairs, make your way to the top left side of this area, carefully avoiding the wobbly rocks. On the higher platform, talk to the rock to summon a Crustle, then push it into the hole at the top of this area. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Left 4, Up 8, Right 1, Up 4, Right 1, Up 3
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 2 movements</a>
</div>

Make your way back down to the larger area, get another dose of sleep powder, then return to the upper left area with the previous Crustle.

Climb onto the white rock via the stairs then go right for a hidden *Ability Capsule*. Go to the left and use the cliff to hop over to the rock face up and to the right. Use the sleep powder on the Crustle in the nearby rock, then push this Crustle off the ledge to the right. This is a bit of a tricky maneuver - keep in mind that you can hop your way around to get a better angle. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Left 2, go up the stairs, hop up and around to get on top of Crustle, Down 1, take the stairs to the left up, hop down, hop your way to the rightmost stairs, Right 3, Down 1.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 3 movements</a>
</div>

From here, climb the stairs, hop down, make your way down the first ledge on the gray rock face and hop to the right onto the rock with stairs.  You'll need to finish moving the Crustle we previously knocked down the cliff into the hole at the top. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Right 2, Down 1, Right 2, Up 3, Left 1, Up all the way
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 3 movements (pt. 2)</a>
</div>

Climb up the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Green Shard*.

Hop across Crustle to go left at the top. Pick up *TM58 Sky Drop* and a hidden *Super Potion*. To the left across the final Crustle you can get a hidden *Ether* and *Purple Shard*. Head into the mountain here.

Without Surf we can't really do much here other than catch some Water and Ice type Pokemon, so head back out onto Route 2.

Make your way back to the platform with the powder trees by hopping down across two Crustles and going to the left, then hopping your way down and to the right. From the rock with stairs in the bottom right corner, go up and right to hop across to the platform on the right.

Pick up another hidden *Guard Spec.* Down the nearby stairs, you can walk through the valley between the rocks to climb the stairs in the bottom right corner. Up from here, talk to the green part of the locked gate on the right side to open up this shortcut!

To the right from here, go down and grab hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *Revive*. Can't go further, so head back up to the gate, then go down the stairs below.

Grab a hidden *Ultra Ball* then hop across some rocks to the right to grab a *Exp. Candy XL*. Next, hop to the left from the cliff at the top, grab a hidden *PokeSnax*, and hop your way to the bottom right side of the area. Climb down the stairs on the rock.

Snag the *Blue Shard* to the left, then get some sleep powder and talk to Crustle up and to the right. We'll need to move it down and right. Precisely:

Go down the stairs here, then pick up a hidden *Red Shard* in this lower area near the green tree. Grab some sleep powder and put the Crustle in the bottom right corner to sleep. We'll need to push it off a cliff down and to the left. Precisely:

The ringmaster has a team of circus-themed Pokemon that like to use the field effect well! You'll have to watch out for her boosted sound moves like Snarl and Sparkling Aria, as well as Blaziken getting +3 with Swords Dance on top of Speed Boost. If you can manage to not get swept by Blaziken, with some coverage you can probably find a way through this one.

Enter the circus back room. Once more we can have multiple conversations for relationship points.

Ooh boy, time for Samson. When I first played Reborn I was stuck on this fight for weeks! For one, 10 of his 24 moves are "high-striker" moves, meaning they get multiplied by a random multiplier between 0.5x and 3x. However, his Hariyama and Conkeldurr are guaranteed high rolls due to their abilities, and any Pokemon with increased attack also has a better chance at high rolls, meaning Synthetic Seed Hawlucha and Blaziken as well as Swords Dance Lucario all get really high rolls! Essentially this means that most of the time you get hit by a high striker move, you are going to be absolutely bodied! On top of this, Lucario's Swords Dance boosts attack by 3 stages per use, and its Acrobatics will hit with 165 base power regardless of item held! With Conkeldurr sitting at 90 total speed to counter Trick Room and Hawlucha with Unburden to outspeed basically anything you have, his team is well suited to deal with all kinds of speed set ups and easily crush your pathetic Pokemon with high striker moves. Thanks to Brick Break, your puny screens will be crushed as well. All in all a tough fight!

Ok, so Samson crushed me when I was younger, but that was before I read the field notes for Big Top Arena and realized how much you can do back to him! If nothing else, notice that what I mentioned about his Lucario's Acrobatics earlier holds true for you as well - the move pretty much wipes his whole team if you are able to use it (or Nature Power, which becomes it). You can also use the High Striker moves yourself to hit hard if you want - notable users include Guts Medicham, Guts / Sheer Force Conkeldurr, and Sky Drop Sheer Force Braviary, all of which are available nearby! There are also a ton of moves that are boosted on this field otherwise: sound moves like Hyper Voice and Boomburst, and other moves like Petal Dance, Power Whip, Fly, and Revelation Dance, to name a few. Speaking of the latter, a Pokemon with Dancer gets +1 Spe and +1 SpA whenever they use a dancing move... a good combo there for a certain Pokemon. If you are able to get away with boosting yourself, Swords Dance, Dragon Dance, and Quiver Dance are all boosted, meaning you can get your own sweeper going fairly easily. Rain lasts 8 turns, Sing has perfect accuracy now, Belly Drum grants defense boosts... there are just so many crazy things that you can use on this field! Even if you don't want to abuse the field, fast Psychic and Flying types are still solid choices to deal with his slower team members and you can always use something like priority moves or Sturdy + Counter for the tricky ones if need be.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Samson on your first try (+2 Ciel)
- Defeat Samson on your second, third, etc. try (-1 Ciel)

Once you win, you'll get the *Strike Badge* and *TM31 Brick Break*.

Hidden on this floor you'll find 7 *Shoal Salts*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Potion*, *Revive*, *Normal Gem*, and *Heart Scale*, though the latter requires use of a Blast Powder.

On the top there is a ladder that will take us to a different side of the familiar 2F. Up here you'll find a hidden *Zinc*, and *Ultra Ball* but that's about it. Back on 1F, surf to the upper right corner to enter Celestinine Mountain 1F.

Hidden on this map are a *Super Potion*, and a *Full Heal*. Cross the ice to the top right, and surf to the right and grab a hidden *Ultra Ball*. Note that the bottom of this map will lead you out to the cascade we saw earlier, so use this shortcut to heal if you like.

Anyways, without Dive and Waterfall there isn't much else to do in Celestinine Mountain 1F, so go up the ladder in the top right corner.

Cross the ice puzzle to get to the left. Precisely:

You'll eventually notice on the right the area connected to Route 2. Now we know how all three of these mountains are connected to each other and the greater Route 2 area! We're actually going to take a quick detour back to the circus while we're so close to it.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Blake at the bottom of the circus (+1 Blake)

There's also a Pokemon and a few items we can get right now using Surf, albeit in a bit of an odd way. You can get them later with Rock Climb super easily, but I'll cover it now. Head back to Route 2, and grab some rage powder. Enter Ametrine Mountain 2F, then make your way all the way backwards and exit out of Celestinine Mountain into the cascade. Go to the right and use the powder on the first Crustle you see.

Inside this cave you can get an *Elemental Seed* as well as the *Aerodactylite* and a hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. You can also talk to the rock at the top to battle **Salandit**!

Unfortunately this makes it impossible to go from Celestinine Cascade to the other side of Route 2 for now. If you want to reopen this shortcut, you'll need to head back through the mountain onto Route 2 to move another Crustle into that place.

Anyways, return to Ametrine 2F, surf to the left, and cross the simple ice puzzle. Talk to Aya near the iceberg. After this scene, follow the path up and right to emerge onto Route 3.

Time for another round with Aster and Eclipse! This time you'll have Aya as your partner, and thankfully her team actually puts in a decent amount of work in this fight, with lots of Water and Grass moves to deal with their numerous Water, Rock, and Ground type Pokemon. Aster and Eclipse like to set up screens against you with their leads, so you could consider bringing Brick Break or Psychic Fangs if these are annoying. Generally I find that Lunatone doesn't hit very hard, so if you are struggling with this one, you can continuously target the right side and get the battle to a 2-on-1 to make it simple.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Aya gets kidnapped (-2 Aya. This is not a choice, actually.)

After the fight, go to the left and grab *TM43 Flame Charge* in the storage room. Return to the previous room and head out from the door on the right side. In this next cave, you can get a hidden *Great Ball* and *Aspear Berry*. Head outside, pick up a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Magical Seed*, and *Blast Powder* then proceed to Route 4.

Throughout Route 4 you can find 2 hidden *Heart Scales*, *Super Potion*, 2 *PokeSnax*, *Purple Shard*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Red Shard*, 2 *Telluric Seeds*, *Grass Gem*, *X Attack*, and *Potion*. If you bring a Pokemon with Lava Plume, Heat Wave, Incinerate, Eruption, Fire Pledge, or Flame Burst, use it in battle. This will allow you to get the *Fire Memory* in the campfire at the center of the bottom half of the map.

Enter Calcenon City to the west.

## Calcenon City

Inside the Pokemon Center, a person will tell you about the password *noitems*. Another person in here will offer an in-game trade: your Qwilfish for **Munchlax**!

Enter the gym at the top of the city.

Talk to Hardy in the left side of the city for some points if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy and Fern on the left side of the city (+1 Fern)

Talk to Saphira here twice.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you would throw her to the dogs for the ring, while Saphira Points > 0 (+2 Charlotte, -1 Hardy, +1 Saphira)
- Tell Charlotte you would throw her to the dogs for the ring, while Saphira Points <= 0 (+2 Charlotte, -1 Hardy, -1 Saphira)
- Tell Charlotte you would not throw her to the dogs (-2 Charlotte, +1 Hardy)

Anyways, walk over to the Route 4 exit and talk to Charlotte inside. She'll tell us it's time for a gym battle, so head back into Calcenon.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Saphira and Sigmund on the west side of the city (-1 Sigmund)

## Cinder Badge

Enter Charlotte's gym when you are ready. The puzzle here is basically the same as Wallace's from generation 3: you have to carefully step on every gray tile exactly once and make it to the other side's stairs. For precise solutions:

Head up to where Charlotte is.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Open the secret room in Charlotte's gym while she is present (+1 Charlotte)

Technically you shouldn't know how to open the secret room by this point... So if you want to respect the fact accessing this room and getting this point is more of an easter egg for players on their second run, you can skip to the fight.

If you do want to open the secret room, you'll need to make the top area tiles look exactly like this:

Time for another of Reborn's double battle gym leaders. Her two leads, Darmanitan and Typhlosion, are incredibly fast and hit like trucks with their Fire moves. Eruption will turn the field to Burning Field, potentially making things more difficult. In the back she has a seeded Ninetales, who will amplify her Fire type moves even more thanks to Drought. With a bulky Rotom that can counter Water and Ground types and the speedy Heat Wave + coverage moves sets she has on her Delphox and Volcarona, Charlotte has a pretty frail but speedy and strong team that can overwhelm unprepared teams by their sheer field-boosted power.

Both the Super-Heated Field and Burning Field benefit Charlotte a lot, but they could benefit you as well. One hilarious strategy you can try is just using your own Fire types to obliterate her: use your own Eruption, Heat Wave, etc. As long as you can control for speed such as by using the Telluric Seed this tends to be reliable. If you find yourself stuck, Trick Room is an incredible strategy here - paired with Wide Guard, you can reliably set up Trick Room on the first turn with many different Pokemon. Under Trick Room, her entire team will crumple to slow Rock moves, Ground moves on top of Gravity, or Water moves if you can keep it on Burning to avoid the Super-Heated Field damage suppression. There are tons of other crafty doubles strategies you can use on this fight especially if you buy yourself some turns with Wide Guard, so get creative!

Once you win, you'll get the *Cinder Badge* which allows us to use Dive in the field and boosts the cap to Lv. 75. You'll also get *TM35 Flamethrower*! Very nice.

# Episode 14: //outlier.corruption

After your gym fight, enter the building in the bottom left side of Calcenon. You'll get *TMX6 Dive* inside! We could have gone in here earlier, but:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Charlotte before getting Dive (+1 Noel, +1 Shelly)

You can also talk to Hardy in here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in the Calcenon house about Charlotte (+1 Hardy)

With that, we now have all we need to Dive! There are a few quick things we can do, however!

## 11 Badge Quests

Enter the gate at the bottom of Calcenon. The guard inside will ask us to donate $40000 to repair the bridge that was broken in the previous chapter. Note that if you don't have enough cash, you'll need to go all the way through Route 4 and Route 3 caves to go between Ametrine Mountain and Calcenon City. Anyways, once you cough up the cash the bridge, will be fixed. Head outside and to the right on the stairs, and enter the cave here.

Inside, you can get an *Electrizer*, *Magmarizer*, and *Ghost Memory*. Re-enter Calcenon City. In the building to the right of the Pokemon Center you can trade this Magmarizer to get a **Magby**! In a building to the right of the gym you can trade the Electrizer for an **Elekid**!

Head down to Route 3 via the new stairs. Down from here, you'll see a ladder. Interact with it to create a quick shortcut that allows us to go from Calcenon to Agate Circus super easily! Head to the circus.

To the right of the high striker you'll see a new vendor. For three Green Shards you can do another puzzle! This is in fact a [Fifteen Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). When you finish, it will look like this:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/turtwig.jpg"/>

For winning you'll get a **Turtwig!**

Talk to the person in the top right guarding the Ferris Wheel to get the *Fighting Memory*.

## Mountain Range Divin'

Next, I will return to the Celestinine Cascade. If you've yet to put the Crustle we moved to get Salandit back in place, now is a great time to do so.

Enter Celestinine Mountain by surfing up at the cascade.

Go left up the stairs at your first opportunity, and make your way across the ice here such that you can surf at the bottom of this area. Go down at the dive spot here.

Hidden down here, you'll find a hidden *Resist Wing* and a *Red Shard*.

Emerge at the other dive spot. You can find a hidden *PokeSnax* as well as *TM82 Dragon Tail* and an *Exp. Candy XL*. Make your way back to the previous dive spot. Next, go up and right to head to Celestinine Mountain 2F and make your way to the large body of water. Dive down at the crescent-shaped spot.

To the right, you'll find the *Snowy Mountain Field Readout*. Up and to the right you'll find a *Water Stone*. Emerge at the dive spot in the upper right side. Up here you'll find the *PULSE Readout 2*. Oh dear.

Make your way back to the crescent dive spot. Head up to reach Ametrine Mountain 2F. Northeast of the iceberg, you'll find a dive spot.

Follow the path, diving up and down as you go. Once you pop up inside the iceberg, you'll find another PULSE!

With 255 in Def and SpD, a respectable HP stat, Leftovers and Recover, this thing is tanky! It also has a great attack stat and can hit hard with field boosted Avalanche as well as Hammer Arm and Earthquake for coverage. Earthquake also has the side effect of laying spikes on your side. There are a number of strategies that make this doable - it is a 6v1 after all, so it can't shake off stat debuffs. Toxic, Protect, and a healing move on a physically defensive Pokemon alone can pretty much win this fight. Heal Block, Knock Off, or Taunt can help with the recovery problem, Intimidate or other Atk debuffs can help neutralize its power, Counter or Metal Burst can ignore its high Def, etc.

With that out of the way, head up the now-open ladder up to Ametrine Mountain 3F. Up here you can get a hidden *Green Shard*, *X Attack*, and *Blue Shard*. On the next floor, you'll find a hidden *Ice Gem*. By going to the bottom left corner then alternating between going right and up/down, make your way to the door on the middle of the right side of the ice puzzle and exit.

Hidden here you'll find a *Purple Shard*, *Resist Wing*, *X Attack*, and *Ether* until you come upon the first fork. To the right along a narrow cliffside, you can find hidden *PokeSnax* and *Blue Shard*. Double back and go left. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Potion*, and *Zinc* as you proceed. Talk to Shelly here.

Enter the small building nearby. Inside, talk to the old man to begin a quest. You can also talk to his computer to get the *Glitch Field Readout*.

Head west at the next fork. You can get a hidden *Ether* around here. In the first house, you can bring a Rotom to the computer to change its form! Enter the tall building next. On the second floor, trade away your Pidove to a kid to get an *Old Amber*. Sweet. Head back outside and go to the left. You'll see a Lucario on a building, who will then run off. Follow it all the way right to the narrow cliffside, and it will run off with its egg.

Back at the main village fork, go down. In the south side of the city you can pick up hidden *Stardust*, *Big Pearl*, *Repel*, *Chewing Gum*, *Green Shard*, *Red Shard*, *X Sp. Atk*, *Full Heal*, *Tiny Mushroom*, and *Antidote*. Make sure you save this (or any) Tiny Mushroom for a quest later.

In the house next to the Pokemon Center, talk to the guy to learn of a glitch in his computer. Talk to the machine for a short battle gauntlet!

These battles aren't particularly tough, but it is our first real exposure to fighting on the glitch field, so try to get used to its quirks here. For winning, you'll obtain the *Department Store Sticker: Porygon-Z*.

Talk to the people around the ice rink to progress the story. Next, enter the building above the ice rink. You'll get the *Battle Pass - Gravity*. Can't use it quite yet though. Back outside, talk to Shelly. While we're here, navigate through the ice rink and the child obstacles to reach the exit at the bottom. Follow it to get *TM95 Snarl*.

From here, head up to the now-open apartment at the center of town. Go to the top floor and talk to Shelly.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to refuse Blake all three times.**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Give Blake the ring right away (+2 Blake, -2 Cal)
- Refuse Blake once, then give him the ring (+2 Blake, -2 Cal, -1 Shelly)
- Refuse Blake twice, then give him the ring (+2 Blake, -2 Cal, -1 Shelly, -1 Heather)
- Refuse Blake all three times. (Anna +1, Shade +1, Cal +2, -2 Shelly, -2 Blake, -1 Heather)

If you gave Blake the ring, you'll get *TMX5 Waterfall.* If you didn't, you'll need to head outside to talk to Cal, then come back in to Blake's apartment.

Now we have to search Blake's room for clues to make a way out.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Check under Blake's bed (-1 Blake)

Under the left couch you'll find *3 Coins*, while the chair towards the bottom contains *1 Coin* and the bottom right sofa contains *2 Coins*. In the trash can at the top you'll find the head of a key. The game console contains a Program Disc. The drawer at the bottom contains a key handle, so you can open the cabinet at the top to get a power cable. Use the cable and the disc on the computer to open a prompt for a password. To get the password, search all the books and flowers around the room and talk to Shelly a few times! Input the code once you have it:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    5083164
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the code</a>
</div>

Enter the secret passage and follow the path! On 6F you can find a hidden *Iron*.

Head outside and pick up the hidden *Flying Gem*. Talk to Shelly here. Once you have freed Heather, head into the shack and talk to the machine to get the *Flying Memory*!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Free Heather after refusing to give Blake the ring (+1 Heather)

Make your way back to the main part of Ametrine City and go all the way left. You'll have to defeat a few Meteor Grunts, with either Shelly or Cal as a partner depending on your choices.

It can sweep you if you're not prepared, but you can handle this surely. Once you win, head into the cave to get a *Fairy Memory* and an egg that will hatch into **Riolu**.

Head into the cave entrance back on the main path.

If and only if we didn't give Blake the ring, we will not yet have Waterfall, and will fight the following in this cave:

Aster is back, this time completely alone. He has a generally fast and frail physical team, so try to exploit the Icy Field or just overwhelm him with a better singles team.

Winning will finally net you *TMX5 Waterfall*.

### The Battle Atop Ametrine

Inside this cave you can get a hidden *PP Up* and an *Ultra Potion* upstairs.

Emerge into the outside once more, pick up the *Common Candy* and *Shoal Shell*, then prepare for a fight at the top.

Blake has a pretty tough doubles team that takes advantage of the power of Water and Ice types, but mainly from the physical side. Intimidate Gyarados is good as usual, and paired with Snow Cloak Mamoswine, it can crush your Pokemon that aren't as defensively blessed. In the back he has the speedy combo of Weavile, Starmie, and Slush Rush Sandslash, plus has a bulky Walrein with an extra 1.5x boost to defense thanks to natural hail. On top of that, the field boosts all of his Ice type attacks as well as Rock Slide, plus makes Thunder perfectly accurate. All in all this is a tough fight but not unbeatable!

There are lots of Snowy Mountain Field interactions you can exploit if you want. For example, you too can harness perfectly accurate Thunder to easily dispatch Gyarados and Starmie. This field may help out Ice types but arguably it can help Flying types even more: Flying attacks are boosted by 1.5x here and Tailwind grants Strong Winds, allowing your Flying types to ignore their Ice weaknesses and granting another 1.5x boost to flying moves! There are also a ton of boosted attacks and abilities on this field - a shoutout to Aurorus, who gets 1.5x for Refrigerate, AND 1.5x for Hyper Voice being boosted, AND 1.5x for Ice type moves being boosted on this field! You can also turn it to mountain with a burning move to cancel out the Ice type bonus on Rock type moves, too! Otherwise, I'll sound like a broken record here - it's a doubles fight, so you'll get mileage out of Wide Guard, Trick Room, Protect, and other similar strategies.

Once you win, Blake will fail!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- If Saphira was abducted earlier, Cal tells you about Terra and Lin in depth (+1 Terra)

Cal will offer you a ride back to the main part of Ametrine.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Refuse Cal's offer down the mountain (-1 Cal)

Before we leave Ametrine City, enter the small house just south of Blake's apartment and give the girl inside a Floral Charm in exchange for the *Banettite*! Next, head on over to the Pokemart. Inside, a person will give you a *Magmarizer*.

Before we proceed with the story, we can head over to Calcenon via the Route 3 shortcut to get the following points:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Cain in Calcenon after fighting Blake (+1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in Calcenon after fighting Blake (+1 Hardy)

You can also head into Charlotte's gym - if you decided to 'cheat' and open the secret door earlier, you can now follow the path to get the *Charizardite X*.

Enter the house to the left of the gym if you refused to give Blake the Ruby Ring. Exit and come back in. Inside the bedroom you can get the *Shiny Charm*! If not, you'll be able to get it later on.

With that out of the way, return to the Circus.

## Clown Indra Fights 2

By beating Charlotte, we now have access to stronger teams on Clown Indra. Beating him now awards a random shard as before, but also 5 *Exp. Candy XL*.

## Glitch City

Enter the Big Top and talk to Samson in the back. Terra will go into the computer... it's up to us to follow, so talk to Samson and go in.

Welcome to Glitch City. Note that as we clear parts of this area we will never be able to return, so make sure you do everything you want to do in each before proceeding.

Make your way through Kanto Route 23 as normal until Terra destroys the guy! Go down the ladder that appears here.

Bringing Mewtwo back to where it belongs with Glitch Field - completely broken. Of note is its Psystrike, which gets boosted by the field and Mewtwo's high Special Attack yet hits your Pokemon on their Defense. That said, there are still tons of ways to win these 6v1's as we've learned by now, so pick your favorite one.

Proceed and get ready for the gym battle! Note that you can actually exit back to the circus easily in case you want to do more prep.

Time to take on M3G4 T3RR4. As you've probably come to learn by now, the Glitch Field is pretty funky, enough that I'm gonna cover its intricacies with a whole diatribe before we even fight her. There are a few really important things about this field that you need to remember:

1. Type Matchups: all moves of the original physical types will be physical, and all moves of the original special types will be special, so we're back to certain Pokemon being snubbed and others strengthened depending on their movepools. Additionally, Dark, Steel, and Fairy moves will all be retyped as Normal, Dragon always hits neutrally, Bug and Poison hit each other super-effectively, Ice hits Fire neutrally, and Psychic is immune to Ghost. In some cases these changes can be good for you: such as how physical Fighting types now have a stronger option in physical Focus Blast, or how Bug and Poison types are generally better now.
2. Special attack damage: special attacks will be based on the higher stat of your SpA and SpD... an utter game changer, as now Special walls such as Shuckle and Toxapex are able to hit hard! It also means that raising Special Defense will increase both offensive and defensive capabilities - so moves like Cosmic Power, Charge, and Stockpile can lend themselves to creating a 1 Pokemon army if you set up at the right time.
3. Speedy crits: the faster Pokemon on the field always gets a bonus to critical hit chance, so with a Razor Claw held you're getting crits for free 50% of the time, and nearly always with moves like Night Slash! Helpful for ignoring those aforementioned defense boosts.
4. The Synthetic Seed turns a Pokemon into ??? type *with no weaknesses* and raises Defense. There are a few more things you can read about in the field notes like the Psychic move boost, but these are the main things you have to consider.

So, onto how Terra uses this field. You'll get a good example of the second principle right away in her Nidoking, who will get bulkier and *stronger* by using Amnesia. It can then hit hard with extra-accurate Blizzard, Thunderbolt and Flamethrower for wide special coverage. Hippowdon is bulky and likes to put you to sleep and hit with the ol' reliable Rock / Ground offensive combo, but more importantly, it sets up weather for its buddy Sand Rush Excadrill, who gets boosted critical hit rate as long as it's going first. If that wasn't enough she has a mixed Garchomp who gets to ignore the SpA drops of Draco Meteor by calculating special damage based on its SpD stat, but can also hit hard with physical Bulldoze and Stone Edge. Rounding out her team is Palossand and Quagsire, each with the Synthetic Seed, neutralizing their weaknesses entirely and allowing each to set up with Amnesia and Recovery moves. Quagsire even has Unaware to ruin whatever similar SpD stacking strategy you have going! All in all a tough team that may really mess you up if you aren't using the field to maximum effect for your team.

The first thing I recommend for this fight is to literally use a list like [this one](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VII)) to find some Pokemon with really high SpD, since they are generally the best for this field. Even better if they have moves like Amnesia, Stockpile, or Cosmic Power - you can use them to sweep once you get past Quagsire, especially if you decide to give them a Synthetic Seed of their own to avoid super-effective damage taken. Ice, Water, Grass, and Psychic moves are generally the best choices offensively here - in particular, 90% accurate Blizzard and hits-defense Psyshock are good choices. It's worth noting that Explosion halves enemy defense, which makes it useful as a last-minute nuke against the ??? type tanks or Garchomp. If have a Pokemon with high speed and a move like Leaf Blade, you can also try to go for 100% critical hit chance, which should allow you a much easier time with the members of her team who stack SpD. You can also consider using Roar, Whirlwind, or Dragon Tail on the ??? type Pokemon, since that will wipe away their special typing and defense boost, allowing you to use Grass moves more easily on them.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Terra (-4 Terra, actually not a choice)

For winning, you'll get the *Gravity Badge* which lets us actually use Waterfall. We also get *TM78 Bulldoze*! We did it.
# Episode 15: Never After

Head back outside. Before we proceed with the story, there's some more mountain action we can do. We've actually only seen like 30% of the massive three-mountain complex; much more of it is now accessible thanks to Waterfall. So, I will cover that in the next section.

## Mountain Range Waterfallin'

Enter Ametrine Mountain 2F via the Route 3 entrance. Surf and climb the nearby waterfall. Upstairs on 3F, you can get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Never-Melt Ice*. Across the ice you can find a hidden *Potion*. On the ice puzzle to the left, creep along the tiles above the ice, then go down onto a rock, left, and up. Grab a hidden *Super Potion*. Head up the waterfall to 4F.

At the top you can grab a hidden *Escape Rope*. Sadly we can't proceed on this route without Rock Climb, so hop down the ledge and make your way down two flights to 2F.

From here, make your way to the waterfall down and left from the Route 2 entrance, then ride down it to Ametrine Mountain 1F. To the right, you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Escape Rope*, and *Exp. Candy L*. By smashing its favorite rock, you can catch a **Sneasel**.

Surf down the waterfall to the left, then pick up a hidden *Full Heal* on the right. Land on the left side and make your way across the ice. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and push the boulder to the left. Head back up the waterfall, go left, pick up hidden *Paralyze Heal* and *Purple Shard*, then go down at the dive spot.

You'll find a hidden *Blue Shard* in the first room. Notice that there's a hard-to-spot door on the right side of the area - it's a lit alcove you enter from above. These signify going down in level within the mountain (you can check the level you're on by initiating a save from the menu). Inside it, you can find a hidden *Antidote* and *Red Shard*. Surface at the end of the path, and you'll emerge into Ametrine Mountain B1F.

Grab a hidden *Full Heal* and *Health Wing* then proceed to the ice. Make your way to the top right corner of this area, and surf down. Grab a hidden *Water Gem* and climb down the fall to B2F.

In this next room, go left across the ice. Pick up a hidden *Green Shard* and *Pretty Wing*, then climb the waterfalls to the left. In the pool at the top, you can find **Totodile** jumping around. Talk to it while it's in the air for a battle.

Back at the ice puzzle in the room, go up this time. Grab hidden *Stardust* and cross this ice. Before going down the dive spot, go down the fall to get a hidden *Full Restore*. Dive down up above. Grab a hidden *X Sp. Def* on this map and enter the hidden alcove door towards the bottom. In the next room you can get a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Dark Gem*. Surface at the other end and emerge on B3F.

You can get a hidden *Pearl* and *Red Shard* in the next room, as well as *TM01 Work Up* and a *Razor Fang*. Backtrack all the way back to B1F.

This time, cross the ice to the top left. Grab the hidden *Poke Ball* then dive down. Hidden in here are a *Green Shard*, *Genius Wing*, and *Red Shard*. We can also get a *Deep Sea Tooth*. Enter the alcove door at the bottom.

In this large room you can get an *Exp. Candy XL* and the *Snorlium-Z* as well as a hidden *Green Shard*, *Water Stone*, and *Super Potion*. Also, specifically on Friday, you can find a **Lapras** roaming around this room!

Enter the hidden alcove door in the lower left side. In the next room you can find a hidden *Green Shard* and *Link Stone*, as well as the *Abomasite*!

With that, backtrack all the way to Ametrine Mountain 1F where we pushed the boulder earlier - using an Escape Rope or Dig may be faster here. In any case, make your way back to the water and ride down some waterfalls until you reach Celestinine Mountain 1F.

From here, go down the waterfall in the bottom right to reach B1F. At the split, go up and grab the hidden *Repel* then dive down.

Underwater, pick up a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Exp. Candy XL*, *Iron*, and *Clever Wing*. Surface in the bottom left corner and cross the ice to get *TM47 Low Sweep*, then backtrack to the B1F fork.

Go down this time. Pick up a hidden *PP Up* by going up and left, then surf down the waterfall at the bottom. In the right corner you can get a *Potion*, but unfortunately that's all we can do here without Rock Climb.

Backtrack to Celestinine Mountain 1F, then go up the ladder in the upper right side to return to 2F. Follow the path left and  dive down at the crescent shaped spot and surface at the spot in the upper right side. Climb the waterfall here to reach 3F.

On this floor, you'll need to push boulders into the dead ends in order to skate around the entire area. Make sure you're not pushing them into the path - always choose the dead end, and you'll figure this one out. You'll find a hidden *Aspear Berry* within, and a *Exp. Candy L* and hidden *Nugget* in the top left corner. Climb the waterfall to 4F.

We can fish up an ugly fish on this floor! This room contains a hidden *Flying Gem* and *Green Shard* as well as *TM03 Psyshock*, a *Dragon Scale*, *Timid Mint*, *Water Memory*, and *Exp. Candy XL*.

Backtrack all the way to Celestinine 1F. Go left across the ice to enter Citrine Mountain 1F. Surf straight down, ride down the small waterfall, and pick up a hidden *Green Shard*, *Shoal Salt*, and *PokeSnax*. Push the nearby boulder to the left, then go up the waterfall and cross the now open ice patch.

With the Silver Ring in hand, we can catch Corey's **Skuntank** here! Behind it, pick up the *Silver Card*.

Make your way to Citrine Mountain 2F by climbing the ladder in the top left corner, and climb the waterfall. Pick up the *Prism Scale* and hidden *Common Candy*. Climb the waterfall at the top to reach 3F. Here, you'll find 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, *Amplifield Rock*, *Grass Memory*, *TM74 Gyro Ball*, hidden *Super Repel*, *Great Ball*, *Guard Spec.* and *Shoal Salt*. Oh, and you can get Corey's **Mareanie** here!

That wraps up our massive collection effort in the mountain complex. Return to Celestinine Cascade and head down the waterfall when you're ready.

## Water Treatment Center

Talk to Titania here, then enter the North Obsidia Water Grid at the bottom.

In this area, we can hop across piles of trash if they're 2 spaces away. Make your way to the machine to the left - this is a water level machine. Pressing it will lower the water, letting us move trash around and progress. For now, lower the water and make your way to the right. In the very bottom right corner, in the mud behind a girder, you'll find the *Murkwater Surface Field Readout* hidden behind a pillar. Go up and right to enter the Central Obsidia Water Grid.

Talk to Titania then hop down. If you go left, you can use a panel to open a shortcut.

Talk to Titania a few times in the center if you want.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Give Titania some candy when she says she is hungry (+1 Titania)

Lower the water level, then head down into the mud at the top. Push each of the trash to the right such that you'll be able to hop across them into the upper right area once the water level rises again. Importantly, keep in mind that when the water level rises, the trash will end up one tile higher than they appear to be on when the water level is lowered. Here, the solution is just to push them each right four tiles. Raise the water level when you're done and hop across. Use a panel to make a shortcut and enter the Onyx Water Grid on the right.

In this next room, Titania will be stranded on an island and the water level will be lowered. Push the trash into a position such that Titania will be able to jump across it to the right, then make your way up and to the right.

Raise the water, watch Titania move into a new spot, then lower the water and move the trash to help her go down. Raise the water. Once Titania opens the way, lower the water and go down and left to cross back into the Central Obsidia Water Grid.

Open the gate here. Lower the water level at the center and return to the bottom right corner, going down the stairs and following the path. Push the garbage into place so you can hop across, then raise the water and hop across. Use the panel up here, then lower the water level once more, then enter the door at the bottom left side to enter the Opal Water Grid.

Proceed to the left to enter the Peridot Water Grid. Use the panel here, then lower the water level to the left. Return to Opal Water Grid, go up into the North Obsidia Water Grid, and lower the water level if it is not down already. Move the two piles of trash from their current locations to the left side of the machine so that you can hop to the door at the left. Raise the water level and enter the Peridot Water Grid at this entrance.

Exit out of the door at the top right. Enter the next door and go up to get a *Hyper Potion*. Go back down and left into the Peridot Water Grid. You'll be able to hop across some trash here to get a *Quick Ball* and the *PULSE Readout 3*. You can also talk to the shutter here to open a door at the top of this room.

Enter this new room in the top right corner, and grab a hidden *Cell Battery*. In the top right is an *Electirizer*. Exit and re-enter, and now there will be an Electrode in the corner. Battle it and transform the Short-Circuit Field into Factory Field. Talk to the nearby machine to get **Fennekin**!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Read the note that comes with Fennekin (+1 Ace)

Return to the previous room. Enter the Lapis Water Grid via the door to the left, then head up the left side.

PULSE Swalot is slow but extremely bulky, and also has not 1, not 2, but 3 separate ways to heal - Recover, Black Sludge, and healing via its ability on the field. It also is Poison type, so you can't use Toxic and wait like you could with Avalugg. It also hits respectably hard, and thanks to Discharge paralysis and Infestation flat damage, so you're likely going to have a hard time trying to get your own tank set up against it.

I recommend trying to neutralize its healing - Knock Off or Trick with a Sticky Barb, Gastro Acid or Entrainment, Heal Block or Taunt are all options that can successfully prevent it from getting HP back. Then, you can exploit the fact that Electric moves are boosted on this field to finally knock it out!

Once you win, the Water Treatment Center's purification mechanisms will get fixed, but we'll need to make the water level in every single room rise to make it clean again. To start, raise the water level nearby! You'll see the room change to blue on the nearby map.

Note that the normal water can be surfed on! Head east into the Central Obsidia Grid and fix the water level in here. Note you can surf to the right now to get *TM67 Smart Strike*.

Enter the Coral Water Grid in the bottom right. Fix the water, then enter the Onyx Grid at the top. Fix the water in here, then surf to the top of the room to get *TM93 Wild Charge*. Walk all the way back to the North Obsidia Grid.

Fix the water here, head left into the Peridot Water Grid, and raise the water level once more. Head up into the Lapis Grid and fix the water. Fix the Jasper Grid's water, grab the *Scope Lens*, and finally return to the Beryl grid. Talk to Titania in the upper right corner. Surf to the top left corner of the room and proceed through all the barriers, then free Titania below. Use the Light Shard and go in.

You'll have a decision to make.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to NOT battle Taka.**

All of the other choices we've made so far actually pale in comparison to the butterfly effect that comes following this choice. For reasons that will become clearer later on, the results of choosing to fight Taka are called the *Zekrom Route* and the results of choosing to not fight Taka are called the *Reshiram Route* by the community. This guide will also use these conventions.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fight Taka (+2 Taka, +1 Ace, -1 Titania)
- Don't Fight Taka (+1 Anna, +1 Shade, -1 Ace, -2 Taka)

If you chose to fight Taka and enter the Zekrom Route:

Time for another fight with Taka, but he doesn't have a particularly tough team this time. If you have something to deal with his lead, an Ice type or two can basically steamroll his team.

Regardless of your route you'll have to fight Ace.

Time for another fight with Ace. This time they use a field that's fairly well designed for the Factory and Short-Circuit fields, thanks to multiple Steel and Electric moves. They also have Roserade, Zoroark, and Delphox to complete the well rounded squad. Flying and Ground moves together hit 5/6 of their Pokemon super-effectively, so if you can manage speed and exploit these weaknesses, you will likely find a way to succeed.

After this fight, return to the front of the Water Treatment Center and climb the waterfall.

## Fiore Mansion Gauntlet

Make your way towards the Fiore Mansion, and you'll meet up with some old characters and obtain *TMX2 Fly*! About time. Heal and prepare your team and then head in... we have a huge Gauntlet coming up! Thankfully, this one will heal us between each fight.

This battle in the gauntlet is a bit harder. Florinia has a lot of good matchups damage-wise against Fern and Blake, you just have to make sure she's able to attack them before they take her out. Since Florinia's team is so slow, I really recommend using Trick Room in this fight. If you can ensure Scizor and Weavile get knocked out, you won't have to worry about priority, so you can generally overrun their teams with strong super-effective moves. You might also want to consider screens to keep your side safe from OHKOs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Florinia joins your team after you did not defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Florinia)
- Julia joins your team after you did defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Julia, -1 Fern)

The hardest battle in this gauntlet is the last one. On one hand, Solaris' team basically consists of six classic OU threats. On the other hand, John's team consists of some slower and less powerful Pokemon, but which have wider coverage, a bit higher defensive stats, and some support moves. Nothing on their side is entirely dead weight really, and since you only get to control the actions of one of two of the Pokemon on your side, it is tougher to use doubles strats to gain momentum.

If you defeated Solaris on Pyrous, you'll have Julia as a partner, who sadly doesn't have a very good time overall against the pair thanks to their numerous Ground and Electric types, though she can help against some of the Flying types. Not to mention her Rotom Fan, who holds an Air Balloon... Otherwise, you'll have Florinia as a partner once more, making Trick Room more potent and allowing her to do a decent amount of the work. With the 12v12 format, things can change dramatically depending on what the pairings happen to be at any given moment, so it may require some luck to have the right one of your partner's Pokemon out at the right time. If you have to quit to change up your team, you'll have to fight the first two trainers again, so keep that in mind.

After these events finish playing out, head outside of the building and talk to Titania. Return to the circus!

## Suspension Badge

Talk to Samson. You'll be given the *Battle Pass - Suspension*. Sweet. Save, then talk to Ciel when you're ready for another gym battle!

Ciel is the first fight for a badge that repeats a field used by another, but the fight plays out very differently. Many of the strategies I recommended to beat Samson are employed by Ciel against you in this fight. The emphasis is no longer on High Striker moves - Altaria, Minior, and Gliscor have Earthquake, and that's it. Instead, she relies on super-boosted Acrobatics, Revelation Dance, and sound-based moves that dazzle the crowd and gain power. Oh, and she has the first enemy Mega Pokemon we have to face in Mega Altaria.

Similarly to Samson, you can win by just exploiting this field's many effects. Just as I recommended using Acrobatics and Revelation Dance against Samson, it could be really funny to use your own High Strikin' Pokemon with Smack Down and Earthquake, since her team past Gliscor doesn't have a ton of defense. Nothing on her team resists Acrobatics, so you can beat her with her own strategy. Electric type Revelation Dance can rip through all but Gliscor and Altaria pretty easily if you have an Oricorio yourself. You can also just use Trick Room and a couple slower Ice and Rock types to bowl over her team.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Ciel on your first try (+2 Samson)
- Defeat Ciel on your second, third, etc. try (-1 Samson)

For winning, you'll get the Suspension Badge, boosting our cap to a whopping Lv. 80! You'll also get *TM62 Acrobatics*. Useful. Most importantly though, we can now Fly, meaning we can once more return to Reborn City.

# Episode 16: A City, Reborn

Head outside the big top. Before we fly back to Reborn City and other previously inaccessible areas, we can snag a new more points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy on Route 4 (+1 Hardy)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Cain in Calcenon City (+1 Cain)

## Tanzan Cove Water Exploration

So, we now have access to a ton of areas we've previously visited, plus we can now use Surf, Waterfall, and Dive. Despite what seems like an odd choice of initial destination, head first to Tanzan Cove via flying to the Belrose Manse.

Dive underwater in the Tanzan Cove.

Down here you'll find a *Metronome*, *Big Nugget*, and the *Flower Garden Field Readout* as well as hidden *Escape Rope*, *Potion*, *Repel*, *Awakening*, *Grass Gem*, *Burn Heal*, *Red Shard*, *Chesto Berry*, *X Sp. Atk*, and *Great Ball*. Talk to the bodies of the Meteor grunts down here to get a *Spooky Plate*, and *Hyper Potion*. In particular, make sure you talk to the body with the missing ID tag on the left side of the area.

Return to the surface and talk to the fisherman on the right side of the map. If you've done all the steps of Simon's quest so far, you'll be given the *Super Rod*! I brought us here first so I could list surfing and super rod encounters at the same time :\)

To continue Simon's quest, we'll need to donate 3 locally-caught Whiscash to this guy. Do so, and you'll get the *ID Tag*. We'll finish this quest a bit later.

For now, surf onto the lake, and head towards the left side of the map. You'll find a hidden *Elemental Seed* on the southern point of the landmass here. Land in the center, grab the hidden *Calcium*, then go into the cave.

## Neo Opal Ward

Ok, with that out of the way, we can finally begin to explore Neo Reborn City - The entire city actually was renovated while we were away. Neat. Go ahead and fly to "Neo" Opal Ward.

If you want to blitz through the story, you can talk to Ame in the Grand Hall and tell her you're waiting for her, but there are tons of nice things we can get before we talk to her.

There are a ton of sidequests and main quests that will take us all over the city and to other areas. For now, I will take us through every neo-ward one-by-one to cover everything we can get right now. The streets are now crackless and transportation more seamless due to Fly, so movement around the city is easier.

First, head up into the park to the right of the Pokemon Center to talk to Elder Seacrest. He will give us a quest: collect the four types of Mulch scattered about the city. Use your Itemfinder all around the lower part of the ward to get an *Ultra Potion*, *Super Repel*, *X Defend*, *Blue Shard*, *Eject Button*, as well as the *Damp Mulch*, which is in the park around where we once got Whismur and Gulpin. Head into the Lower Peridot Alleyway.

Follow this path through to South Obsidia Ward to get a *White Flute*. Return to Peridot.

Heading to the upper side of the ward, we can get a hidden *Ice Heal*, *Carbos*, *Guard Spec.*, *Escape Rope*, *Poke Ball*, *Purple Shard*, *Nugget*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, and *Blast Powder*.

In the plot of the former Mosswater Factory there is now a market.

Head up and enter the house where we once got Igglybuff. If you return it to her, you'll get a *Luck Incense* and a *Pixie Plate*.

Outside her house and down, there is an orange tent. Hidden underneath this tent is an NPC who will give you the *Expert Belt*. I have played this game many times and only recently learned about this.

Enter the building that Simon is in, to the east of the Industrial Factory, and show him the ID Tag we found inside of Whiscash. You'll be rewarded with *TM06 Toxic* for finishing Simon's quest.

Enter the former Blacksteam Factory. Inside, you'll find an NPC who'll give you the password *penniless*. In the room that once contained Muk, you can talk to a guy who will bet you $1000 increments for coin flips. If you beat him a few times, he'll run out of money but trade you *TM27 Return* for all the money you collected so far. You can put a Pokemon with Super Luck at the front of your party to always win, or simply save in front of him before you bet.

Enter the North Peridot Alleyway outside.

Later on, we'll need a Male Lurantis and a Female Lurantis for a quest, so it might be a good opportunity to get those now.

You'll find a *Balm Mushroom*, 5 *Exp. Candy L*, and a hidden *Synthetic Seed*. Make sure you don't sell the former. The abandoned gym has been replaced with soft soil to grow berries in. To start, you can get *4 Enigma Berries*, *4 Starf Berries*, *2 Aguav Berries*, *2 Mago Berries*, *2 Micle Berries*, *2 Iapapa Berries*, *2 Figy Berries*, a *Leppa Berry*, and a *Wiki Berry*.

On the south side of the Forest Park, you'll also find another guy who looks like Corin Rouge!

You'll notice that there are a ton of invisible obstacles all over Beryl and the surrounding areas, but we can't do anything about them right now. Still, we can maneuver around many of them to get some goodies.

Hidden in Beryl you can get a *Poison Gem*, *Blue Shard*, *Magical Seed*, *Red Shard*, and the *Gooey Mulch* in the central park.

Before we leave, there are a few more things to do in Beryl. Enter the library and pick up the *Library Application* at the desk. This is the first of many applications we can grab to help us complete a sidequest later on. Upstairs you'll learn about the *monowoke* password. At the southwest corner of town, there is a shop run by the Inspector guy.

Enter the Spyce restaurant on the right. At the counter you can grab a *Spyce Application*. Once the chef pops out of the kitchen, talk to him to begin the chef's quest. He'll ask us to bring the following items: Honey, Tiny Mushroom, Balm Mushroom, Slowpoke Tail, White Herb, Stick, Sweet Heart, Moomoo Milk, Energy Root, Custap Berry, Whipped Dream, and Shoal Salt. A few of these we don't yet have.

Hidden around this part of the ward are an *HP Up*, *Pop Rocks*, *Green Shard*, *Elemental Seed*, as well as the *Growth Mulch* in the park on the bottom right side.

Notice that means we have now found all four of the mulches, so talk to Seacrest in Lower Peridot to get the *Venusaurite* and an *Insect Plate*. The nearby assistant will give you the *Decidium-Z*.

Back in Obsidia, there are tons of shops we can access. Enter the Sweet Co. HQ in the former Yureyu building. Talk to someone behind the desk to get a *Sweet Application*.

Enter the building to the right on Saffron Street. After seeing a conversation, talk to the girl to learn about the invisible obstacles in Beryl. We can't do anything about it yet though. The person at the top will give us the *Silph Application*.

In the building to the right you can get a *Medicine Application*.

Inside the Cafe Salon, you can pick up a *Salon Application*.

Enter the Critical Capture building. You can pick up a *Critical Application*. There is also a new clerk here.

This is a 6v2 fight that might kick your butt simply because Underwater Field allows these two to outspeed nearly every Pokemon you have and either hit hard with field boosted moves or set up with Shell Smash / Double Team. If you can control the speed somehow or have something bulky enough to hit back, you can find a way through this one.

Once you win, you'll get **Popplio**! Beyond, you'll find *TM68 Giga Impact* and a hidden *King's Rock*. There's also a slightly different encounter table here.

Enter the Onyx Trainer School and go all the way to the left. Talk to the girl here to get a *Sweet Heart*. On the second floor, enter the open double doors then go up the stairs to the third floor. Talk to the girl on the left. Return to the first girl and you'll get a *Incinium-Z*!

By now, we should be able to give all the ingredients to the Spyce. Once you do, you'll get 2 *Leftovers*!

## Neo Spinel Town & Chrysolia Spring

That wraps up things in the city limits for right now, so fly over to Spinel Town. Enter the museum.

Towards the top of the ground floor you'll see a new entrance to a gift shop.

Surf across and push the first boulder out of the way and grab a hidden *Common Candy*. Towards the top, you'll need to push a boulder onto a nearby water stream, when you do so, it will make the other one larger. Surf onto that larger jet to be pushed up on a ledge! Grab the hidden *Red Shard* and *X Defend* then push the boulder into the hole. Grab the *Red Card* then jump down.

Head up and grab the *Exp. Candy XL*. Next, go all the way down and take the large jet back to the first floor. Grab the hidden *Psychic Gem* then head back to B1F.

Essentially, this single boulder in the center can solve four different puzzles, each in a different corner of this room.

I will start with the top left direction. For this direction, you'll essentially need to push this boulder onto the nearby water stream... but despite being only 2 tiles away, we will need to push it the long way all the way around the lake here.

The boulder's path should look like the following, just note that you'll need to surf to reach certain positions to continue its progress. You can push it while it's on land and you're on the water.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_b1nw.png"/>

This area contains a hidden *Elixir*, *Green Shard*, and *Rock Gem*. Once you successfully push the boulder into the final spot, step onto the tall water jet to return to 1F.

You can get a hidden *Water Gem* here. Push the boulder in the top right corner onto the jet in the bottom left corner, then hop up the ledge and enter the cave.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_1fnw.png"/>

Inside the sauna, if you want, you can blow away the steam with a wind-based move, but it's not necessary other than for visibility. You can get an *Exp. Candy XL*, *Timid Mint*, and the *Cameruptite* in here.

Make your way back to B1F. This time, push the boulder in the bottom left direction. Push it onto the jet in the bottom left, then go up the stream to the bottom right side. Grab the hidden *Super Potion* and move the nearby boulder onto the jet in the bottom right. Go up the tall jet to 1F.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_b1sw.png"/>

In this portion you can find a hidden *Blue Shard*. Push this boulder onto the jet in the bottom left corner, then hop up the jet. Jump down the hole.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_1fsw.png"/>

Get the hidden *Red Shard*, then go into the nearby sauna. Grab the *Modest Mint* and hidden *Elixir*. There are three jets in this room - the bottom one is inaccessible by boulders. Push the two boulders onto the other two, then go up the tall jet. Grab the *Exp. Candy XL* and *TM50 Overheat* here.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_b2sw.png"/>

Return to B1F, this time pushing the boulder in the top right direction. Grab the hidden *Water Gem* here. You'll need to temporarily push the boulder up, surf across, and move another boulder out of the way in order to push the boulder down and onto the jet.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_b1ne.png"/>

On 1F, grab the hidden *Dusk Ball*. Essentially 5 of these boulders are duds (in blue), and you'll need to get them out of the way of the single boulder (in green) that you can move onto the jet. Of the bottom right pair, it is the left one. Once you get it into place go up the jet and follow the path to the sauna.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_1fne.png"/>

In here, you can get a *Jolly Mint*, *Red Flute*, *Big Nugget*, and *Exp. Candy XL*.

Make your way back to B1F, and finally push the boulder in the bottom right direction. You'll find a hidden *Big Pearl* and *Flame Plate* in this area. This puzzle should be straightforward by now, just note that you'll need to at some point surf across the rightmost pond and push the second boulder right to clear the path - see the yellow line. Use the big jet to reach 1F.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_b1se.png"/>

Up here, you can get a hidden *Awakening*. To finish this puzzle, you'll need to push the boulder counter-clockwise around this area to reach the jet. Follow the path to the final sauna.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_1fse.png"/>

This room has a lot of ledges, and is a bit chaotic. You'll find an *Exp. Candy XL*, *Adamant Mint*, *TM61 Will-o-Wisp*, as well as a hidden *Fire Gem*.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/spring_b2se.png"/>

Exit the Chrysolia Spring once you're done.

Climb the waterfall at the top of the area, grab the hidden *Nugget*, and follow the path to get a *Dark Material*. Next, surf your way all the way down the river in the valley. Use the green crystal beneath the waterfall to get *TM89 U-Turn*.

Exit the valley and return to Route 1. Grab a Tauros and head into the top right North Aventurine Woods entrance.

At the top, you can surf across to get the *Sharpedonite*!

Make your way all the way to the left to the entrance of North Aventurine Woods that leads to Celestinine Mountain 2F. Across the ice and in the bottom left corner we can now surf on this body of water. You'll find a *Shoal Shell* and hidden *Revive* directly across. Dive down to the right.

Down here, you'll find a hidden *Steel Gem*, 2 *Blue Shards*, *Ether*, and *Rare Candy*. You'll also find 5 *Exp. Candy XL* at the top. Towards the right, there is a door to a deeper cavern, surface to get a *Deep Sea Scale* and a *Big Nugget*.

That's it for this area right now!

## Neo Apophyll Beach

Fly over to the Apophyll Academy and enter the academy. Talk to the girl in the first room to get the *Apophyll Application*. In the academy's center area you can find a hidden *Purple Shard*.

Head down into the meditation spot where we once met Kiki.

In the map surrounding the academy, you'll be able to find 3 hidden *Shoal Shells* and a *Protein*, as well as hidden *Shoal Shell* and *Health Wing* above the academy.

Head to the Apophyll Beach to the right side of the academy. On this map you'll be able to find a hidden *Calcium* and 5 *Shoal Shells*. Making our way to the map on the left side of the academy, we can get a hidden *Ultra Potion*, *Star Piece*, and *Rock Gem*.

Next, make your way all the way to the top of Pyrous Mountain. From the bottom of the lava crater we can actually fish...!

## Azurine Lake

Next it's time to cover the actual Azurine Lake! There are tons of things we can do in this gargantuan area. To start, surf up from the Apophyll Academy, and enter the cave in the rock formation (1).

Fight the swimmer if you'd like. You'll see a narrow strip of sand, on which you can land on at the top. You can get a hidden *Shoal Shell* and *Ultra Ball* as well as a *Sun Stone* here. Dive down here to explore the Fairview Apartments area (2).

My automated map screenshot tool hates seaweed tiles for some reason, so apologies for the blank tiles on the underwater maps.

Hidden in this part of the large underwater area, you can find a *Shoal Shell*, *Awakening*, and *Purple Shard*. You'll notice that the buildings around here are numbered, and many of them are locked, but some are not. We won't be able to ever open some of them - I will note the locations of the ones we will so that they are easier to find later. Starting from the bottom, we will explore the open doors.

On the right side you can enter a house (marked 3) containing a *Relic Silver* as well as a hidden *Salt-Water Taffy* and the *F14 Key*. To the left and slightly up you'll find another unlocked building (4) containing 5 *Exp. Candy XL* as well as a hidden *Blue Shard*.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_553_1.png"/>

Up from here, you can find hidden *Blue Shard*, *Ultra Potion*, and *Poke Ball*. On the left is Fairview 14, which we now have the key to! Inside, you can get a *Relic Gold* as well as the hidden *S9 Key*. Up from here you'll find an open house (5) containing a *Relic Copper* and the *F34 Key* hidden.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_567_2.png"/>

Surface somewhere in the upper part of the underwater map. You can find a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and 2 *Shoal Shells*.

Make your way to the very bottom of the underwater area and use your new key on Fairview 34. Inside you can get a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Water Gem* and the *F1 Key*. Make your way all the way to the top of the underwater area now and use the key to get a *Blue Flute*.

That wraps up this section of the lake for now. Fly over to Coral Ward and surf west.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_536_1.png"/>

Once you see sand, you can get a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Hyper Potion* as well as a *Fist Plate*.

From here, go southwest, but not too far. You'll notice a 2-by-2 dive spot between some rocks (6). Dive down here to access the Faeward Apartment area. You can get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Big Pearl* down here.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_556_1.png"/>

Inside the top house (7) you can get a *Relic Vase*, 2 *Exp. Candy XL*, and the *Primarium-Z*. Hidden here also are a *Purple Shard* and an *Ultra Potion*. Returning to the surface in the main part of the underwater section will lead you to a hidden *Weakness Policy* on the island (8).

Return to the spot with the swimmer, then make your way west towards Apophyll (to the south is Azurine Island, which I'll cover later on).

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_567_3.png"/>

Hopefully the layout of the Azurine Lake is starting to make a bit more sense - Peridot Ward is the northern edge, Apophyll Beach is in the southwest, Azurine Island is on the south side, and Coral Ward is the southeast edge.

Once you hit a wall, a little bit down you'll see another strip of sand (9) that you can land on. Grab the hidden *Carbos* here and surf down and left. Before diving down, go to the left onto another sandy island (10) to get a hidden *X Speed* and *Elixir*. At the top left corner is another 2-by-2 dive spot, so go down here to get a hidden *Super Repel* and *TM16 Light Screen*.

Now, return to the larger dive spot we previously skipped to reach the Sunrise Apartments area. Hidden on the underwater map you'll find a *Green Shard*, *Blue Shard*, *Big Pearl*, and *Purple Shard*.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_553_2.png"/>

The building in the bottom right side (11) is unlocked, and you'll find a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Green Shard* and the *S12 Key*. There is another unlocked house at the top (12) containing a *Relic Silver*, and a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and the *K33 Key*.

Surface towards the top of the underwater area and go up and left to reach an island. Grab the *Water Stone* and hidden *Shoal Shell* it contains then surf up and to the right. You can get a hidden *Red Card* in the bottom right corner. Dive down here.

On this map you can get a hidden *Green Shard*, *X Speed*, and *Red Shard*. We can unlock the S12 house all the way to the right to get a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Green Shard* and the *S4 Key*. A nearby building (13) is unlocked and contains a *Heart Scale* and hidden *Ice Heal*. Unlock the S9 building to the left to get the *Glalitite* and a hidden *Purple Shard*. You can unlock S4 in the bottom left to get *TM98 Power-Up-Punch* and a hidden *Escape Rope*.

That's it for the Sunrise apartments. Fly to the Peridot Ward. East of the shelter (former site of PULSE Muk), you'll be able to surf south.

You'll be spit out right next to Apophyll Cave. Notice that there is a small path (14) you can surf through to go up from here, so take it.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_522_2.png"/>

At the very top you can get a *King's Rock*. Head down, following the right wall of rocks until you are able to pass through an opening (15). Surf to the various islands around the outside here to find a hidden *Sky Plate* and *Ether*. 

Head down (past the dotted green line). You can also get a hidden *Red Shard* and *X Sp. Atk* on the large central island.

Dive down here into the Kingsbury Apartments area, and go all the way up.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_574_1.png"/>

In the top left corner, a building is unlocked (16) and contains a *Glitter Ball*, which is a custom ball that either has a high catch rate on shiny Pokemon or has a normal catch rate but *turns the Pokemon it catches shiny*. Very cool. Head down from here onto technically a new map.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/azurine_558_1.png"/>

On this map, you'll find a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Ether*, *Awakening*, and *Poke Ball*.

In the top right corner, enter an unlocked building (17) to get the *Splash Plate* as well as hidden *Salt-Water Taffy* and a *Blue Shard*. Down and right from here you'll reach a large unlocked building (18) containing a *Relic Silver* as well as hidden *Red-Hots*, *Pokesnax*, and the *K22 Key*. We can unlock the K33 building to the left from here to get a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Common Candy*. In this building you can also talk to the upper left cabinet and use an antidote to get a **Mudkip**!

Enter the building to the left (19) to get a hidden *Blue Shard*, *Purple Shard* and the *K5 Key*. Left and up from here you can enter the K22 building to get a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Blue Shard* and the *K2 Key*. Head all the way up in the underwater section and enter K2 to get the hidden *F10 Key*. Around to the right you can enter K5 and get a *Max Revive*. Nice.

Make your way all the way to the bottom left corner of the large underwater area. Enter the unlocked house at the bottom (20) to get a *Relic Copper*. Hidden here is a *Purple Shard* and the *Diamond Ring*, an item we will use for a sidequest in a few subsections. Back outside, surface in this corner of the underwater map. On the left you'll notice a 2-by-2 dive spot (21) that will lead you to the *Altarianite*.

Next, in the middle of the main underwater section, on the left side of the loop you'll notice a bright 2-by-2 spot (22). Surface here specifically and surf around to the other side, grabbing the hidden *Level Ball*. Enter this cave.

An annoying set that might ruin your team if you're unprepared! Taunt and Toxic completely shut it down, however. You can also take the cave ceiling down!

Beyond, you'll get *TM59 Brutal Swing*. Head up the waterfall. You can get an *Exp. Candy XL* up here as well as a hidden *Hyper Potion*. Atop another waterfall is a hidden *Icicle Plate*. You'll notice that we can't access the other room thanks to a strong current - we'll need to transform the Water Surface into the Icy Field! You can use Blizzard yourself or surf until you find a wild Sealeo and hope that it uses it.

Enter the cave once it freezes over and you can get the *Aloraichium-Z* as well as the *Audinite*. You can also get a hidden *Exp. Candy L* and *Level Ball*. Exit this cave.

There is one more thing we can do in these apartment areas: we have one key remaining. Fly back to the Apophyll Academy and make your way east onto the sand strip to re-enter the Fairview Apartments area. Towards the top on the right side underwater you'll find the F10 building which contains the *Beedrillite*!

## Neo Azurine Island

To finish off our exploration of the Azurine Lake, we will next check out Azurine Island. Surf west from Coral Ward and go down when you're able to to reach Azurine Island once more.

Note that there are many Foongus and Amoonguss disguised as items, but fighting them now can save you some time for a later sidequest.

Just for fun, I will change it up and do a counter-clockwise spiral inwards this time to get all the items.

Snag a *Tiny Mushroom* and hidden *Clever Wing* on the first island. Surfing to the left you can get a hidden *Big Mushroom*. Surf down from here and pick up the *Tiny Mushroom* towards the bottom left side of the area. Another *Tiny Mushroom* is to the right, and yet another *Tiny Mushroom* past the building to the right. You'll also find a hidden *X Sp. Def* here. Continuing our trip around the outside, you'll find a hidden *Elemental Seed* in a shrub. Above you can get a hidden *Blue Shard*. Towards the top of the loop, you can get a *Tiny Mushroom* and a hidden *Telluric Seed*.

Now, head down to the middle island and cut the tree. Follow the path right, defeat the Foongus, and jump down the ledge. To the right you'll find a hidden *Resist Wing*. Head right more from here and surf down, defeating Foongus as you go. Head left from here. Pick up a *Tiny Mushroom* as well as a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* to the left in a rock. Left from here is a hidden *Repel*. That does it for this island, for now.

## Trading Sequence Quest

Now, it's time to do something with the Diamond Ring we found underwater. Fly over to Jasper Ward and enter the top left building. Inside, give the girl here the ring we found to get the *Classified Information*.

Next, head over to Peridot Ward and enter the building to the left of the North Peridot Alley.

Defeat the cop inside and after a conversation you'll get the *Pink Pearl*. Grab the *Mind Plate* behind.

Fly over to Coral Ward and enter the northern warehouse. Talk to the girl with Spoink to get the *Crystal Ball*.

Fly over to Jasper once more and attempt to enter the building on the right side of the area.

Defeat the two trainers who challenge you, then enter the building. In the room at the top you can get a *Yellow Flute* and the *Starlight Arena Field Readout*. Head upstairs and talk to the lady to get the *'R' Key*! You can also talk to her again for some lore.

Head into the Blacksteam Shelter in Peridot Ward. In the room where we were once stuck in a cage, talk to Randall and return his key. In return, you'll get his **Klefki**!

You'll notice that our new Pokemon is actually holding the *Sanctum Key*. Head back down to Seventh Street with this key in your bag, and return to the subseven sanctum. In the mazelike room, enter the door on the left side with the key. Pick up the *Dark Material* and 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Read the green books for some lore and note the colors of the Arceus statues on the left for later, then head out. That's it for this questline right now!

## Agate Circus Fishing

With the Super Rod in our bag, there are some new Pokemon we can get in the circus-and-beyond area. Fly back to the Agate Circus. You can get a *Circus Application* towards the top of the area while you're here. For completeness here are all of the encounters:

## Beldum Quest

Time for a weird one.

Fly over to the Byxbysion Wasteland. Inside the hideout, drop all but 1 Pokemon in the PC - we are going to intentionally white out in a second, so this will save us a lot of time. If they have Memento or Explosion that's extra good, but make sure they are strong enough to also defeat a Level 47 Bouffalant.

Talk to the malfunctioning healing machine and plug in a data chip to fix it. Heal at this machine.

Fly over to Route 1 Nature Center and defeat a Bouffalant to climb a Tauros. Next, you'll need to white out while riding Tauros.

Once you reappear in Lana's house... you'll somehow still be on your Tauros, but I assure you this is not a bug but a feature.

Exit the building and go down. Hop down the ledge beyond the rock smash, and climb up the nearby ledge. Enter the cave and go into the secret path behind the left canister. Follow this path to the left and climb the ledge and push the boulder to reach the area where we once found Squirtle.

From here, climb the ledges up and to the right to reach the previously unreachable cave entrance. Climb the ladder and go up the ledge. Grab the *Big Nugget*, save, and talk to the broken canister at the top for a battle with a Lv. 1 **Beldum**. You'll have to be careful to not let it knock itself out with Take Down. Its low catch rate will also complicate things, so reset if you need to.

Once you're done, head outside and ditch Tauros. Thanks, Tauros!

## Mega Z-Ring Quest

There's one more major quest that we can take care of! If we skip this section and proceed with the story, this will actually be locked of for us for another two badges or so, so take care of this now if you don't wanna miss this excellent reward.

Head over to the Nightclub in North Obsidia. You'll see DJ Arclight inside if you've bought all of the Pokemon from the Seventh Street Pokemon seller. If not, now's a good time to get them all. Anyways, we'll be tasked with returning five of the Pokemon that we found then.

Head to Jasper Ward and take the Loudred out of the PC. Talk to a girl in the bottom left building two times and she will take back her Loudred.

Next, take Jigglypuff out of the PC and head over to the North Peridot Alley. Talk to the bottom guy a few times.

After defeating him, return to the Jasper Ward and give the Jigglypuff to the Loudred girl.

Fly over to the Apophyll Academy and get Makuhita out of the PC next. Talk to the girl in the middle of the rooms on the left side of the outside area. Fly back to North Obsidia and talk to Arc to get the *DJ Arc Autograph* and give it to the girl at Apophyll. Talk to her again to give her Makuhita, then once more after that.

Fly over to Spinel Town next and grab Roggenrola from the PC. Two buildings from the left of the museum, you'll find a guy who you can give Roggenrola back to. Talk to him again to get the *McKrezzy Autograph*. Return to the PC and prep your full team for battle, then talk to McKrezzy for a fight.

He has a strong team but with no field, it shouldn't be too much to devise a strategy to defeat him. Note that his Staraptor can use a Z-Crystal.

For winning, you'll get *TM15 Hyper Beam*.

Fly back to Apophyll and give Makuhita girl the autograph to get the *Headphones*, then go to Jasper Ward once more and give them to the Loudred girl.

Fly to Lapis Ward and enter the house to the left of the Pokemart. You'll learn that the lady's son has been kidnapped! Head back to the North Peridot Alley and talk to the Jigglypuff guy once more.

Fly over to Onyx Ward, prepare your team and save, then head to the rooftop.

This battle isn't particularly tough and a few fast sweepers can probably bowl through them. The problem is that you don't get to heal before the next fight, so try to limit your casualties as much as possible for this fight.

His Pokemon are pretty much all of the fast sweeper variety, meaning Trick Room or Tailwind support for a strong attacker may be the key here. Watch out for Bullet Punch on Scizor.

Once you win this gauntlet, fly back to Lapis Ward and put Vanillite into your party. Give it back to Eustace upstairs.

With all five Pokemon returned, return to DJ Arclight. Your prize will be the *Mega-Z Ring* - meaning we can now use the collection of Z-Crystals and Mega Stones that we've been building up. We will be getting more of these as well.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Complete the Mega-Z Ring Quest (+2 Arclight)

## Devon Corporation

With all of that content out of the way, we can finally proceed with the story! Return to the Grand Hall and talk to Ame. She'll task us with finding Arc, Victoria, and Adrienn.

Arc can be found outside his nightclub, Victoria in the Beryl Cemetery, and Adrienn outside their gym in Coral. Talk to Ame again once you've gathered them.

Enter the Underground Railnet and make your way to the room with the tracks that can be manipulated, then go into the second from the top path that leads to the room containing Aron - you'll know you're on the right track when you see an Absol.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Arclight you're ready to infiltrate Devon (+1 Victoria)
- Tell Arclight you're not ready to infiltrate Devon (-1 Victoria, -1 Arclight)

Talk to Arc and Victoria when you're ready, then go up the stairs and defeat the grunts! Note that your battle partner is decided by how many points with each character you have right now: you'll get Victoria if her score is at least two points higher than Arclights, and him otherwise.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Battle with Victoria in the Devon Basement (+1 Victoria)
- Battle with Arclight in the Devon Basement (+1 Arclight)

We can't get the Mega Stone in the corner quite yet. Up the stairs, head out the door into the main area and talk to the shining spot to get a *Radio Transceiver*.

Up the stairs, you'll see an electric floor mat. If the tile is lit it is safe to walk on, otherwise, your non Ground type Pokemon will take some damage when you step on it. You can use the A key to cycle between 3 sets of lit tiles. That's all you really need to know to scale this building. Note that it is always possible to clear each floor without taking damage.

Time for another fight with Victoria, the first in a while. You'll notice that she has a full and varied team this time, with lots of faster Pokemon but also a few bulkier options in the back. Hopefully you're well acquainted with the Factory Field by this point, so you can exploit that to win if you're stuck. Overwhelm her with a coherent singles strategy like Amplifield Rock + Trick Room or a set-up sweeper with speed support.

Once you win, proceed to the next room at the top. Our A-button transceiver will still work in this area, so keep that in mind before you step on floor tiles that push you into unlit tiles. In this part of the dungeon we'll need to activate wall panels to switch the direction of the floortiles.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/devon_001.png"/>

Activate monitor #1, then go up and activate monitor #2 above. Use the purple pads to go back down and reactivate monitor #1, then go left. You'll be forced up here: activate monitor #3 then go towards the right.

In the rectangular mazelike area, you can go up then right as soon as possible to heal at a Light Shard (yellow path), but you'll need to make your way all the way back to the mazelike area. To proceed, go right, up, up, then right and down to monitor #4. From here, simply go to the left until you're forced down, then left and up to the top left corner of the room.

At the top left corner of the area you'll see some familiar four-direction spinners. Essentially you can just cram yourself in at the top entrance of the top left spinner over and over until you emerge at the top right. Just be sure to change the transceiver to the correct setting corresponding to where you will land.

You can turn off the electric tiles in the top right side of the area at monitor #5 and proceed to the next section.

Time for our first fight with the DJ. This one has a bit more synergy with Factory Field out of the box thanks to four Electric type Pokemon, though he might change the field to Electric Terrain. Most of his Pokemon are fast and use mostly Special Moves - Luxray being the sole counterexample to the latter and Ampharos being the sole counterexample to the former. The common attacking types of Ground, Ice, and Fighting cover all of his weaknesses.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/devon_002.png"/>

Pro tip: there is a light shard later on in the next room, so you can ignore using the transponder for now and eat the electric damage.

Start by taking the right path up to monitor #1 (path A). Backtrack down a bit and follow the path to the right. The spinner will take you down and right - do a loop by going up and back to the right (path B). Using this spinner to go down and right now, go right, right, left, and left to get the *PULSE Readout 1* (path C).

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/devon_003.png"/>

You'll be forced to go down into the spinner again, so do the B-loop from before once more and then go down and right. Move right, right, up, and up to enter the upper spinner from the bottom, then go left and down to return to the central spinner (path D). Do another B-loop then go down towards the bottom-right spinner and make your way around it a few times so that you end up on its right side. Go up from here until you can go left, then cross the spinner to use monitor #2 (path E). Head left and down to reach the central spinner once more.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/devon_004.png"/>

Go down and right as before, using the bottom right spinner to reach the bottom right corner of the room, then go straight up (path F). Activate monitor #3, then make your way back towards the left side of the room and go up when you can (path G). Activate monitors #4 and #5 beyond, then follow the path to the stairs.

In the next room... well, may lord Budew have mercy on her soul.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/devon_005.png"/>

One more puzzle room for now. Follow the ropes to go up and pop out at the top on the left side, then go right back into the maze on the right side, going down, left, and up to the monitor. Follow the green path to the right. Use the spinner to reach the bottom, and use the Light Shard.

Activate monitor #2, go up to activate monitor #3, then go back down to turn off monitor #2. From here, all you need to do is go up onto the green tile path left into the bottom spinner - it will send you into chain reactions of spinners. Activate monitor #4 when you reach it, then go back to the left. Do the same for monitor #5. Turn the electric tiles to blue before continuing, then make your way up the massive chain to monitor #6. Go right and activate monitor #7, then go up. Activate monitor #8 and head into the next room when you are ready.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you did come to destroy everything here (-1 Eve, -1 Lumi)
- Say you didn't come to destroy everything here (+1 Eve, +1 Lumi)

ZEL has a decently well rounded core of Ice and Psychic type special attackers, with various boosting held items to increase their potency and Electric and Ghost moves to take advantage of both Factory and Short-Circuit. If a physical sweeper can get around Aurorus' sash and outspeed these four you'll be in a good  position. Umbreon can be tricky however, as it will punish said physical attacker with Foul Play, heal itself with Wish and watch you die slowly of poison while it uses Double Team to dodge your attacks. The icing on top is Magnezone, who has an incredible special attack stat and two different types of field boosted moves that can destroy most Pokemon with ease. Its biggest weakness in Ground is pretty much patched out thanks to it gaining the Levitate Ability.

To win this one, I recommend splitting your team into the anti-PULSE Magnezone segment and the anti-everything else segment, though these may overlap. With only 70 base speed and no speed EV's, you'll find yourself likely able to outspeed. Placing one or two strong hits will really be the key, so 2-3 Pokemon on your team with super-effective moves can do this job. For example, if you want to take it out with Special Fire-moves, figure out which Pokemon to use to get the sun out beforehand and which Pokemon you can use to knock it out. If you want to use Earthquake, get Gravity on the field or use Smack Down on it. The rest of your team can then consist of a Pokemon to handle Umbreon and a physical sweeper or two to deal with the rest!

Talk to ZEL in the bottom left corner, then head out, use monitor #9, and go left. Talk to this monitor to release your allies, then exit.

## Silvon Scope Quest

With all that out of the way we can proceed to the next badge. One more quest is open however; I'll cover that first.

Reenter the actual Devon Corp. building in Obsidia, and make your way upstairs. Now the floor tiles will be going crazy and you can't control them. Honestly, I recommend grabbing some potions and just healing once we reach the top, since we will only have to deal with a single battle against 3 Pokemon. You can even challenge yourself to see if you can win with 6 Pokemon at 1 HP.

You can pick up a *Devon Scope Model* as well as the *Electric Memory* and *TM81 X-Scissor*.

Exit Devon and enter the Silph building. Talk to the lady here to get the *Silvon Scope*!

Fly on over to the Beryl Ward. We can finally expose Kecleon, so if you ever get stopped by one feel free to destroy it for being in the way. Enter Rhodochrine Jungle next and make your way down to the Underroot.

Head left underneath the waterfall, and continue going left until you run into *TM33 Reflect*!

So yeah, you'll have to fight 12 of these guys. They're just Kecleon so there's a good chance you can just one shot all of them, especially if you're using field-boosted Rock Slide. Be careful of their types changing and the seemingly endless uses of Fake Out and Sucker Punch, however.

The cherry on top is that we have to fight a custom variant Kecleon as the final Pokemon in our 13v6 gauntlet. If you use a Fighting move on it, be careful as then it will have STAB with Drain Punch. I recommend having two or three Pokemon prepared  to deal with the first doubles fight, and the rest saved up to deal with this one, just in case.

Past here you can get a hidden *Repel* as well as **Treecko**!

Return to Beryl Ward. With the Kecleon gone, we can now access the library once more. Enter the left room and press the books in a familiar order.

Enter the secret door here to get *TM30 Shadow Ball* as well as the *Catching Charm: Amethyst*, a new item which increases our odds of capturing Pokemon.

One more quick thing if you'd like: Fly on over to Calcenon City and go to Route 4. Hop across the rocks at the lake during the nighttime to catch Ame's Absol.

## Amaranth Badge

That's it for the side content, so head down to the Coral Ward and talk to Adrienn in their gym.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you will become the champion (+1 Adrienn)
- Say you will not become the champion (-2 Adrienn)

They will then ask us to help out with a quest. It's optional but pretty easy and gives you some rewards, so why not. We have to search Reborn City looking for volunteers to help out with city cleanup efforts. There are 15 people we can get in total:

1. Coral Ward tunnel, brown-haired girl
2. Obsidia Ward Park, blue-haired girl against the right wall
3. Onyx Arcade, yellow-haired guy wandering around on the right side
4. South Obsidia Ward, yellow-haired guy in the bottom left corner
5. Obsidia Alleyway, yellow-haired girl wandering around
6. North Obsidia Ward, blue-haired glasses guy near the stairway
7. Lapis Ward, silver-haired woman in the park south of the PokeMart
8. Lower Peridot Ward, brown-haired guy wandering around east of the train station
9. Lower Peridot Ward, blue-hatted guy in the last building before the railnet
10. Lower Peridot Alleyway, black-haired girl
11. Blacksteam Shelter, black-haired guy on the couch on 1F in the bottom left corner
12. Jasper Ward, light brown-haired girl in the building to the left of the police station
13. Beryl Bridge, girl with blue ribbons on the left side of the bridge
14. Beryl Ward, tan-hatted guy left of the gym
15. Beryl Library, pink-haired child just above the entrance

Return to Adrienn after finding as many volunteers as you like. For finding at least 10, you'll get *Wise Glasses*! For finding all 15, you'll also get an *Ability Capsule* and a *Star Piece*!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Find 10-14 volunteers (+1 Adrienn)
- Find all 15 volunteers (+2 Adrienn)

With that out of the way, it's time for our 14th gym battle.

Adrienn battles us in Doubles, and their team is quite formidable. The fight will start on the Misty Terrain, which notably boosts their Dazzling Gleam offensively, and boosts the Sp. Def of all of their Pokemon by 1.5x. Combine this with two Pokemon that have Intimidate, and you'll be having a very hard time scoring knockouts. Granbull, Gardevoir, Togekiss, and the overlevelled Florges all function how you'd expect, but it's worth noting that Nature Power is activated via Prankster meaning Whimsicott can use Mist Ball with priority for free. You'll also notice that it has Tailwind - meaning it can change the field altogether to the Fairy Tale Field, upon which all the Fairy type and Steel type attacks will be boosted and Whimsicott gets Prankster boosted Sacred Sword. Mega Mawile becomes even more of a threat as a result, as well.

Although this team on these fields is particularly stacked, you do have some options. For one, you can usually get a free boost on the first turn with Wide Guard thanks to Rock Slide/Earthquake and Dazzling Gleam being oft used moves. Consider changing the field at first to Corrosive Mist Field if you can - it will cripple their team, but you do have to use Clear Smog, Poison Gas, or Smog twice to make that work. What tends to work better though is leaning fully into the Fairy Tale Field - you can blow the mist away yourself, then utilize boosted Steel moves to tear their team apart. Mawile is still a difficult threat to deal with, so if you can get around Mawile with some Steel attackers in the back, that may be a winning strategy.

For winning, you'll get the Amaranth Badge which boosts our cap to 85. You'll also get *TM99 Dazzling Gleam*!

# Episode 17: Rust Thicker Than Water

Before we leave the gym, head to the top of the room. You'll find a hidden *Heart Scale* up here. Heal up if you need to - if you've progressed the quest up to this point, you can also talk to the left side of the flowery 'X' to find Corin Rouge! Battle him.

Return to the north side of Peridot Ward and talk to the Corin Rouge lookalike here. He will jump on a train to escape! Darn.

Head into Jasper Ward now to talk to the Police Chief, who will give you *Safety Goggles*. This massive quest quest will be over soon, I swear.

Head down to the Lower Peridot Ward. If we previously did the Onix quest and got the Hiker moved into a new house, we'll find him southeast of the Pokemon Center, and he'll give us a *Choice Band* if we joined the Aqua Gang, and a *Choice Specs* if we joined the Magma Gang. Sweet!

Now that we've defeated Adrienn there is one more move tutor in Peridot Ward's Mosswater Market:

## Reborn Restoration Project 1

Head over to the Grand Hall. One of the guys behind the desk will be accepting donations for one of three projects.

We can only choose to fund one right now, then each of the other two as soon as we get the fifteenth and sixteenth gym badges respectively. You won't be missing out on anything in the long term depending on your choice here. If you want to make a more informed choice, read the following three subsections to see what the rewards are for each.

As soon as you fully fund a project, you will be able to access the Grand Hall basement, so head down there. The bottom room on the right contains an *Adamant Mint*, a *Modest Mint*, and 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Next door you'll find 2 *EV Boosters*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria in the Grand Hall basement (+1 Victoria)

If you enter the room at the very top and talk to the computer, you can get a *Lopunnite* and unleash Vulpix. Do it even if you don't like Mega Lopunny, trust me. There is one more quest we can start in the basement but I will cover it a bit later.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #1 (+1 Adrienn)

Anyways, the three options:

You'll be able to find Berries growing at the bottom, namely 2 *Lansat Berries*, 2 *Apicot Berries*, 2 *Petaya Berries*, 2 *Salac Berries*, 2 *Ganlon Berries*, and 2 *Liechi Berries*.

Enter the building and talk to a guy behind the counter to get a *GUM Key*. You can also grab a *SOLICE Application* here, which we will need if we're doing the Magma Gang application quest.

Outside, talk to the girl up and to the right of the SOLICE office and agree to help with her quest.

Fly over to Jasper and enter the Malchous Forest Park. Talk to Sandy when you're ready.

Thanks to Lv. 100 Farfetch'd, lots of Forest Field boosted Cuts, and Sandy's team being weak to a lot of their moves and Rain making it harder to burn the forest down, this team might come as more of a challenge than you might expect, but some good physically defensive Pokemon will be helpful here.

Once you succeed, your next destination will be the Water Treatment Center.

These things are tough but a powerful Ground type sweeper can probably do the trick. Once you win, Sandy will leave.

While we're down here, we can use the GUM Key that we got earlier. In the upper-right hand side of the Central Obsidia Water Grid you'll notice a locked door which we can now open. There is a puzzle beyond.

Essentially, we will need to move green sections of pipe into place so that they will complete the entire pipe circuit such that we end up in the upper right hand corner. This is a fun one to solve yourself, in my opinion, but here is a solution:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/gum_room.png"/>

- In the bottom left corner, move the vertical pipe (1) to the right one tile, into place.
- Head down from here and move the horizontal pipe (2) up two tiles, into place.
- Head all the way to the right side, as far right as you can go without moving more pipes. Up from here, push a horizontal pipe (3) up two, out of its place for now. Grab *TM84 Poison Jab* here.
- From here go straight down. Push the rightmost horizontal pipe (4) down two spaces, again out of its final place for now.
- Down from here, the left of the two vertical pipes (5) can be pushed left two spaces, into place.
- The pipe to the right, the other vertical pipe (6), can be pushed two spaces left as well, into place.
- Up and slightly left from here you'll see a column of horizontal pipes. You can safely push the bottom-most one (7) down four spaces, into place.
- Go up and push the second-from-the-bottom horizontal pipe (8) down four tiles, into place.
- From here, up and left a few tiles is a vertical pipe (9). Pushing it four tiles would put it in place - push it six to the left for now to keep the corridor open.
- For each of the next three horizontal pipes in the column (10, 11, and 12), push them down two tiles each, into their respective places.
- Next, make your way to the top-left side of the room. You'll notice two vertical pipes (18, 17) in a row at the top of the room, and below the right of the pair is another vertical pipe (13). Push this one (13) left six times, into place.
- Down from here is a horizontal pipe (14) you can push three tiles down, into place.
- The vertical pipe currently against the left wall (13) is the first in a long row of vertical pipes. You can now safely push the second vertical pipe in this row (15) left 8 times, into place.
- Down and right from here you'll find a horizontal pipe (16) that can be pushed down four times, into place.
- Go straight up, and push the two vertical pipes along the top wall (17, 18) right four tiles respectively, into place for both.
- You can now safely push the third in the long row of vertical pipes (19) left six spaces, into place.
- Go right and down. You'll see a horizontal pipe (20) that you can push down four spaces into place.
- Down from here you can push another horizontal pipe (21) up two spaces, into place.
- Go up from here to return to the right side of the area. Up from the long column you'll find a U shaped alcove. Push the top-left vertical pipe (22) two tiles right, out of place for now.
- You'll now be able to push the fourth vertical pipe (23) in the long row left four tiles, into place.
- Head down to the bottom right corner. Push the bottom right pipe (4, previously moved two tiles down) up two tiles, into place.
- To escape from here, go up and left. Push the vertical pipe here (9, previously moved two extra tiles left) right now two spaces, into place.
- Go up and back into the U-shaped alcove. Push the third and second vertical pipes from the right in the long row (24, 25) left four times respectively, into place.
- Push the final two horizontal pipes remaining nearby (26, 27) down twice, into place.
- Push the vertical pipe in the top left corner (22, previously moved right twice) left twice, into place.
- To escape the alcove, push the vertical pipe on the right side (28) right twice.
- Only two pipes (3, 28) remain out of place: push them down twice and left twice respectively to finish the puzzle!

Talk to the computer in this area to get a **Goomy**!

If you push the nearby vertical pipe left two times to re-enter the U-shaped alcove, you can talk to the pipe on the wall to return to the front of the room.

With that out of the way, return to the Grand Hall basement. In the bottom right room, you'll find Sandy again. Talk to her in here... and after everything plays out, you'll get the *Waterium-Z*. Nice.

That's it for this restoration project.

### Railnet Reconstruction Project

Donate the $100000 to fund this project.

Essentially, this project funds a revamp of the Underground Railnet, so most of the things we can now get surround that. To start, head to Peridot Ward and head east into the Underground Railnet entrance under Opal Ward.

This area is the "Lost and Found". Always obtainable here are the *Assault Vest* and *Iron Plate*. If you realize that you missed out on getting any important items due to story progression such as Key Items, PULSE and Field Readouts, or TMs, check back here and they might just be here!

Next, enter the Devon Co. building and head down the stairs. The basement stairs will be blocked off, allowing us to grab the *Steelixite*!

Enter the railnet building to the left of the Pokemon Center in Obsidia. This is now the Goldenrod Station of the functioning railnet - we will be visiting each station to see what's new there. We don't lose money buying tickets, but the subway isn't really any more useful than Fly, which we already have, so this is really just for exploration.

Anyways, the Grandview Station is just the building we used to get to the desert previously, so there's nothing new there. The Ivyline Station is in the basement of the Onyx Trainer School, but we also aren't getting anything other than NPC dialogue there. Same for the Sunset Station, which is just outside in Northern Peridot Ward. Continuing the bad luck of no rewards is the Heatherhill Station which brings us to the Jasper Ward Pokemon Center, and the Peony Station, which brings us to a random building in the Lapis Ward.

The Kingsbury Station though? It brings us to a random building in Beryl Ward, but an NPC inside will give us the *Weakness Policy*. Insert world's longest "yea boi" here. But the Shantyport Station in Coral Ward? That's where the real reward is at. Bring an NPC in here a Probopass for an in-game trade for his **Togepi** egg. Nice.

I jest, but there is one more reward we can get out of doing this renovation project. In the Grand Hall basement, a nerdy NPC in the bottom left corner will tell us about an issue with the railnet renovation. Prepare your team as needed and head over to the Byxbysion Wasteland.

Via climbing through the building as we have before, hop down a ledge at the top to reach the upper left corner of the wasteland, and enter the cave. Go left, and follow the path into a building which contains a hidden *Telluric Seed* and *Exp. Candy XL*. Proceeding left, you can enter one final section of the underground railnet. Be prepared for a mini-gauntlet.

This fight exploits the cave field to collapse in on your Pokemon - instantly KO'ing most Pokemon. The Sturdy + Custap Berry combo makes it common for each Pokemon to get two attacks against you, so one collapse each. Without preparedness... that means you will lose all six of your Pokemon before the other fight! There are lots of strategies you can use to succeed here, however. Moldbreaker or multi-hit moves like Bullet Seed solve the Sturdy issue, allowing you to easily win. You can also use Power Gem constantly to change the field and prevent a collapse, or have a Bulletproof or Rock Head Pokemon do the whole fight since they are immune to the collapses. The Aron and Lairon will collapse themselves, so you could also just have something spam Wide Guard since you'll be safe from the collapse damage.

Possibly benefitting from the collapses your team suffer in the first battle, this doubles team goes all in on a similar strategy, this time with Rock Head to prevent any of the Aggron from taking collapse damage. With their Seeds, they'll gain defense, so your physical moves won't easily take them down in time. Wide Guard is even better this time, as your second active Pokemon can then focus on knocking out the Aggron. You can also just point-blank sweep them with two Pokemon running Aura Sphere, Focus Blast, Earth Power, Surf, and the like, so that's an option too. Again Bulletproof and Rock Head trivialize this fight.

Once you succeed in here, you can get the *Aggronite* and a hidden *Ultra Ball* and *Max Repel*. There are also encounters down here.

### Azurine Nature Center Project

Donate the $80000 to fund this project.

Surf on down to the Azurine Island once more from Coral Ward, and make your way to the building at the bottom. This will then be added as a Fly location, so you can easily get back here in the future.

Inside the building, you can get a *Toxic Plate*. You can also learn about the password *weathermod*. Upstairs, you'll find 5 *Exp. Candy XL*, as well as an *EV Booster* and *Max Ether*. If you didn't do the Chikorita event earlier, you can get it on the roof now.

In front of the building, a person will offer you an in-game trade: your Carnivine for a **Chimchar** egg. Nice.

The Azurine Island itself has been renovated as well, and we can get a few limited-choice Pokemon now!

Time to finally comb the Azurine Island for items one last time. We're also going to encounter more Foongus and Amoonguss in disguise, make sure you defeat or run from them to get them out of the way for a quest here.

This time I'll go left from the building to start. Grab the hidden *Big Mushroom* here, then another *Big Mushroom* to the left. Defeat the nearby Amoonguss, then head right. You'll find a hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and a non-hidden *Big Mushroom* below. To the right and down is another hidden *Big Mushroom* in a bush. Going up from here you can find, shocker, a hidden *Big Mushroom* left of the water.

Up the river is another hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and one out in the open to the left. Here you can meet the guy asking us to eradicate the Foongus and Amoonguss - once we finish we will return to him. To the left of him you'll find... a hidden *Blue Shard*! Surprise! Anyways, surf up and to the left from here to get a hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and a hidden *Common Candy* in a bush below. Another *Big Mushroom* is hidden on the same island where we once landed for the first time. Down and to the left you can get a hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Across the water on the largest island, you can pick up another *Big Mushroom*, and a hidden *Full Heal* to the right.

Down the ledge and across the water, talk to the nature guy once more to get a *Rocky Helmet*. Sweet.

There is one more thing we can do for this restoration project. Fly over to the Grand Hall and go to the basement. In the top right hallway, you can talk to a guy who will tell you that they are looking for sample Pokemon at Azurine Island. Fly back there.

A lady on the left will give us 2 *Leaf Stones* and a mission: to donate a male and female each of Lurantis and Simisage. I recommend just breeding each using the incubator until you get the desired gender, then leveling the Fomantis up to get Lurantis and using the Leaf Stones on Pansage to get **Simisage**. Donate all four and return to the Grand Hall to get the *Grassium-Z*.

That's it for this restoration project.

## Gang Application Sidequest

The train station in Lower Peridot where we started our journey is now open. Inside, someone will give you the *Construction Application*.

Make your way down to Seventh Street and find your corresponding gang leader. He'll ask us to give matching job applications to each of the members of their gang. Note that the blast powder salesmen will still sell to you on their respective jobsites. Anyways, the correct applications:

|Magma Gang Member |Application        |
|------------------|-------------------|
|Darm              |Circus             |
|Nihil             |Nightclub          |
|Break             |Medicine           |
|Kriz              |Spyce              |
|Maxwell           |SOLICE             |

Note that if you haven't fixed the slums yet, you won't be able to finish this quest with the Magma Gang yet. For completing it all you'll be given **Oshawott** holding a *Choice Band*.

**Aqua Gang Applications**

|Aqua Gang Member |Application        |
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Razzy            |Sweet              |
|Defacto          |Library            |
|Pierce           |Apophyll           |
|Mannie           |Construction       |
|Archer           |Silph              |

For completing this quest, you'll be given a **Litten** holding *Choice Specs*.

## Starter Egg Quest (Part 1)

Head into the Grand Hall basement and enter the middle room on the left side. Kanaya will task us with donating one egg of each of the 21 starter Pokemon!

Regardless of choices, it is guaranteed that you will have been able to obtain Charmander, Squirtle, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko, Mudkip, Turtwig, Piplup, Tepig, Chespin, Fennekin, and Popplio, bringing our total to a minimum of 13 starters so far. You can search the page for these events if you'd like to get them now.

You may have Oshawott or Litten if you completed a gang sidequest, and you may also have Bulbasaur and Chimchar if you upgraded Azurine Island. Potentially you may also have one more starter, chosen at the very beginning, but for now I will just assume we have only the ones every player is guaranteed to have. Feel free to also donate these if you have them as well.

If you have the incubator, doing this breeding shouldn't take too much time, so get eggs of these 13+ Pokemon now. For donating 3, 6, 9, and 12, we'll get the *Reset Disc- HP*, *Reset Disc- ATK*, *Reset Disc- DEF*, and *Reset Disc- SPATK*. These will help us reset EV's to zero, helpful if you want to completely change up how you're running a Pokemon or get rid of junk EV's from the beginning of the game. As we get more (guaranteed) starters, we'll come back.

## Tourmaline Desert

Make your way to the train station in Lower Peridot Ward, and take the train out to the Tourmaline Desert.

### Reshiram Route Taka Fight

If you already fought Taka at the WTC, skip ahead to the next section.

If you didn't fight Taka at the WTC, now will be the time to fight him!

You'll notice that Taka's team is actually decently built for the Desert Field and sand, but again an Ice type can shatter him once Klefki goes down. As before, beware of a Shell Smash Minior sweep.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Taka that you will not keep on winning (+1 Taka)

Once you win, Taka will ask if you will let him join your party while you travel through the desert. There are gameplay reasons to doing this - he will heal your party after every fight and also has tons and tons of dialogue at the various subareas of the desert. You will have to be careful that he doesn't knock out wild Pokemon you want to catch, though you can return later once he is no longer with you.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to allow Taka to join you.**

It's worth noting that refusing him here sends you down a different story path than the Reshiram and Zekrom routes, often called the "Hell Route" by the community. (I've never played this route so if you notice inconsistencies with the guide on Hell Route please let me know.)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Don't allow Taka to come with you in the desert (-3 Taka)

If he does join you, you'll lose points for leaving the desert while he's with you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Leave the desert while Taka is your partner (-2 Taka)

Once you make your choice, it's time to start exploring the desert...

### Greater Tourmaline Desert

If you want to just blaze through the story, head straight up in the desert until you reach an area with tons of trains, then complete the 1R253 Scrapyard section and proceed from there. There are tons and tons of actually good Pokemon and items that become available around the desert, so we'll spend a while exploring side areas for now.

Tourmaline Desert is HUGE: I'll briefly explain my approach to 100% completion in the desert. Note that this doesn't matter much if you're not going out of your way to collect all the hidden items, so you can just grab the items and Pokemon that you want and ignore the complications.

There are actually 4 versions of the main, large Desert map depending on where the desert's oasis currently is, which is randomly determined to start. Each of these four maps has its own set of hidden items as well.

What I recommend is exploring the map you have landed on first without touching any of the oases - touching the light shard nearby the oasis will switch the map you're on. Doing this exactly 3 times will switch a DIFFERENT desert map between two versions, *but we don't want to do this just yet*. I will number the four maps 1, 2, 3, 4. Note that when you switch the map you're on you'll go to a random, different number, so to be sure you'll have to search for the oasis every time.

To find the map you're on to start, you'll want to find your oasis. I provide images of each oasis below.

Oasis 1: On the upper/middle of the left side of the desert
<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/oasis1.jpg"/>

Oasis 2: Middle of the right side of the desert
<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/oasis2.jpg"/>

Oasis 3: On the lower/middle of the left side of the desert
<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/oasis3.jpg"/>

Oasis 4: Bottom of the right side of the desert
<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/oasis4.jpg"/>

So, once you find the map you're on, now we can start getting things!

Constant throughout the desert are the water encounters:

You'll also find many stationary **Exeggutor-Alola** around the desert.

For what it's worth, there are transitions from each map into two OTHER maps... which we will explore later. For now, keep in mind you don't want to go more north than these two images, the northwest and northeast borders:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/td_nw_border.jpg"/>

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/td_ne_border.jpg"/>

For now, don't enter any train cars yet, either.

First, I'll start by covering all the items that you can get only once and are available on all the maps. These are all generally worth getting and I'll point you roughly towards them. This is also a good time to get acquainted with the layout of the desert! For the sake of grabbing all these items, I will generally travel along the outside of the desert starting in the upper left corner, going counter clockwise along the outside of the desert, with occasional dips into the center of the map. Note that the large opening in a sand dune is Sugiline Cave. We'll explore there later.

Note that Taka often has something to say when you find these if he is with you.

For now, grab the items available on all four maps plus those on the specific oasis variety you are on; we will grab the rest later.

**On all maps (only obtainable once)**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/tourmaline_items_main.png"/>

- In the top left corner up on a hill, you can get hidden 3 *Exp. Candy XL*.
- As you climb down the top left hill, go slightly right as you head down. You'll see a *Stone Plate* on top of a hill.
- As you head down the left wall of the desert, you'll see one wide green tree. Head east from here across a dune, you'll see a broken statue. The main statue is too faded to read, but the broken off gargoyle contains a hidden *Max Elixir*.
- Continuing to follow the left wall down, you can hop across some blocks after defeating some Exeggutor-Alola to get *TM72 Volt Switch*!
- In the bottom left corner of the desert, you'll be able to pick up a *Focus Sash*.
- On the very bottom-middle of the desert you can find 6 *Poke Balls*, one is hidden. Especially with Taka in your party, you may realize where these six balls came from...
- Hugging the right wall of the desert, you'll find a *Relic Copper*.
- Past Sugiline Cave, hugging the right wall and going up, you'll find a *Max Elixir* near some dead trees.
- Up and to the right of the previous Max Elixir, you can find a hidden *Star Piece* in a rock.
- In the far northeast side of the desert, you can climb a sand dune to get onto a hill. Up and to the right you'll find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*.

Aside from all these items, each of the four maps has its own list of hidden items. These aren't even particularly worth searching for... but for completeness I list them here.

- Up and right from here, just before you reach the top right corner of the desert, beneath a mountain is a  broken statue head containing a *Steel Gem*.
- Hidden in a pile of rocks in the north east of here is a *Nugget*, and a *Green Shard* to the northeast in a bush.
- Go straight left from this area into the area with many train tracks. In a rock pile you'll be able to find a hidden *Protein*.
- Continuing left from here, slightly up is a hidden *Water Stone* fittingly in a cactus.
- Going straight left from here once more, you'll find a hidden *Poke Snax* in a rock.

- Just before the Sugiline Cave on the east side of the desert you'll find an area with a lot of cacti and bushes. Nearby are 3 hidden *Green Shards*.
- Straight to the left, you'll find a small grove of wide trees near a train track. You'll find a hidden *Escape Rope*.
- Up and left from here is a patch of green containing another hidden *Green Shard*.
- Follow the nearby tracks straight down to find a hidden *Fire Stone*.
- Go up and you hug the right wall, past Sugiline Cave. Near the dead trees, we can find a hidden *Purple Shard*.
- Continue north and slightly left from here. In a green patch with bushes and a cactus you can find another hidden *Purple Shard*. Following the nearby tracks left, you'll find a hidden *Ultra Ball*.
- Slightly up and to the right, you'll find a hidden *Burn Heal* in a statue head at the base of a mountain and a hidden *Big Pearl* in a bush to the right.
- In the northeast corner of the map, you'll find a hidden *Escape Rope* and *X Accuracy*.
- Left from here, in a rock beneath a hill, you can find a hidden *Purple Shard*.
- Go left from here. Nearby the train cars, you can find a hidden *Blue Shard* in a rock.
- Continue going farther to the left. Just before the final vertical train tracks is a rock containing a hidden *Awakening*.

Phew! That's everything we can grab in the Greater Tourmaline Desert.

Note that if Taka is with you:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka in the Tourmaline Desert while he's with you (+1 Taka)

It's also worth noting that Taka has 36 different dialogues, some changing depending on your current location. If you talk to him in any location and he asks if you hate his father, you'll potentially get another point.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Taka you don't hate Solaris (+1 Taka)

### Northwest Tourmaline Desert

Next, we're going to explore the northwest side of the Tourmaline Desert. Thankfully there is only one map this time and it is relatively narrow. Make your way to the northwest side of the greater desert and start following the tracks up. As before, don't enter any of the traincars quite yet.

The map:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/tourmaline_nw.png"/>

From bottom to top (ordered roughly) you can find hidden: *Blue Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Green Shard*, *PokeSnax*, *Stardust*, *Fairy Gem*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Red Shard*, *Blue Shard*, *Purple Shard*, *Common Candy*, *Super Potion*, *Max Repel*, *Poke Ball*, *PP Up*, *Water Gem*, *Green Shard*, *Great Ball*, *Ghost Gem*, and *Potion*.

You'll also notice a few non-hidden items: along the right side you can get a *Relic Copper* and a *Max Ether*. On the left side, you'll be ambushed by a dangerous trainer:

<div class="trainer_section"><table>
<thead class="table-header">

</tr>
</table></div>

Beyond him, you'll be able to get *TM08 Bulk Up*.

Note that at the very top of the area we won't be able to move on thanks to an intense sandstorm - this is actually the region's border, so don't worry about trying to pass here as we will not be able to. You'll also notice a cave entrance in the top left corner - this is the Teknite Cave. I am gonna explore here later on, but you can jump to that section if you want to explore it now.

### Northeast Tourmaline Desert

Next, we're gonna checkout the final part of the outside desert area. Make your way to the upper right hand corner of the greater desert area we've explored so far.

So, there are also multiple maps going on in the Northeast Tourmaline Desert, but thankfully there are only two and it's pretty easy to tell where you are. If you haven't messed with any oases yet, you'll be on the dirty version, which I will explore first.

The map:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/tourmaline_ne.png"/>

Roughly from bottom to top, you can find a hidden *Repel*, *Calcium*, *Blue Shard*, *Stardust*, *Purple Shard*, *Pop Rocks*, *Great Ball*, *Red Shard*, *Elixir*, *Purple Shard*, *Blue Shard*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Poke Ball*, *Shiny Stone*, *Green Shard*, *Pearl*, *Telluric Seed*, and *Rare Bone*.

At the wasteland at the top you can get *TM36 Sludge Bomb*!

With this map fully explored, now we can finally proceed to mess with the oases. Essentially, as explained before, each time you touch a light shard at a mirage, the map will switch to a different one. If you've done this any multiple of three times, the map on the northeast will transform from the dirty map to the clean map. So, go search for three mirages, grab the hidden items on the respective Greater Tourmaline map you land on if you'd like, then return here to explore the Mirage version.

The layout is the mostly same as before, but there are new items. Again roughly from bottom to top, you can find a hidden *Iron*, *Red Shard*, *Green Shard*, *Great Ball*, *PokeSnax*, *Purple Shard*, *Elixir*, *Red Shard*, *Oran Berry*, *Blast Powder*, *Aspear Berry*, *Repel*, *Magical Seed*, *Poke Ball*, and *Custap Berry*. By surfing you can find hidden *Star Piece*, *Full Restore*, and *Dusk Stone*.

Before we enter the Mirage Tower, there's another thing we can do out here if Taka is not a partner - otherwise, return here later. Surf around the back of the tower. There's a hidden stairs directly behind the tower we can use to get onto the mountainside. Follow this path to get a hidden *Stardust*, *Swift Wing*, and *Blue Shard*.

You can pet Leafeon here for the Eeveelution petting quest. By defeating the Lv. 100 Exeggutor-Alola in the pot, you can talk to the pot to get the *Dragonium-Z*! There is also a top tier NPC and shop here.

After buying as much lemonade as you can carry if you'd like, head into the Mirage Tower.

## Mirage Tower

Welcome to the Mirage Tower, one of my favorite side areas in the game. We can either climb the tower or access the secret basement. I will go with the basement first.

To reach the basement, you'll need to smash every mirror along the top wall with Rock Smash. Doing this will hurt your party members, so healing them if you don't have Taka may be smart. Speaking of Taka:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka in the Mirage Tower while he's with you (+1 Taka)

Anyways, head through the opened door to the basement.

This is a dark, mazelike room. To progress you will sorta have to do a clockwise spiral outward, grabbing items as you go. Hidden in the basement you can find a *Super Potion*, 2 *Red Shards*, *Purple Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, *Green Shard*, *Cotton Candy*, *Ghost Gem*, *Great Ball*, and *Heart Scale*.

Towards the top of the area, you'll notice a **Mimikyu** that you can battle and catch! Nearby it, you'll find the *Poison Memory* and a hidden *Elemental Seed*.

Return to the Mirage Tower proper. Next, we will climb the tower, solving puzzles as we go! Note that your actions on the block will affect the other, but the blocks won't move if pushed against a barrier. I will put the solutions in invisible text.

Puzzle 1:

So, we can get another legendary here, if you can call it that!

Although you might be tempted to head back into the tower, try heading down from here...

Following this path will lead us to the top of Mirage Tower! Here we can pick up the *Normalium-Z*, *TM04 Calm Mind*, and **Honedge**. Excellent rewards, and I recommend training this thing up right away if one of your team members is falling off, as Aegislash is one of the best Pokemon in this game!

That's it for the Mirage Tower for now.

## Sugiline Cave

Next, I'll take us to the Sugiline Cave. Head over to the east side of the greater desert and hug the right wall until you see a massive opening in a dune, then head in.

As in the other areas:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka while he's with you in the Sugiline Cave (+1 Taka)

Essentially Sugiline Cave has two floors: 1F, and B1F. Falling down a sand vortex on 1F leads you to B1F, but falling down a vortex in B1F brings you all the way back to the beginning of the cave. For this reason, I recommend quick-saving like crazy in here so you don't waste time and repels getting back to where you are.

On this first map, you can get a hidden *X Sp. Atk*, *Pop Rocks*, *Blue Shard*, and *Ultra Potion*. Drop down the bottom-left vortex first to B1F.

Grab the hidden *Elemental Seed* and *Big Mushroom* and take the ladder to 1F.

On this map you can get a hidden *Elemental Seed*, *Red Shard*, *Great Ball*, and *Ultra Ball*. Step into the bottom-left most vortex to get a *Max Elixir*. Unfortunately from here we have no choice but to step into the vortex to return to the front of the dungeon, so take the bottom left vortex and follow the path to where we were before.

This time, take the vortex up and slightly right from the pot that contained the Great Ball. In this area of B1F you can find a hidden *Cheri Berry*, *Protein*, and *Ether*. Again, we'll have to jump in a vortex from here and return to the 1F level above.

This time, take the top right vortex, then climb the ladder in the area you land in. Up here, pick up the *Draco Plate* and hidden *Super Repel*. Again jump into the vortices and make your way back to 1F.

Jump in the top left vortex this time. You can find a hidden *PokeSnax* in this room. Void out and return for the final time, in this section of the dungeon, at least!

Finally, jump into the vortex on the left side of the pot. Climb the ladder at the top of the rocky path.

In this next room, you can find a hidden *X Speed* and *Dark Gem*. Be extra careful here, as all vortices but the correct one will immediately yeet you back to the starting point. The correct one is the one in the middle of the top three, so head down it.

On B1F, be careful to not fall in again and pick up hidden *Telluric Seed*, *Super Potion*, and *Red Shard*, then climb the ladder on the right side.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* and proceed into the room on the right. Push the button in the Arceus statue to finish the left section of the cave! Make your way back to the entrance.

Next, step into the bottom right vortex in the entry room.

In this room, you can get a hidden *Carbos*, *Pecha Berry*, and *Blue Shard*. Climb the ladder at the top.

In this next room, you can find 2 hidden *Elemental Seeds*, *PokeSnax*, and *Green Shard*. Jump into the vortex on the middle of the right side of the room, below a cactus. Pick up a *Link Stone* then void out and return to the previous room.

Next, jump into the middle of the top three vortices. Be careful here as you grab hidden *Ice Heal*, *Antidote*, and *Star Piece*. Climb the ladder on the left side and push the button in the Arceus statue. Return to the front of the dungeon.

Next, enter the vortex at the very top of the entrance room. Down here you can find a hidden *X Speed* and *PP Up*. Climb the ladder to get a *Magical Seed* and hidden *Star Piece*, then return to the front of the dungeon.

Finally, hop down the vortex straight up from the cave's entrance. Here, you can find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Blue Shard*, *Great Ball*, and *Common Candy*.

In the next room, grab a hidden *Genius Wing* and *Exp. Candy XL*, then proceed into the next room. You might wanna save here - all the Garchomp statues can come alive and fight you!

While a fast Ice type can one-shot them, they can wear most teams down quickly. Technically you can actually get through this room without having a single battle with very careful movement!

Explore this room. You can find 2 hidden *Red Shards*, *Elemental Seed*, *Ultra Ball*, *Great Ball*, *Blast Powder*, *Purple Shard*, and *Iron*. At the top, you can get *TM71 Stone Edge*!

Talk to the Arceus statue at the top, and vortices will show up all around. Hop down any one of them to reach Sugiline Ruin B1F.

On this floor, you can find the *Medichamite*, an *Impish Mint*, *Bold Mint*, and 3 *Exp. Candy XL* as well as a hidden *Super Potion*, *Escape Rope*, 2 *Green Shards*, *Dragon Gem*, and *Muscle Wing*.

You can also interact with the basins around the area and put in some snax. Head up the ladder, then jump down the corresponding vortex above that basin. You'll be able to battle and catch **Gible**! Very nice. Head out of the dungeon via a nearby vortex and return to the desert.

## Teknite Cave & Teknite Ridge

Next, we're going to take a trip to the Teknite Cave in the northwest corner of the Tourmaline Desert. You can save some time by having Pokemon in your party with Power Gem, a ground-shaking move (TM Bulldoze works), and Tailwind, but we can proceed without these moves by having wild Pokemon use them in battle. Enter the cave.

As in the other areas:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka while he's with you in the Teknite Cave/Ridge (+1 Taka)

In the first room, grab the hidden *Tamato Berry* then proceed to 2F. In the next, grab the *Mountain Field Readout*, *Dawn Stone*, and hidden *Magical Seed*.

You'll notice that the "stones shimmer with light" when you enter. As we know by now that means we have to change the field somehow to proceed - we'll need to transform the Cave Field into Crystal Cavern Field. The only way we can right now is via use of Power Gem - note that wild Carbink can use this move, so if you don't have it on you, you can just encounter one and hope it uses this move. After the cave is transformed, use the red crystal to create a rock smash wall, and proceed to 3F.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* then transform the field to Crystal Cavern. Use the green crystal to remove the obstacle. Note that we won't be able to proceed - you'll need to use Bulldoze, Earthquake, Magnitude, or Fissure to switch back to Cave from here. If you don't have these moves, wild Sandslash, Dugtrio, and maybe others should have one of these moves. Once the field is changed and a gem is destroyed to clear a path, move to the top of this room then switch to Crystal Cavern once more. Use the crystal, smash the wall, and proceed to 4F.

Switch to Crystal Cavern, then remove the obstacle. Grab the hidden *Iron* and *Potion*. Switch back to Cave and grab a hidden *Burn Heal* at the top and *Mental Herb* at the bottom. Enter the bottom left room to re-enter 3F, grab the hidden *Synthetic Seed*, and proceed to the room on the left.

Pushing the strength boulders out of the way, hop across to the bottom left corner to get a hidden *Relic Copper*. Hopping to the top right, you can get a hidden *Health Wing*. Finally, hop to the top left to re-enter Teknite Cave. Grab a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and proceed to the next Teknite Ridge map.

On this map, you can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Roseli Berry*, *Potion*, *Escape Rope*, *Quick Ball* as well as 3 *Exp. Candy XL* and *TM75 Swords Dance*. Hop across some rocks to the left to get a hidden *Nugget* and the *Mawilite*!

Return to the 4F map with branching paths, this time going up and right. On this map, fully exploring will require using Tailwind in a battle. This will allow you to now jump three horizontal spaces instead of two! Wild Pidgeot and Talonflame may use this move if you don't have it on you.

Hop your way to the next by the entrance to get the *Pidgeotite*. Hopping to the right from here you'll find the *Ice Memory*. Back nearby the entrance, hop slightly up and left to get a hidden *Hyper Potion* in a rock. Hop to the landmass to your right, and grab the hidden *Leppa Berry*. Hugging the top left as much as possible, hop across to the top-left corner of the map. Jump down just one ledge, then go right. Hop to a nearby rock for a hidden *Level Ball*, then grab the *PP Max* at the top.

Hop back to the central landmass, this time climbing a bit higher and hopping to the right. It's a bit hard to spot, but to proceed, you'll need to hop at the top left corner of the next landmass up and around to the next landmass at the top. Hopping down one ledge, go right and hop up and around. Follow this path to the top of the hill to get a **Rowlet** egg!

That's it for the Teknite Range, so make your way back to the Tourmaline Desert.

## 1R253 Scrapyard

If you have Taka with you and want him to stay with you for more points, conversations, and free heals, save this area for later, as once we get a fair bit in, he will leave our side.

As in the other areas:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka while he's with you in the 1R253 Scrapyard (+1 Taka)

Time to proceed to the next story area! You've probably seen a large area surrounded by tons of traincars in the central northern desert - this is our destination. Actually, to start, make your way to the Northwestern Tourmaline Desert to start.

At the bottom right of this map but before you enter the Greater Tourmaline map, you will find a entrance to a train car. Go through this train car, and you'll emerge in the 1R253 Scrapyard!

Towards the bottom of the area you'll see a green train (1) with an open door - getting inside, we can use it to move forward, unless there is a Rock Smash boulder on the track. This puzzle is a pretty fun one in my opinion, so feel free to skip ahead until the next section if you'd like to try to solve it all yourself.

So, use this train (1) to go forward, pushing a different train onto some vertical tracks. From here, go straight up and into a train car. Follow the path through many different cars until you emerge once more. Smash the rock in front of a train (2), then backtrack through the cars to where we entered.. Going down then left and back up, you can now use the train at the top (2) to go right.

From here, you'll be... railroaded... into going to the right and down. Once you hop down a horizontal ledge look to the right to smash a rock in front of a train (7), then continue down your path. Finally, you'll be spit out in the main area of the scrapyard. If you enter the train cars at the very bottom, you can return to the Greater Tourmaline Desert, so if you need to fly out of here to heal, that's where you'll return.

Head up and enter the nearby train (3), then hop down the ledge to the left. Smash two rocks below and to the left, in front of trains (4, 5). Continuing left and down, enter the middle train (4). On top of the hill, grab the *Max Repel* and *Steel Memory*, then jump down. Head left around this hill and smash the rock in front of a train (6), then go back down below the hill, and enter the nearest green train to the right (5). This will drop you off near another green train (6), which you can now ride west.

From here, go down as far as you can, then head right. We are going to exit this area via the train cars at the bottom. Back on the outside of the scrapyard (see the bottom of the above map), head to the right, and you'll see another traincar entrance to the scrapyard. Use this entrance to re-enter the scrapyard.

This path will take you to a train (7), which you can now ride all the way left. Once it bumps a train out of the way, go down from here and enter the vertical train (8) to go up to enter a new map!

Grab the hidden *Dire Hit* and *Synthetic Seed* on the map. Enter the horizontal train in the bottom left (9), then climb the hill. Hop down the ledges to climb down the hill. Follow the new path (in red) far to the southwest to get 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, then jump in the nearby train (10) and ride it left. Head back to the top right and take the vertical train (11) for a ride downward!

Grab the hidden *Big Mushroom* and enter the nearby train car. Follow the path through these cars until you emerge once more into the outside air.

This area, sometimes referred to as Train Town, is a flying destination thankfully, so feel free to go do preps. If he has been with you so far, Taka leaves your party here as well.

Around this area, you can pick up a *Max Repel* as well as hidden *Common Candy*, *Purple Shard*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Aspear Berry*, *Red Shard*, *Poke Ball*, *Purple Shard*, and *PokeSnax*.

If Taka is with you, he will take a rest and lie down in a train car on the bottom right side of the area. Talk to Europa before you follow him if you like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Europa Taka is your boyfriend (+1 Taka)

You can talk to the residents of the Train Town and learn about them. In the bottom left train, if you've been to Mirage Tower, you'll see a warp that will bring you there. Handy.

Depending on the time of day, Bouffalant Bill will be either outside or in a train car on the upper right side of the area that contains a healing machine. He will sell us some stuff.

In a train car at the top of the area you can access a PC and meet Stephoscope. Talking to her twice after visiting Teknite Ridge, you'll be given the *Houndoominite*. Excellent.

More importantly than all that though... by talking to *him* on the east side of Train Town, we can finally finish *the* quest. You know the one - we started it 5 minutes into the game when the fisherman and his buddy sold us a Pokemon and then stole it from us. We've watched our Pokemon by rights get taken by a guy in the slums, stolen by both the Magma Gang and Aqua Gang, and taken into the possession of an associate of the slimy Seventh Street Pokemon salesman. Next it was stolen by Corin Rouge, who had three of his associates bamboozle us long enough to escape into the desert. We paid the *gold* price for the Pokemon sixteen episodes ago. But now it's time for Corin Rouge to pay the *iron* price by being defeated once and for all.

This cruel thief has a Z-move and some Pokemon with Desert Field synergy, but they shouldn't be too tough to take out. Just be careful of the sixth, who can easily sweep your team if you aren't careful.

By defeating him we can finally get our hands on our legendary weapon: **Magikarp**. I jest, but Gyarados is one of the strongest Pokemon in the game, so it is indeed worth it.

Make your way out of the Train Town via the train car at the bottom. In the next area you can get a hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *X Speed*. You'll notice an entrance to a train car in the top right corner, which is where we'll go to continue the story. For now there are a couple goodies in the scrapyard that we couldn't access before, so I'll get those first.

Down and right from here you can find the *Amulet Coin* and a hidden *Blue Shard*. Left of here you'll find a *Max Repel* and a hidden *Heart Scale* and *Green Shard*. Enter the train at the end of the path, picking up the *Exp. Candy XL* and *Star Piece* in the pit. Climb out via the railroad tracks, and follow the track that this train just took up to get *TM19 Roost*.

Next, head down from here, then left as soon as you're able. Make your way to the top left corner of the area, where you'll now be able to pick up a *Max Elixir*.

Now that Taka has left our party, we can grab the goodies that require Surf - notably the Dragonium-Z.

That wraps up all we can get in the scrapyard, so fly back over to Train Town, exit out the bottom and enter the train car in the top right corner of the next area.

Follow the path through a ton of train cars until you emerge... what?

## Once Upon a Somewhere

You'll find yourself in a new location entirely. Not what you expected, huh?

It seems like this first map is an infinite maze - it essentially is. Try biking in random directions until you see a set of stairs ascending upwards, then take those. It usually takes a minute or so.

On the next map, you can find a hidden *Green Shard* and *Sitrus Berry*. Proceed into the castle. Here, you'll have to fight some Knights as you proceed.

You'll wake up in a tower. Read the placards at each floor as you go up or down the stairs until you see a pile of books leading out of a window.

On the exterior of the tower, climb the vines. On the left at the top you'll see the *Dragon's Den Field Readout*. As you head right, Titania will talk to you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Titania you trust her, while you have >= 0 points with her (+1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you trust her, while you have < 0 points with her (-1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you don't trust her, while you have >= 0 points with her (-1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you don't trust her, while you have < 0 points with her (Titania's total becomes *min(0, c + 4)*), where *c* is the current number of points you have with her.

Complicated, but anyways, she'll give you the *Sapphire Bracelets*. Proceed right.

Grab the hidden *Super Potion*, *Ultra Potion*, and non-hidden *Dragon Fang* in the Belly of the Beast, then prepare for a battle. Depending on your choices, it'll be different.

If you're on, well, Reshiram Route, you'll get this:

At least now you know why the routes are named as they are. Win your conquest with whatever clever tactics or raw strength you need to slay a dragon, and proceed.

Pick up the hidden *Health Wing*, *Revive*, and *Lava Cookie* beyond, and watch the scenes play out at the top of the room.

Head up at the top to Titania's arena!

## Alloy Badge

Before starting the battle, you can jump into the blue hole at the top and go left from here if you want a shortcut to Train Town for some prep - there's a good chance your team won't be good enough for the upcoming gym fight. Anyways, up from here is a hole you can jump into to return to the tower. Along the way back to the gym, you'll even find a *Rare Candy*!

The Fairy Tale Field boosts Fairy and Dragon moves, along with giving Fire moves a Dragon sub-typing. It also boosts Steel moves and gives them effectiveness on Dragon. Defensively, Steel types already resist Fairy and Dragon, so with the nerf to Fire moves, Titania definitely uses the type best positioned on this field. Instead of Sandstorm, this fight is accompanied by Hail, which allows her Sandslash to outspeed and set up Aurora Veil if it likes. Past that, Empoleon, Excadrill, and Mega Scizor are all very strong steel types with lots of coverage, the latter even having a very nasty Technician, field boosted, priority Bullet Punch, and Excadrill a nasty boosted Smart Strike. Klefki is very annoying as usual thanks to prankster Paralysis on command but also humorously can sweep you with Calm Mind and boosted Draining Kiss to heal. As you'd expect, her Aegislash five levels above the cap with insane boosts on three of its moves is no slouch - bulking up when it uses King's Shield and getting stronger when it attacks, priority or otherwise. On top of this, Excadrill and Aegislash have Magical Seeds, protecting their Pokemon for a turn, lowering your stats if you try to attack them, and allowing them each to set up a +3 Swords Dance. Scary!

There are a good number of strategies that remain for you to use, thankfully. A Pokemon with Protect, Swords Dance, and a move like Earthquake or Brick Break can probably sweep through most of the team with a bit of speed control support as long as they can live a priority attack or two. There are a ton of abilities and moves that allow you to gain Defense, so if you're able to deal with Klefki and Empoleon there may be a working strategy involving going all in on Defense boosts to neutralize her attack boosts and such. There are also some boosts to attacks and abilities: Mystical Fire / Magician and Sparkling Aria / Oceanic Operetta do get boosted here if you want to try to sweep with your starter Delphox or Primarina! Queenly Majesty gives a boost to damage, combine this with its natural ability to cancel out Bullet Punch and Shadow Sneak, and Tsareena may end up being very helpful here. The Magical Seed giving a free turn can also be used by you, with the added bonus of you being able to hard switch in to a contact move to force a stat lower on one of her party members if need be. If you're really stuck, you can literally consider going 6 Magical Seeds held to grant yourself 6 free turns - this is what I did once upon a time to win this fight with a Fairy monotype.

For winning, you'll get the *Alloy Badge*, boosting the level cap to 90. You also get *TM91 Flash Cannon*.

Jump down the pit at the top and go left to return to Train Town.

## Reborn Restoration Project 2

Pokemon Reborn Episode 17 actually came out and allowed players to get two badges, so there is still a bit of content left in the chapter. First is some optional content.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in Calcenon City after defeating Titania (+1 Hardy)

If you haven't yet gotten the Mega-Z Ring, the quest will now be opened back up if you'd like to complete it now. Head over to the Nightclub and talk to Arclight to get started, then checkout the respective [section of the walkthrough](#mega-z-ring-quest) for steps. 

Even if you have completed this part, fly over to the Nightclub anyways, where you can pet Jolteon for the quest.

Now that we've defeated Titania, there is one more move tutor in Peridot Ward's Mosswater Market:

<div class="tutor_table"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mosswater Market Move Tutor: Tim</strong></th></thead>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Superpower</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">8 Blue Shards</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Earth Power</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">9 Green Shards</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Heat Wave</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">9 Red Shards</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

Head over to the Grand Hall. Now that we've beaten Titania, we can fund another restoration project.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #2 (+1 Adrienn)

If you'd like to complete another one, the choices and corresponding references are here:

- [Affordable Living in Obsidia](#affordable-living-in-obsidia-project) ($60000)
- [Railnet Reconstruction](#railnet-reconstruction-project) ($100000)
- [Azurine Nature Center](#azurine-nature-center-project) ($80000)

There is one more thing we can do before continuing: fly over to Calcenon City.

## Torrent Badge

With that out of the way, we can pretty much head right to the next gym. Fly to the Celestinine Cascade and enter the Fiore Mansion. You can pet Vaporeon for that quest, and talk to Julia for some A+ gym advice. Enter the gym room at the back.

### Reshiram Route: Fiore Gym

If you're on the Zekrom Route, [jump to the next section](#zekrom-route-fiore-gym).

Unfortunately this gym's layout is super confusing, but I will guide us through. For now, dive down here and then make your way down at the three-way fork. Thankfully this way is very linear, so go straight. Once you have two waterfalls to choose from, go up the left to get a hidden *Heart Scale* then proceed.

Surface in the gym room, then talk to Amaria. Use the warp to return to the front of the gym, for it's time to look for Amaria. You'll need to find her three times.

This time, head right at the underwater fork. When you surface, you can get a hidden *Full Restore*. The path from here is linear. When you surface next, you can get a hidden *Ultra Potion* on the left. Continuing, when you encounter a fork, go down instead of left. Amaria #1 is encountered in the next room, on the left side of the loop.

Continue into the next room in the bottom right. Going right at the fork will lead you to an *Elemental Seed*. Follow the path through, surfacing. Continue to follow the path at the next dive spot. At the fork, go left instead of right.

Exit this next room at the top and surface to get a *Max Revive*. Dive back down, this time exiting the large room in the southeast exit. Exit this room on the northeast side.

Go left at the first fork to reach the *Slowbronite*! Back at the fork head straight up, and then left as soon as you can to surface. There's a hidden *Ability Capsule* at the base of the waterfall. Grab it, then head back up the waterfall and dive down into the room we were just in. In the southeast is Amaria #2. From here, head into the room we previously visited in the southwest corner.

You'll find Amaria #3 in the pocket towards the center of the room.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Find Amaria #3 and say no (-4 Amaria)
- Find Amaria #3 and say yes (-3 Amaria)

After the scenes that play out here, you'll end up in the Fiore Mansion. Prepare yourself, then return to the gym when ready.

Take the teleporter to the gym arena and talk to Amaria.

Amaria will ask you if you want to battle in Singles or Doubles - but she'll actually challenge you in the format opposite of what you request!

Surprise, the Water gym leader has a team built for the Water Surface and Underwater Fields. These fields, especially the latter, are pretty suffocating for most Pokemon, drastically slowing them down and allowing Amaria to hit hard with Whirlpool, Dive, etc. On the surface Electric types and maybe Grass types can get away with their usual tricks somewhat, although with Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Swampert you won't have the easiest time sweeping and the group all have lots of coverage, and on Reshiram route only, the latter can Mega Evolve! These three also have Swift Swim, which is always on for these two fields. Wishiwashi doesn't stop schooling, so keep that in mind. Lapras with its seed and Curse can set up on you and is also immune to status conditions on these fields, so you might be in for a shock if it sets up and is unkillable. This team isn't super complicated, just hits hard and is prepared to deal with most of what you throw at it.

You can consider trying to change up the field - Murkwater Surface can wear down her Pokemon with chip damage... although she can change it back with half of her team's Whirlpool. Icy Surface can allow you to actually use hazards and ignore all the speed shenanigans... although she can change it back with Swampert's Earthquake or two uses of Kingdra's Scald. You can also create a team specifically for one of the fields. Raichu-Alola for example does great on the Water Surface, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokemon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokemon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water type moves. Especially Underwater, your own Water types with Swift Swim can be very useful here as well - if you can get past her Kingdra, your own Ludicolo can be particularly good here. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.

Amaria's Doubles team is built well around the Water Surface and the spread of Surf to your party while taking little/no damage from the spread to her party members, as Vaporeon and Seismitoad both have Water Absorb. This means your own Water types will potentially have a harder time on this fight than the singles fight. With Primarina'and Blastoise's coverage, Lanturn to check your Electric types and no-status condition Lapras to potentially ruin a sweeper's day thanks to Perish Song and Protect, she has a pretty bulky team that can deal with lots of teams you attempt to use. On Zekrom Route only, her Blastoise can mega-evolve, making its Aura Sphere a bit stronger and raising its stats somewhat.

As with the singles fight you may consider transforming the field. Murkwater Surface will deal passive damage to her team members each turn... but Lanturn and Blastoise may change it back with Whirlpool. Icy Field helps alleviate the speed issues, boosts, etc... but can be changed back with Seismitoad's Earthquake. The latter is potentially a good route to go with if you have a fast special-attacking Grass type who can one shot Seismitoad on turn 1. You can also try using the Water Surface or Underwater to your advantage - without Swift Swim on any of her Pokemon, bringing some Swift Swimmers of your own might let you outspeed and crush her with the right setups. Raichu-Alola can do ok on the Water Surface in this fight, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokemon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokemon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water type moves. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.

Regardless of which fight you chose, you'll be rewarded with the *Torrent Badge* and *TM55 Scald*. Sweet.

If you're on the Reshiram Route, [jump to the next section](#episode-18-void-kissed).

At the fork, go left instead of right. The next room contains Amaria #1 swimming around the upper loop.

Exit this room at the top and surface to get a *Max Revive*. Dive back down, this time exiting the large room in the southeast exit. In a loop to the right, you'll find Amaria #2. Exit this room on the northeast side.

Go left at the first fork to reach the *Slowbronite*! Back at the fork head straight up, and then left as soon as you can to surface. There's a hidden *Ability Capsule* at the base of the waterfall. Grab it, then head back up the waterfall and dive down into the room we were just in. In the northeast is Amaria #3. From here, head into the room we previously visited in the southwest corner.

Continue through this room and follow the path to the next in the bottom left corner. Exit the next room via the left-most exit, and at the fork in the next room, go right. Surface here, then follow the path at the next dive spot. This is the fork where we started our diving, so enter the door at the top and surface, then leave. Prepare yourself, then return to the gym when ready.

Take the teleporter to the gym arena and talk to Titania, then to Amaria.

Amaria will ask you if you want to battle in Singles or Doubles.

These fields, especially the latter, are pretty suffocating for most Pokemon, drastically slowing them down and allowing Amaria to hit hard with Whirlpool, Dive, etc. On the surface Electric types and maybe Grass types can get away with their usual tricks somewhat, although with Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Swampert you won't have the easiest time sweeping and the group all have lots of coverage, and on Zekrom route only, she'll have a Dragon type Z-move. The first two also have Swift Swim, which is always on for these two fields. Wishiwashi doesn't stop schooling, so keep that in mind. Lapras with its seed and Curse can set up on you and is also immune to status conditions on these fields, so you might be in for a shock if it sets up and is unkillable. This team isn't super complicated, just hits hard and is prepared to deal with most of what you throw at it.

You can consider trying to change up the field - Murkwater Surface can wear down her Pokemon with chip damage... although she can change it back with half of her team's Whirlpool. Icy Surface can allow you to actually use hazards and ignore all the speed shenanigans... although she can change it back with Swampert's Earthquake or two uses of Kingdra's Scald. You can also create a team specifically for one of the fields - Raichu-Alola for example does great on the Water Surface, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokemon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokemon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water type moves. Especially Underwater, your own Water types with Swift Swim can be very useful here as well - if you can get past her Kingdra, your own Ludicolo can be particularly good here. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.

Amaria's Doubles team is built well around the Water Surface and the spread of Surf to your party while taking little/no damage from the spread to her party members, as Vaporeon and Seismitoad both have Water Absorb. This means your own Water types will potentially have a harder time on this fight than the singles fight. With Primarina'and Blastoise's coverage, Lanturn to check your Electric types and no-status condition Lapras to potentially ruin a sweeper's day thanks to Perish Song and Protect, she has a pretty bulky team that can deal with lots of teams you attempt to use. On Zekrom Route only, her Blastoise has a Fighting type Z-move, as well.

As with the singles fight you may consider transforming the field. Murkwater Surface will deal passive damage to her team members each turn... but Lanturn and Blastoise may change it back with Whirlpool. Icy Field helps alleviate the speed issues, boosts, etc... but can be changed back with Seismitoad's Earthquake. The latter is potentially a good route to go with if you have a fast special-attacking Grass type who can one shot Seismitoad on turn 1. You can also try using the Water Surface or Underwater to your advantage - without Swift Swim on any of her Pokemon, bringing some Swift Swimmers of your own might let you outspeed and crush her with the right setups. Raichu-Alola can do ok on the Water Surface in this fight, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokemon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokemon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water type moves. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.


Regardless of which fight you chose, you'll be rewarded with the *Torrent Badge* and *TM55 Scald*. Sweet.

# Episode 18: Void-Kissed

Exit the gym! Time to progress the story just a little bit in order to knock out some sidequests.

Head over to Calcenon City, then enter "that one apartment building where a bunch of plot happens, for some reason". You know the one.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree with Hardy about charging the base (+1 Hardy, -1 Florinia)
- Disagree with Hardy about charging the base (-1 Hardy, +1 Florinia)

Head out towards Route 4. In the gatehouse, talk to Charlotte if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you believe her while you have >= 0 points with her (+1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you believe her while you have < 0 points with her (-1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you don't believe her while you have >= 0 points with her (-1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you don't believe her while you have < 0 points with her (+1 Charlotte)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you are going to do something about it (+1 Charlotte)

Head out to Route 4. On the east end of the right, you'll see Hardy standing next to a Rock Climbing wall, and as you might guess, he gives us *TMX9 Rock Climb*. Up the nearby hill would be where we'd go to continue the story, but we do have a few sidequests to take care of in the meantime!

## Reborn Restoration Project 3

With 16 badges in hand, we can finally complete the third and last of the Grand Hall restoration projects.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #3 (+1 Adrienn)

Once you've funded all three projects, the guy at the desk will give you the *Absolite*.

If you'd like to complete another one, the choices and corresponding references are here:

- [Affordable Living in Obsidia](#affordable-living-in-obsidia-project) ($60000)
- [Railnet Reconstruction](#railnet-reconstruction-project) ($100000)
- [Azurine Nature Center](#azurine-nature-center-project) ($80000)

## Starter Egg Quest Part 2

Since the last time we made progress on this quest, it is now guaranteed that we can complete all three of the restoration projects, meaning by now it is guaranteed that we can breed Bulbasaur, Chimchar, and either Oshawott or Litten depending on gang choice. We also recently found Rowlet, so we can donate four more eggs to Kamaya in the Grand Hall.

This brings the total up to 17/21 eggs donated; since we passed 15, that means we get the *Reset Disc- SPDEF* as a reward. The next time I will bring us back here, we will for sure have the last four starters to finish this quest.

## Rock Climb Exploration

We've chopped down menacing small trees. We've smashed brittle rocks and pushed aside heavy boulders. We've crossed massive bodies of water, gone up perilous waterfalls and dived down to the deepest trenches imaginable. We've lit up the darkest of dungeons and flown across the vast Reborn Region. But now? It's finally time to climb rocks.

You can probably tell we're reaching the endgame, so there are tons of excellent but optional rewards that we can now get with Rock Climb. Follow along to grab 'em all, or jump to the Route 4 section to get on with the story. Note that any rock walls that I don't mention here are merely shortcuts (and, mostly obsolete thanks to Fly).

### Climbin' at Azurine & Apophyll

I'll start with some easy ones. Fly over to Azurine Island. Surf up from the nature center - towards the middle of the big island, you'll see a climbable wall. At the end of the short path above it, you'll be able to pick up the *Poisonium-Z*!

Next, fly over to Apophyll Beach. Make your way towards Pyrous Mountain, and climb down to get *TM52 Focus Blast*. Hope you don't miss!

### Climbin' at Teknite Ridge

First, fly over to the desert. Make your way all the way to the Teknite Cave in the northwest. Progress through the cave until you reach the split paths on 4F. Use the top left exit and make your way all the way to the dead end.

By hopping across some rocks to the top left corner, you'll notice a climbing wall. At the top, you can find a hidden *Ability Capsule* and a **Jangmo-o** egg! Sweet.

That's not all we can do in the Teknite Ridge, but we will be accessing a different side of the ridge to finish up.

Fly over to the Beryl Ward, and enter the Beryl Cave. On 1F, you can use Rock Climb to access a new area. Grab the hidden *Red Shard* and head into the next room, which has a hidden *Hard Stone*. Climb up once more to emerge into a new section of the Teknite Ridge.

Grab the hidden *Heart Scale*. We'll need to transform this field to Dark Crystal Cavern - using the TM for Dark Pulse, this should be doable.

A fight against one strong Pokemon! Pick up the *Catching Charm: Ruby* here, as well as the hidden *Fire Stone* and *Ability Capsule*. Talk to the sunburst thing in the top right side of the room to battle and catch **Larvesta**!

Exit the cave. You can fly out from the Ridge.

### Climbin' at Route 2 and Route 3

Fly to the Celestinine Cascade. By heading down the stairs from the Fiore Gym, climb the first rock wall you see to get *TM28 Leech Life*. If you haven't moved the nearby Crustle to access the cave behind it, Rock Climb will make doing this easy.

Make your way to the north side of Route 2. On the right, you'll see a short climb leading to 5 *Exp. Candy XL*.

Next, climb the ladder to Route 3. Climb down the single tile Rock Climb to skip the first cave, then go as far right as you can. Enter the next cave and climb the rock in the top left corner inside to get a hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. From here, proceed all the way through the cave as we did once before until you emerge back on Route 3.

From here, go right and climb down the rocks nearby. Grab the hidden *Synthetic Seed* and enter the nearby cave. Here, you can get *TM53 Energy Ball*, a *Dragon Fang*, and a hidden *Full Restore*. Exit this cave.

### Climbin' in Tanzan Depths

Fly over to the Tanzan Cove and enter the main part of Tanzan Mountain. Go past the meteor base and down the stairs to enter the Tanzan Depths.

In the area where we fought Steelix, make your way to the top left and climb across the metal beam. Climb up here. You'll find a *Muscle Band*, *Rock Memory*, *Big Nugget*, and *Kangaskhanite* here as well as hidden items: *Escape Rope*, 4 *Tiny Mushrooms*, *Green Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Exp. Candy XL*, *Awakening*, *Blue Shard*, and *Carbos*.

Use Earthquake, Magnitude, etc. in a battle twice to make some green crystal gems fall - this is necessary to explore the other part of the Tanzan Depths.

Use an Escape Rope or Dig to save time if you'd like, and return to Tanzan Cove. Surf across the cove and enter the Tanzan Mountain entrance here. Climb down the rocks.

In the next room, you can find an *Exp. Candy XL* as well as a hidden *Super Repel*, *Escape Rope*, 2 *PokeSnax*, *Purple Shard*, *Stardust*, and *Great Ball*, as well as tons of mining rocks. Once you get everything, break the ground by using Magnitude or Earthquake twice in battle once more.

The floor will collapse, creating a new climbing wall. Head down. In the next room, talk to the Green Crystal to get Larvitar to move. You can get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Awakening* in here. Proceed to the next room.

Here is the first of the Larvitar puzzles. By knocking down the four green crystals, we can use them as directions that we want Larvitar to go. As long as there is a path in the specified direction (up, down, left, right) to a translucent rock, it will go there and remove it. I will provide routes in invisible text that remove the most rocks and allow you to get all items.

That's all we can do here, so escape from this cave.

### Climbin' in the Iolia Valley

Make your way to the east side of Route 1, then Rock Slide down into the Iolia Valley. Make your way to Luna's gym room. You can actually rock climb in here.

Do so, then use the purple crystal to grab a *Dark Material*. Exit the cave.

We should now have 3 Dark Materials - one is at the top of the waterfall in this valley, the other was in the locked room of the Sanctum. With all three in your bag as well as a Soul Candle, fly over to Lapis Ward and make your way down to the Subseven Sanctum.

Talk to the summoning table for a battle with **Deino**.

### Climbin' in the Mountains

Next, it's time to enter the three-mountain complex one more time for a few goodies. Fly over to the Route 1 Nature Center, grab a Tauros and make your way to the Celestinine Mountain B2F entrance via the North Aventurine Woods.

At the top of the ice puzzle, you'll see a climbing wall. Go up it, then surf to the left and push the nearby boulder to the left. Rock climb back down, this time making your way down the stairs to the left of the ice puzzle. Head up past the pushed boulder to get a *Life Orb*. Pokemon Showdown, here we come.

From here, our next destination is Ametrine Mountain 2F. You can either go through the mountain complex to get there or just fly to the Circus or Ametrine City and make your way there that way.

We've gone this path once before to get some items. Climb the waterfall in the northeast side of Ametrine Mountain 2F to reach 3F, then cross the ice north. Carefully go across the ice on the top left side to climb another fall to 4F. Once you reach 4F, save the game for in case you mess up, then beach at the top. You'll see a rock chilling in the middle of the ice puzzle towards the top left side. Drop down the ledge such that you'll be stopped by that rock, then go right and up into a climbable wall. Grab a hidden *Blue Shard* then go up to 5F.

Complete an ice puzzle here, grab a *Paralyze Heal*, then take the waterfall down. Not down one floor, not two, but down EIGHT floors, you'll land on Ametrine Mountain B4F.

Yay, another pseudo legendary now obtainable.

On this floor, you can also pick up the *Icium-Z* as well as a *Jolly Mint* and 4 *Exp. Candy XL*. You can also find a hidden *Burn Heal* and *Antidote* down here.

That's all we can do in here, so escape the mountains however you please.

## Upper Route 4

That wraps up all the optional rocks that we can climb, so fly on back to Calcenon and head east to where Hardy is on Route 4. Climb the rocks here.

Note that there are a lot of different encounter tables for the various maps of Route 4.

You can get a hidden *Max Repel*, *Red Shard*, and *Escape Rope* on this level. Towards the bottom left side, there is a climbing path that goes down and left. Climb down it.

This brings us back to the first map we were on, at a different point. Grab a hidden *Synthetic Seed* then climb up the rocks on the left. Grab the *Full Restore* and the hidden *Green Shard*.

Make your way back to the previous map and go up the slope towards the top. On this map, a chill will settle in the air.

Pick up the hidden *Super Potion*. As hinted at as we entered, we're going to need to transform the field. Battles are fought on the Mountain Field - to transform it into Snowy Mountain, you'll need to use Blizzard, Subzero Slammer via the Ice type Z crystal we got previously, or by letting Hail be on the field for 3 turns. Piloswine will be able to use Blizzard, so you can try to encounter one if you don't have these moves.

Once you do, snow will gather on the map.

On this map, you will find a hidden *Red-Hots*, *X Sp. Def*, *Magical Seed*, *Ice Gem*, *Salt-Water Taffy*, *Ice Heal*, and *Hyper Potion*. There are lots of paths we can go from here, and I will start by doing the rock climb path in the top left, accessible via surfing on the water. To reach the water, surf from the hop rock with the little stairs at the bottom.

On the next map you can find a hidden *PokeSnax* and an *Ice Stone*. Climb back down the hill.

This time, go around the rocks in the water to climb the waterfall at the top.

Grab a *Revive*. This is another map in which we'll need to transform Mountain to Snowy Mountain. Do so.

Once you succeed, climb the mountain. We'll land on a higher part of a map from earlier. Grab the hidden *Stardust* and enter the shed here.

Pick up *TM73 Thunder Wave*. Press 'A' while you're above the disconnected wires to connect them, prepare your team, then make your way to the top left corner for a fight.

This is a very tough fight with a custom, overpowered Breloom robot! With mixed attacks, the ability to put you to sleep, and a set up move, it can sweep. Wear it down with status conditions and stat debuffs to win!

Once you win, a **Gastly** will pop out of the robot. It will run around the robot to hide from you, but you can battle it by talking to it if you're quick enough. I recommend disabling speed up for this part.

Return to the area with the lake. This time, take the rock climbing path in the top right corner. Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* here.

As you're hinted to do, we'll need to transform the Snowy Mountain Field here into a Mountain. Many of the burning Fire type moves like Lava Plume and Fire Pledge will do the trick. You can also use a Fire type Z-move. Once the field is changed, you'll be sent to a new map. Use the hopping stones to enter the cave.

As in the previous map, it is hinted that we're gonna want to change the field, this time from Icy Field to Cave Field. Doing this will open the above water encounters as well as letting you grab the *Heracronite* and hidden *Focus Sash* in the pond.

This room also has a secret. From the pond, go clockwise around the ring. You'll be able to sneak behind a rock here. A counter-clockwise loop will lead to 3 hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. Follow the loop clockwise, until you see the shortcuts in the bottom walls to climb up further. Use these to reach the cave exit, but don't go out quite yet. From here, follow the outermost loop clockwise all the way around to get a hidden *Big Nugget*. Backtrack this loop, then exit the cave at the bottom.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* and *Nugget*. Talk to Bagon here and show it how to Fly... and it will do so, off the cliff. Backtrack through Charous Mountain all the way back to the map with the lake.

This time, make your way all the way to the bottom right corner of the map. Climb down here. Once more, burn the Snow on the Mountain away to uncover the *Lycanium-Z*. I think it's worth noting here that in Pokemon Reborn the exclusive Z-move Splintered Stormshards carries forward its canon effect of destroying Field Effects... including all of Reborn's custom ones. If you really find yourself in a rut of being unable to deal with an opponent's field synergy, it may be worth considering training a Lycanroc to remove it.

Climb back to the previous map, this time going down the rocks to the left.

You can find a hidden *Swift Wing*, *Big Pearl*, and *Chesto Berry*.

Use the rock wall in the bottom right corner to reach a new map. Grab the hidden *Escape Rope* here. Transform the field to Snowy Mountain and a new rock climb path will be created, so follow it up.

Pick up the *Ultra Potion* and hidden *Liechi Berry*, then melt the Snowy Mountain as we've done before. In exchange for a Revive, you'll be able to obtain our friend from earlier and the final pseudo-legendary: **Bagon**.

Head back two maps. This time, use the rock climb in the bottom-left corner to go down to another map with a large lake.

You can find a hidden *Elemental Seed*, *Ultra Ball*, *Moon Stone*, and *Rawst Berry* here. Surfing across the water to the little island, you can get a *Max Elixir* and a hidden *Heart Scale*.

Climb the rocks in the upper left corner to reach a new section of the first Upper Route 4 map we landed on, containing the *Mimikium-Z*. Let's snuggle forever. Return to the previous map.

That's it for Route 4 exploration and goodies, so talk to Hardy in the big open area on the left side of the area.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Take on Hardy's bet (+1 Hardy)

Enter the building, and look around with Hardy. Once he leaves, follow him outside and talk to him again. Move the metal plate. If you took on the bet you'll get $2000.

Up and to the right, you'll see a now-accessible ladder, and Absol. Don't we love it when Absol shows up? Head down the ladder...

## Glass Workstation

Talk to Hardy, then follow him into the elevator. Talk to Bennett.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say "To be stronger than anyone" (-1 Bennett)
- Say "To win Luna" (Neutral)
- Say "To make things different" (+2 Bennett)
- Say that you don't remember (+1 Bennett)

Once you wake up, climb up the ladder, and go left into the opening. Follow Glaceon down the path. You'll see one of its abilities: to bridge short gaps on the upper floor with its ice. Jump down to the bottom floor. There's a door towards the bottom here which contains a healing machine and PC.

This building is basically a big puzzle. Feel free to skip ahead if you'd rather solve it yourself.

Talk to Glaceon again to see another of its abilities: creating a path over lava. Confront the Meteor Grunt at the top, and he will run away. Thankfully there is another way in: down and to the left, you'll see a glass window! By now hopefully we should know what to do when we see glass.

Defeat the Team Meteor Grunt, and talk to the monitor in the corner to open the door. Glaceon will start to follow you. You can talk to it to heal status conditions on your team members for free. You can also choose whether to pet Glaceon or not, for the quest but also for points and a different battle later on. Pretty intense choice, I know.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Glaceon (+2 Lumi)
- Don't pet Glaceon (-3 Lumi)

Exit this room and make your way left. Use Glaceon's ability on the lava in both places, then make your way to the left. Glaceon can also create paths across sand, so do so here. Make your way to the top left side of the room and attempt to enter the small room towards the top. Defeat the grunt.

Talk to the monitor in the corner to open the door, then talk to Espeon's cage. We can't get it out of here quite yet, however.

Exit this room at the bottom. You'll notice another glass window to the right, which you can again smash your way into.

Defeat the grunt and pick up the *Timid Mint*, 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, and *PP All*. Exit this room.

There's nowhere else to go but up the ladder to the right. Unfortunately Glaceon can't follow you up the ladder, so keep that in mind. Anyways, follow this linear path into another room and defeat the Meteor.

Grab the *Cage Key*. Head all the way back, join back up with Glaceon, and free Espeon!

Espeon can use Future Sight, which shows a blurry image of our next objectives. Helpful if you get stuck... or you can just read on. Anyways, you can also choose to pet Espeon for the quest, and for points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Espeon (+1 Eve)
- Don't pet Espeon (-1 Eve)

You'll notice that Espeon and Glaceon won't both be able to follow you at the same time, so you'll need to position the one you don't wanna take with you in the right place. You'll see what I mean now: switch to Glaceon outside, then head to the left of the nearby pallet of glass. Talk to Glaceon, and tell it to stay where it is. Head back to get Espeon, who can use telekinesis to move glass. Back on the side where Glaceon is, move this glass pallet up by interacting with it, then pressing up.

From here, go right across the sand, then up at the first lava bridge. Move the glass at the top to the left, then smash your way into the nearby room via the window.

Defeat the two scientists here, then talk to the monitor at the top to unlock the elevator.

Back outside, move the right glass pallet down to save a bit of time later on. Make your way to the bottom right corner of this room and move the glass up to get the *Sablenite*. Move this pallet back down by going around.

Heading left, you'll see three pallets of glass close to each other. Before we move these, you're going to want to actually swap Espeon for Glaceon. Drop off Glaceon on the right side of these three pallets. Go pickup Espeon once more, and move the pallets respectively up, left, and down to open a path.

From here, swap back to Glaceon, then drop it off near the ladder in the bottom right. Head back up to grab Espeon, then make your way back to the ladder where Glaceon is. Move the nearby glass up, then enter the door to the right.

Grab the 2 *EV Boosters* then return to the main room and go left. Move the bottom-most of the three glass pallets back up so we can pass along the bottom. Switch to Glaceon and make a path over the ice in the bottom left. Switch back to Espeon.

Enter the bottom left room where we found the key. Move each of the five glass pallets left to reach *TM29 Psychic*! Exit this room. Cross the lava and move the nearby glass up. Go right from here, and move a glass pallet to the right to get the *Gyaradosite*!

Make your way to Glaceon, and reverse the steps we took to get both Pokemon to the bottom so that both Pokemon are now back towards the top. After clearing a path to the elevator in the top left corner, switch to Glaceon and head up to B1F.

From here, follow the path to the left, bridging gaps with ice. Enter the next room.

It's been a while since we've seen Aster on this route. This time he encorporates a few of Eclipse's Pokemon into his own team. As usual, he focuses on Rock and Ground types, with Passimian there to provide hard hitting coverage. His team is generally pretty fast and physical, so speed control and/or some physical tanks will probably be able to find success. If you can tank an Explosion from Solrock and set up, he has no priority moves to prevent a sweep. He'll give you the *Meteor Card*.

If you refused to give Blake the Ruby Ring, grab the *Meteor Card* at the top. You can also get 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Open the pods in this room.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Use Heal Bell on Noel (+1 Noel)

Take the elevator back to the bottom floor. Before we continue, take Glaceon into the elevator where Hardy is sleeping.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Use Heal Bell on Hardy twice (+1 Hardy)

Next, switch back to Espeon. Return to the room on the upper floor with the glass. Move the glass out of the way. Note that despite every pallet in the dungeon so far appearing to only move "along the grain", you'll need to push the bottom right one down to finish this puzzle. It's a bit odd but mess around with this puzzle a few times and you'll figure it out. Anyways, you'll get a *Reborn Ball*! This is Reborn's Master Ball.

Return to B2F, and switch to Glaceon. Move Glaceon up and to the left of the rightmost sand pit, then switch back to Espeon. From here, take Espeon to the top right, pushing the first and second glass pallets to the right. Head back and switch to Glaceon, then use it to make a path across lava in the top left. Grab the 5 *Exp. Candy XL*.

Position Glaceon exactly in this spot:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/glass_glaceon.jpg"/>

Next, pick up Espeon and stand directly under Glaceon. Move the two glass pallets out of the way, then deposit Espeon up and to the right in exactly this spot:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/glass_espeon.png"/>

Switch to Glaceon and make a bridge across the lava to the north. Switch back to Espeon and head up, moving two more pallets out of the way and revealing the Meteor Card scanner. Use it to open the door.

Undo the moves we did to reach the top right corner. Head to the top left corner and use Espeon to finally clear a path to the door. This is it for exploration. Prepare your team as best you can for the shenanigans to come, and enter the door at the top!

### The Glass Gauntlet

Now begins one of the most glorious parts of Reborn. I'll let each of the fights speak for itself.

This battle is our first 12v6! On average each of our Pokemon has to be knocking out 2 each in order to win this thing. While that is a fairly large disadvantage, there are lots of tactics we can use to come out on top in this fight: The best advice I can give for Reborns 12v6 doubles fights (there will be more) is that conserving momentum is extremely important. In this case, Cain and Shelly each have Pokemon all 7+ levels *under* the cap, and neither team is particularly suited to abuse this field effect in particular, so it's a good fight to ease into the 12v6 setup.

Shelly's entire team is weak to Rock Slide, so it's not a bad idea to operate from the doubles priniciple: "support your Rock Slider at all costs". Heat Wave is also pretty potent here for similar reasons - a sun team can devastate here. You can fairly easily opt for a speed control strategy of some sort - Magic Bouncing back the Sticky Web or embracing it and abusing 8 turn Trick Room are excellent choices. You can also use Factory Field to your advantage blah blah... you knew that by now. Optimize your team to the max cap, come with a strategy to conserve momentum, and you'll be able to find a way to come out on top.

Ok, so after finally overcoming a fight with all the odds stacked against you... surprise, a singles fight against a mystery trainer. You can't switch out your team at all but thankfully you do get a heal before this one.

Here's the thing. This fight, generally speaking, isn't gonna be the worst thing in the world. It's a 6v6 and your opponent has a mostly frail team plus Umbreon and sort of Gothitelle. If that's all there was to say, I'd assume you'd be able to find a way through this one and that would be that. The problem is: *any Pokemon that are fainted at the end of this fight stay fainted for the next*, basically as if you use Full Restores on all living Pokemon and nothing more. And for the next fight, you'll really want as many Pokemon as you can take.

So, with the goal of simply making sure that every one of your Pokemon stays alive? Weavile has a Focus Sash, meaning your lead for the whole gauntlet needs to be able to deal two hits of damage without dying (or switch). Mismagius is fast and if you make the mistake of letting it set up a Nasty Plot, there's a good chance it will claim a soul or two. Honchkrow is really nasty, with Sucker Punch allowing it to punish weakened Pokemon. Umbreon is annoyingly bulky, with Foul Play to hurt your physical attackers even more. Mega Absol is really strong, and you're usually going to find yourself in a kill or be killed scenario with it. Finally there is Gothitelle... who has Shadow Tag and Calm Mind. Meaning if there's any Pokemon on your team the AI has realized it can beat by switching in Gothitelle at any time... that Pokemon is as good as dead!

So now you see the challenge this seemingly simple 6v6 fight offers. If you think you can beat the next fight with 4-5 Pokemon alive, feel free to try if you are having a hard time with this one. There are some general tips I recommend to make it through this one with minimal casualties, however. For Weavile, Fake Out, multi-hit moves, and Sandstorm are all viable ways to break the sash, so setting up your gauntlet team with one of these first in your party will probably help. Honchkrow likes to come in on a weakened Pokemon, so try to anticipate Sucker Punch and either switch or set up further if you can. Keep in mind if you're faster than Honchkrow, other priority moves like Quick Attack will go before Sucker Punch. Make sure you're always ready for a Gothitelle switch in, or maybe learn exactly when the AI will try to switch it in so you can pivot to something that can knock it out. Speed control, either by superior stats, Tailwind, Trick Room, etc., will then be key to one-shotting Mismagius and Absol before they can get you. If you are able to 2HKO Umbreon, it won't be able to heal itself, so making sure you have either a physical attacker that can live some Foul Plays or a really strong special attacker are key. Even though you already have to plan for other fights with your team... keeping these tips in mind will help you overcome this obstacle, hopefully.

Even after making it through the previous two battles, you're thrusted into a third, and surprise, its another 12v6. While opponent levels are indeed a bit lower, without being able to change your team after the previous two fights and the aforementioned faint follow-through, you might even be stuck doing this fight as a 12v4 or 12v5. The good news here is that almost everything in this fight is a frail Ice or Psychic type. The real exceptions here are Bronzong and Metagross, both of which are extremely bulky and can hit really hard on this field, Clefable, who likes to spread Paralysis as a lead, and Bisharp, who can keep up the pressure with Sucker Punch and has enough bulk to live a good chunk of even super effective moves. Ninetales' hail and Aurora Veil are, as always, very beneficial to their team, as is the 8-turn Psychic Terrain Alakazam will try to get off. Really seems like there are lots of threats and not enough Pokemon to cover them all.

Otherwise there's not really a ton I can say: spam 'D' to drop a save before this fight and just play it out as many times as it takes for you to realize where the threats to your team are, and how you can overcome them. Conserving momentum is key as before, Trick Room as always is very potent, and weather and/or the field can help you steamroll. Using Snatch or Brick Break to mess with Aurora Veil, changing the weather, etc. are good options. Even if you have dropped a save mid-gauntlet, don't be afraid to throw away some money (or load a backup save) to better prepare for the gauntlet.

Once you win this battle, you'll find yourself in an area simply called "???".

## Inside The Void

This area is fairly straightforward, as whatever branching paths there are don't really lead anywhere. It's a very story-centric area, so if you are digging the story, talk to every NPC you can and pay attention to your surroundings as you make your way through the void.

When you reach a table full of starters, talk to the position corresponding to the starter you picked when starting the game.

Later on, you'll pass Aya's segment. You can optionally talk to Cain for a third time.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Cain in The Void after Aya's section (+1 Cain)

After seeing Luna and Taka on the left side, a voice will talk to you. Prepare your team before going up, as there's a fight coming up!

The only way it's healing itself is with Dream Eater, so a Dark type can slowly whittle it down. With a 4X weakness to bug and a weakness to field-boosted Fairy moves, there's a good chance you'll have something to deal with it. You can also stall with Toxic! Chesto Berries, Safeguard, Sleep Talk, etc. can all help you deal with its 100% accurate Hypnosis as well. 

Keep following the path, and you'll eventually exit the Void. After another massive conversation, accept the fast travel request to get the heck out of the Glass Workstation.

## The Raid on Agate City

Back in Calcenon City, talk to Shelly towards the right side of the map. Enter the "story building" in Calcenon for some points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly while she is talking to Titania/Serra (+1 Shelly)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reshiram Route only: Talk to Titania while she is talking to Shelly (+1 Titania)
- Zekrom Route only: Talk to Serra while she is talking to Shelly (+1 Serra)

Talk to Eve near the Pokemon Center.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Eve and learn about all the PULSEs remaining (+1 Eve)

Enter the "story building" once more. The squad will leave for Agate City, so fly over to Vanhanen Labyrinth and enter Agate City from the south once more.

A note:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reshiram Route only: Talk to Titania while doing the Agate raid (-1 Titania)

Defeat the grunts as you progress upwards.

This fight is a 12v10, with Hardy on your side. Shouldn't be too crazy with his help, just know that whatever team you prepare for the following battle is what you'll be stuck with for this one.

After all this time, we finally get to fight Meteor's Leader Solaris, one-on-one. No field effects are in play this fight: it's just the raw power of basically a Gen 7 OU team versus yours. Staraptor with Intimidate that hits hard? Yep. Technician Scizor with ridiculously strong Bullet Punch? Yep. Dragon Dance Gyarados? Yep. Tyranitar and Excadrill sand core? It's there! And on top of all that is his Mega Garchomp. That is not a typo above: it really does have max EVs in every stat, thanks to its PULSE 2. Get used to these for the end game. Essentially what this means is Garchomp will hit hard but also be bulky enough to live a couple of attacks.

At this point you also have a lot of mega Pokemon and Z-moves to your name. In particular, I find that the Icium-Z can often ensure a kill on Garchomp if you need. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a single special attack on his team... so you can focus your team entirely on physical defense. Some fast (or slow under Trick Room) special attackers running Fire, Ice, and Electric moves will be able to get 5 out of 6 of his party members super-effectively... leaving Tyranitar an excellent candidate for a Close Combat or something. I believe in your ability to defeat this guy!

Make your way to the right.

Climb the first waterfall and grab the hidden *Stardust*. After climbing the second waterfall, head to the left. You'll find a hidden *Quick Ball*. Go down the waterfall and dive down.

You can find a hidden *Silk Scarf*, 2 *Potions*, *Ether*, *Quick Claw*, *Poke Ball*, and *Ultra Ball*. If you surface on the right side of the area, you can climb some waterfalls to get the *Pinsirite*. Back underwater, enter the cave at the top.

In the next room, Lin will flex on us. Grab the hidden *Super Potion* and *Lucky Egg*, then backtrack to the main part of the city. To the east of the Pokemon Center, watch the scenes play out then talk to Shelly. Hardy will then extend an offer to challenge his gym!

## Agate City

We could accept Hardy's gym battle offer right away, but there are some sidequests with excellent rewards now open: to cut to the chase, we can actually get every single non-legendary Pokemon before fighting Hardy - and if we do get them all, there's a really awesome reward waiting for us. So, let's get into it.

Head to the left side of Agate City and into the Agate Circus.

Relationship Point Choices:
- (Refuse Blake Route Only) Talk to Ciel on the top left side of the circus after the raid (+1 Ciel, +1 Ace)
- (Give Ruby Ring Route Only) Talk to Samson in the Big Top after the raid (+1 Samson)

Back in Agate City, starting at the Pokemon Center, head straight to the left and enter the house here. Talk to the Hiker inside, who will leave for Route 4. We'll follow him later. Outside, grab a hidden *Purple Shard* above then enter the top building. If you previously joined the Magma Gang, you have the opportunity to do an in-game trade here: your Basculin for **Litten**.

Back at the Pokemon Center, this time go east. Talk to the lady in the house here to begin another quest, which we'll complete in a bit.

We'll come back to the next house up and to the right in a bit. Enter the apartment complex beyond, next to the rock climb. In the lobby, if you previously joined the Aqua Gang, you will have the opportunity to complete an in-game trade: your Oranguru for **Oshawott**.

Head up from here. Near the gym, you'll find a hidden *Everstone*. Back down and to the right, climb up the rocks in the northeast side of the city, and follow the path. Grab a hidden *Ability Capsule* as you scale waterfalls.

## Route 4 Sidequests

By climbing the top waterfall, you'll emerge in a new area of Route 4.

Grab the *Ground Memory* as well as the hidden *Health Wing* and *X Sp. Def*. Climbing the waterfall at the top will return us to a map we had previously visited.

From here, make your way to the other map with the lake - you'll need to climb up a couple of rocks. In the southwest corner of the higher lake, you'll see the Hiker from Agate City. Talk to him for a battle.

Once you defeat him, he will let his Pokemon out to hang out on the map. Talk to the Hiker for 5 *PokeSnax*. Talk to him again. He'll ask if you have a spare belt in your bag. By giving a Black Belt, you'll get a *Fist Plate*. If you don't have any Black Belts in your bag but you do have an Expert Belt, you can trade it for a *Life Orb*. Note that we will be able to get more Expert Belts in a bit, so don't feel bad about trading it away if you'd like.

Once you've done these things, give snax to the Pokemon. Specifically, give a snax to Altaria, then another to Golem. By doing so, a new rock path will open up, so climb down to reach a new area.

Grab the *Sceptilite* and *Big Nugget*. Hidden here is a *Blue Shard* and an *Ultra Potion*. That's it for Route 4 for now!

## Magic Square Quest

Fly over to North Obsidia Ward next. North of the Spyce, enter the open door into the building where we once fought ZEL and Magnezone. Talk to the monitor in the first room, and use your Meteor Card on it. Talk to the now-open shafts behind to jump down.

In a room to the right, you can get an *EV Tuner* and 5 *Exp. Candy XL*. You can also read the book to the right to get some lore (including Sirius' real name LOL).

Back in the main room, time for one of the community's most dreaded puzzles. Talk to the monitor at the bottom to learn of our quest. We'll need to make it so both 3x3 squares are magic squares, that is, all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number: 15. Additionally, only the middle square can be the same across the two squares.

There are essentially two parts to this quest: figuring out what numbers you want where, and actually moving them into place. It's also worth noting that for some reason whether or not Saphira was kidnapped back in Belrose actually affects the starting positions of the numbers, but my solving method actually works for both versions.

### What Goes Where?

I actually graduated with a degree in Mathematics once upon a time and do Computer Science-adjacent stuff for a living. So I'm gonna nerd out for a little while. Skip ahead a bit if you just want to see what the solution looks like. :)

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_0.jpg"/>

First we are going to solve for what we are looking for. It can be proven fairly easily that the middle is 5. Here's why:

Notice that from the middle row: B1 + B2 + B3 = 15, and from the diagonals that A1 + B2 + C3 = 15, and C1 + B2 + A3 = 15. Adding these three equations and moving things around a bit, we see (A1 + B1 + C1) + (A3 + B3 + C3) + 3 * B2 = 45.

We also can observe from the first and third column that A1 + B1 + C1 = 15 and A3 + B3 + C3 = 15. Thus simplifying the above result leads to 3 * B2 = 15, so B2 is 5.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_1.jpg"/>

I'll solve for just one magic square for now.

We might as well try putting 1 in a corner and seeing what happens. Since we can just rotate the square, without loss of generality we can see what happens when we place it in the top left corner of one of the magic squares and seeing if a contradiction arises. This will also force 9 to be in the opposite corner to keep with the 15 sum rule.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_2.jpg"/>

Consider the highlighted tiles. Each cannot be 1, 5, 9 since each is used, so it must be inclusively between 2 and 4, or inclusively between 6 and 8. If the tile is at most 4, then the remaining tile in the row with 1 would have to be at least 10, which is impossible. If the tile is at least 6, the column with 9 would be too large. So there is no possible value that works in either highlighted tile, meaning that putting 1 in the corner leads to no solutions. Therefore, we can assume 1 is in one of the four tiles adjacent to the middle, making 9 appear opposite. Again without loss of generality due to rotations, I'll put 1 on the left.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_3.jpg"/>

The column containing 1 has two empty tiles that will add up to 14, meaning the only possibility with the remaining numbers is for them to be 6 and 8 (as 2, 3, 4 are too small, and we can't use 7 twice). Since we can simply reflect our square across the horizontal line through the center, again there is no loss to generality to put 6 on top, and 8 below. Solving the diagonals puts 4 in the bottom right and 2 in the top right. Then all we have to do is put 3 and 7 into the final cells, which leaves us with one completed square.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_4.jpg"/>

You can check that each row, column, and diagonal add up to 15 if you don't believe me. The final stipulation of this puzzle is that only the center can be the same across puzzles. To deal with this issue, I simply rotate the puzzle by 90 degrees: obviously the rows, columns, and diagonals all still add up to 15, but now each non-5 piece is in a different place.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_5.jpg"/>

This is the solution we will solve for. Due to rotations and reflections as mentioned before, one or both of your squares may look different from mine.

### Moving Pieces Into Place

Now, we just have to execute. Some players seem to be driven kinda mad by this step, but I am here to tell you about an algorithm with a handy invariant that guarantees we can complete the puzzle pretty easily! Essentially, we will solve piece by piece: by column, then by row. In fact, we can guarantee that we will be able to solve the first five columns in this way without messing up anything that came before!

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_6.jpg"/>

Suppose we are solving for the highlighted tile on the left (the *destination*), and we need to move 5 in (the *target*). Note that the tiles in all the columns to the left (just column 1) have already been solved, and the tiles above our target as well (here, just column 2, row 1). We intend to keep the puzzle this way after putting the next tile into position. So, here's the algorithm:

- If the target is in the same column as the destination, we can do a few things.
    - If the destination is the top tile, simply move the column until the target is at the destination, then we are done.
    - If you the destination is the bottom tile, then the tile will already be correct, so we are done.
    - Otherwise, the destination will be in the middle, and the target will be in the bottom row. Simply move the bottom row right, the column now containing the target up, then reset the bottom row by moving it back left once.

- If the target is in the same row as the destination, move the column containing the target up once so that it is no longer in the same row.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_7.jpg"/>

- Move the row containing the destination right as many times as it takes for the destination tile to be directly above/below the target.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_8.jpg"/>

- Move the column containing the target up or down so that the target is now in the correct row.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_9.jpg"/>

- Now, simply move the row containing the target back to the left until it is once more solved. You'll notice that if you did the steps right, it will leave all the previously solved pieces the same, and put the new piece into the correct spot.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_10.jpg"/>

Next, you'd move a 3 into the destination below the 5 we just moved in, then the 2 into the destination: top tile of the next column, and so on. That's really all there is to moving pieces in the first five columns into place. Do so, and your puzzle will look something like this:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_11.jpg"/>

In my case, the dashes will represent 2, 6, and 7. Moving the rightmost column up or down if necessary to put the correct number into the top right, either this will solve the puzzle right away, or it will have the other two numbers switched around. If this occurs, essentially it means that you put the wrong number into the left side puzzle. Your board should look somewhat like this in this case:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/magic_square_12.jpg"/>

There is a simple fix however: switch 6's. Simply move the right column up, the first row left, the right column down, and the first row right again. Finally, move the right column down once again.

Anyways, once you complete the puzzle, the *Darkinium-Z*, the *Gardevoirite*, and *TM24 Thunderbolt* will drop down. Very nice. You'll also notice that the screen has changed a bit: one number per column is now white.

Head on back to Agate City, and enter the building to the right of the Pokemon Center. Talk to the lady and give her the code in white we just found: 139749.

In the next room, you can get the *Manectite* as well as *Department Store Sticker: Manectric*. Hallelujah. You know what that means!

This is actually a somewhat tough team, with Mega-Steelix in the back as well! Nothing you can't handle, though. She'll leave, talking about Caroline's basement. This next part of the quest is pretty obscure.

Fly over to Agate City, and enter the building below the gym. There is a child in the bottom right (who kinda blends in with the chair?!) who will let you access the basement. Pay very close attention to the tiles in this basement, then fly back to Calcenon City.

Enter Charlotte's gym, and make your way to the back. I actually mentioned this before in the guide, since you can open the secret door at any time, and doing so earlier allows us access to an extra Charlotte point and an early Mega Stone. If you didn't open the door then, we need to make the tiles in the back section of Charlotte's gym match the tile layout in the random Agate basement. It should look like this when you're done:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/calcsecret.jpg"/>

Follow the path from here and grab the *Charizardite X* if you didn't get it earlier. Give Murmina the Family Picture we once yoinked from a shelf in the Belrose Manse. She'll gift us a **Torchic** egg. Very nice.

## Bee's Pokedex Completion Quest (Part 1)

Fly back to Agate City, this time heading into the small house towards the right side of the city. The girl inside is named Bee, and she'll basically offer us rewards for every 100 Pokemon we've added to our Pokedex. At the point in my playthrough I was playing parallel to this guide, I had 569 Pokemon. Your mileage will certainly vary depending on what evolutions you've done, which Pokemon you've bred, etc., but I think it is a safe assumption that if you've been following along closely, you'll have at least 500 Pokemon at this time. So, you'll get the following rewards:

|Pokemon Caught |Reward         |
|---------------|---------------|
|100+           |*Galladite*    |
|200+           |**Froakie**    |
|300+           |*TM13 Ice Beam*|
|400+           |*Scizorite*    |
|500+           |*Electrium-Z*  |

Clearly some excellent rewards in here, and we're not even done with the quest.

## Starter Egg Quest Part 3

Did you notice? After obtaining Froakie, we actually now have obtained all 21 starters! Breed whichever of Oshawott and Litten that is newer, as well as Snivy, Torchic, and Froakie, donating all four eggs to Kamaya in the Grand Hall.

For reaching 18 eggs donated, you'll be given the *Reset Disc- SPEED*. The rewards for donating all 21 are even better: you'll get *TM26 Earthquake*, *Psychium-Z*, and *Garchompite*.

## Completing the Pokedex (Minus Most Legendaries)

Even better: did you notice? After obtaining Froakie, we actually now have obtained at least one member of every single non-legendary evolution line in the game, plus Type:Null and Phione. This also means that we actually can carry out the rest of Bee's quest right now, before we even get the last two badges! That also means that we're going to have to do a lot of evolving and breeding... so if you don't care enough about these rewards, or would rather do the quest later, you can skip this part.

The following is a table of Pokemon you'll need to breed or evolve at this point in order to complete the Pokedex:

|Pokemon to Obtain  | Method                                            |

|**Golem-Alola**    |Evolve Graveler-Alola via Link Stone               |

Note that the Alolan forms don't count towards the overall completion of your Pokedex. The magic number for a completed Pokedex is **731** obtained.

## Bee's Pokedex Completion Quest (Part 2)

Fly back over to Agate City once you've gotten all 731 Pokemon so far. Talk to Bee once more.

|Pokemon Caught |Reward         |
|---------------|---------------|
|600+           |*Groundium-Z*  |
|700+           |*Blazikenite*  |
|731            |**Poipole**    |

Hell yes. One of the best Ultra Beasts is ours, before the last two gyms!

Use the move relearner or tutor to teach it Dragon Pulse and give it a level, and it will evolve into **Naganadel**.

## Geode Badge

Well, not much else to do for now than to finally take on the seventeenth gym leader.

Enter the Agate City gym and defeat the three trainers on the right side.

Talk to the guy in the top left corner for a guide to the gym. The guy here will play a musical riff that we are supposed to change the blocks on the right to match musically.

If you talk to the guy again and say "Help", he'll battle us, then tell us what to play.

This might be the "simplest" gym fight yet: Boosted Rock Slide spam! On Rocky Field, it adds extra damage when it flinches you. His team minus Gigalith are all fast and hard-hitting Rock types that all have this move, many above the level cap. That's really all there is to say about him: you'll be hit hard, fast, and likely flinch a lot.

If you are able to dispense with Gigalith, a slow team can steamroll his frail Pokemon under Trick Room. You can also take advantage of the move Wide Guard to prevent Rock Slide spam. Your own Rock Slide spam will also be reasonably effective here as his team doesn't resist Rock.

When you win, you'll get the Geode Badge, which boosts our level cap up to 95. You'll also get *TM80 Rock Slide*. Sweet.

# Episode 19: Pokemon Reborn

Ok, there is no official episode title for the final chapter of the main game, so I defer to the classic: simply giving it the name of the game.

Anyways, exit Hardy's gym.

First, a new default mart inventory update:

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shop: Default Mart (17 Badges)</strong></th></thead>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Max Potion</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$2500</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

Now that we've defeated Hardy, there is one final move tutor in Peridot Ward's Mosswater Market:

<div class="tutor_table"><table>
<thead><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mosswater Market Move Tutor: Elder</strong></th></thead>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Blast Burn</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">3 Red Shards</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Draco Meteor</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center">9 Red Shards</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

## Labradorra City

Fly over to Calcenon City. Talk to Hardy on the west side of the city.

**Relationship Point Choices:**

**Relationship Point Choices:**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Charlotte in the story apartment, answering "Yes" (+1 Saphira, -1 Laura)
- Talk to Charlotte in the story apartment, answering "No" (+1 Laura, -1 Saphira)

Grab the hidden *Health Wing*, *Potion*, and *Nugget* here. Prepare yourself for the first battle of this chapter... I wiped here on my first time! So did apparently many of the other beta testers, so don't feel too bad.

This battle hopefully makes it apparent how threatening the endgame full of PULSE2 will be. Even though Kenan is just a generic Meteor Ace, expect to see fights like this going forward.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* and continue.

Defeat the next Meteor Ace and head up to watch the scene. Before we continue, head back up to the Pokemon Center. Up and to the right is a path to a hidden *Max Repel* and a now-opened building. Talking to Noel inside will get you the *PULSE Readout 10*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Get the PULSE 10 Notes before defeating this PULSE (+1 Eve)

In the bottom left side of the city, a newly-opened path will lead to a building. Inside is a double battle with Victoria as a partner.

No field to worry about this time, just a fantastically put together mono-dark team of five with a PULSE monstrosity hiding in the back. Defeating Luna in the Glass Gauntlet should be adequate preparation for Zero's Pokemon: by now the core of Honchkrow, Weavile, and Umbreon should be familiar. Abusing Sucker Punch timing or faster priority to prevent a Honchkrow sweep, surviving a Weavile Ice Shard to kill it with something faster, and using a bulky Steel type to counter Umbreon are good places to start with these. Spiritomb plays a similar role to Umbreon, being bulky and punishing your physical attackers, but isn't too intense and can't do much to your own physical walls. Houndoom has a sash and likes to set up but isn't too bulky, meaning you can dent it then knock it out with some priority if you are able.

PULSE Clawitzer makes this fight a bit harder - he'll always send it out last. Although you may have a Pokemon able to withstand one base 120 Special-based attack, one use of any of three of its attacks will double its special attack thanks to Contrary. Another boost will basically allow it to eradicate any Pokemon you have. With its 252 base speed, you will not be able to outspeed it under normal circumstances at all, so it basically steamrolls most teams pretty easily. Therefore, the key to defeating Clawitzer is by taking advantage of the turns you have beforehand fighting Zero's other Pokemon to proactively put yourself into a winning condition. The obvious one you may think of by now is Trick Room - even if you're trading blow for blow, two or three really strong Dragon or Fairy type attacks will be able to knock it out, and you're basically guaranteed to go first in Trick Room, thanks to Clawitzer's insane speed stat. You can also take advantage of the first turn it is out, before it has any boosts, to suppress or change its ability: thereafter all of its moves except Origin Pulse will actually harm it, instead of helping it. Sturdy or Sash + Mirror Coat on a Pokemon with lots of HP may work too, just keep in mind it does have 252 base and max EV's in HP.

Once you defeat Zero, make your way back through the previous building. You'll notice some of the screens on the walls have changed, so keep in mind what they indicate. There are two secret numbers here: one is obvious, the other, not quite as much.

Back outside, talk to Taka and Solaris down from here if you are on Zekrom Route if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- On Zekrom Route only, talk to Taka and Solaris after PULSE Clawitzer (+2 Taka)

Anyways, head to the center of the city next. After this scene, head to the bottom-left side of the city. A path to a building at the bottom will now be open. Grab the hidden *Dire Hit* and head in. Talk to Eve in here to get some information about the next PULSE battle we'll be doing if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Eve about the upcoming PULSE battle (+1 Eve)

## Scarborough Quest

Before continuing, we can actually do one more quick quest. If you don't want to break up the current pace of the Labradorra siege you can come back to this quest, but I recommend it for some potentially helpful rewards for the next fight. Head to the building in the bottom-right side of Labradorra. Inside is a screen that we can use to enter passwords (we found these earlier). The first password is:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    2368
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the first password</a>
</div>

As a reward for inputting it, we can get the *Swampertite*! Very nice tool for a rain team. The second, harder to spot password is:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    3862
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the second password</a>
</div>

For inputting this one, we'll get a Sylveon, holding a *Ribbon Collar*.

Fly over to Jasper Ward and enter the second apartment from the left, on the bottom street. Talk to the attendant here to get access to the above floors. Head all the way to the top floor to get the *Fairium-Z*. Back down on the second floor, enter Apt. 2 and talk to the Gardevoir. Next, give the ribbon collar to Lottie to get the final one: *Department Store Sticker: Eevee*! Quite a sad story but hey, a nice reward.

There is also a person up here who will max out a Pokemon's friendship for $5000, which is nice.

In exchange for a Fresh Water, Soda Pop, and Lemonade, a child here will give you *TM25 Thunder*, *TM14 Blizzard*, and *TM38 Fire Blast*. Sweet.

In the bottom right side of the penthouse, there's a poor employee forced to battle us with a team of six Blissey, and you'll also get 20 *Exp. Candy XL* for each victory. You'll never need to grind anywhere else!

## LCCC Second Visit

With that quest out of the way, fly on back to Labradorra City. Make your way to a building in the bottom left corner, where you will have a brief chat with Lin. Inside the building, climb down the ladder to enter the LCCC once more.

At the first fork, head up to get a hidden *Elixir* and 7 *Fairy Gems*. Back down from here, go down once you reach the next fork. Along this path you can get a hidden *Revive*, *Max Repel*, and *HP Up*. Talk to the computer here with a Data Chip in your bag to turn it on. Back in the area with the Fairy Gems, talk to the now-lit computer screen to open a door.

Back in the main hallway, proceed to the right until you come to a four-way junction. Up from here is a hidden *Oran Berry*. Follow the path down from here. By talking to the computer screens here we can follow this path into the Calcenon side of the LCCC. Up the ladder, grab the *Charizardite Y* and open a shortcut to Calcenon City.

Head back down to the LCCC, this time, going right at the four-way junction. Grab the hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Friend Ball* along the path, and prepare before proceeding. Time for yet another PULSE fight...

What a gut punch on a first playthrough - both in battle, and just in general! Ok, so the good news is: once the PULSE is dead, then you'll be able to 2v1 Sigmund's team. The bad news is, well, as you can see there are quite a lot of shenanigans going on here! The obvious one is that Mr. Mime has Wonder Guard and is Dark/Ghost type. Thankfully we're not in Gen 5 anymore and this means it's weak to Fairy type moves, but just that one type - everything else will clink off of him like an Iron Sword on an Armor Knight. On top of this, it has very high defensive stats and a healing move, meaning even if you are using Fairy-moves they may not be able to easily do the job. What's more: it also has Entrainment, and will almost always use it on Sigmund's ally Pokemon when it gets a chance, meaning Aromatisse and potentially more Pokemon will also get immunity from most moves. Although Mime has no attack power of its own, it just uses Instruct, granting Sigmund's Pokemon two uses total of his various field-boosted Electric, Ghost, and Fairy moves, so you'll likely be worn down and unable to really do anything against either Pokemon on the first attempt!

In my opinion, your first priority should be taking out the PULSE at all costs. Aromatisse does hit fairly hard, but a couple Pokemon with some special bulk should be able to stick around for a few turns to help you accomplish a win condition. The next issue is actually killing Mime. You can opt for some kind of set-up move or Fake Tears / Screech + Moonblast / Play Rough or similar strategies potentially, and may be able to outpace its healing capacities and bring it down. With the Fairy Gems we picked up and more notably the Fairy Z-Crystal, you can boost these attacks to get extra damage out of them that may do the trick. It is also susceptible to status and weather, so I recommend using Toxic on Mime during the first turn, and Aromatisse the second. Keep a sizable chunk of your team alive from here, and you'll eventually watch both of your opponents perish, then you can focus on taking out the rest of Sigmund's team. Mega Alakazam is particularly threatening as are Raichu and Electivire if you're unprepared for them.

Once you defeat this harrowing PULSE fight, exit the LCCC back into Labradorra. In the house where we previously talked to Eve, you can get the just-a-bit-too-late *PULSE Readout 9*.

Enter the building up and right from the LCCC, where we previously saw Sigmund run away from us. On the ground is a sparkling object, the *Orphanage Key*!

Flying over to the Lapis Ward, you can now access the Orphanage once again. Making your way to the top, you'll find the *Alakazite*.

## Labradorra Tournament of Booty

Make preparations for a sequence of battles, noting that you won't be able to leave during. Fly back to Labradorra once you're ready, and enter the large building at the top-left side of the city.

After a scene explaining what we're in for, well, I just hope you're ready. Note that you can buy vending machine drinks and Common Candies here if you need to. Talk to folks around the lobby if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices**
- Tell Victoria you think the tournament is wrong (+1 Victoria)
- Tell Victoria you think the tournament is not wrong (-1 Victoria)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Titania again, after she tells you to leave her alone (-1 Titania)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Noel in the lobby (+1 Noel)

Enter your open door, prepare your team, then head in for our first fight. Your partner will be Cal on Reshiram Route or Florinia in Zekrom Route.

This is likely your first fight on the Inverse Field - a very straightforward field with two main effects: one, that the Magical Seed will boost all five stats and make you recharge, and two, that the type chart is inverted, explaining some of the weirder moveset choices on your opponents. Take care to think ahead in this fight about inverse type matchups, using TMs on your team if necessary to change up your movesets. Consider abusing the seed yourself if you're having a tough time.

Once you succeed, follow the path to the next area.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- On Reshiram Route only, talk to Cal, when the player is male (+1 Cal)

Prepare and head in to the next fight. The following two fights are fought in a different order depending on your route. Anyways:

If you're on Reshiram fight, this will be the first battle, on Zekrom, the second.

For our next fight with our pal Cal we get another glimpse at the Dragon's Den field, which boosts his Fire and Dragon moves and weakens your Water and Ice moves. You can still use Rock and Ground type moves to deal with his Fire types, just be careful of a Kommo-o setup and Mega Medicham.

If you're on Zekrom route, you'll get this fight next, and on Reshiram route you'll get it second:

Ah, the Glitch Field makes a return. Grass and Ground types generally have pretty good synergy with this field, and again you'll see familiar strategies here like Synthetic Seed bulk and Amnesia + Leaf Storm to ignore drops. Ferrothorn and Cradily can actually use their Special Defense as an attacking stat, so be cautious of those things. As with the Terra fight, curate a team specifically for success on Glitch, and you should be able to find a way through this one.

Once you've finished both fights, make your way further into the tournament, where Saphira's gym will become open!

## Treasure Badge

Enter Saphira's gym to the left, and talk to her in the corner. Next, familiarize yourself with the gym layout, and get the hidden *Quick Ball* and *Heart Scale* within. Proceed to the top of the area and talk to the chest.

**Relationship Point Choices:**

This conversation has tons of branches, so I made a flowchart. Note that all points here are for or against Saphira.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/saphira_points.jpg"/>

Next, you'll have to defend the chest against a barrage of Pokemon and Knight trainers. Between battles, you'll have time to open your bag and heal, so keep your PP and HP fresh so that you can successfully win every battle. As far as strategy to protect the chest, I recommend staying close to the chest at all times, and engaging foes as they come near you. In particular, watch out for Blaziken, who will appear almost out of nowhere from the bottom, and Zoroark, who sneaks in from the top. Some Pokemon will fly, and some will run at you. The Knights are slow, but have 3 Pokemon apiece, so make sure you are able to defeat them. Also, save often!

This guy is bulkier than normal: the 3252 EV's in HP is not a typo. A move like Endeavor can help solve that problem if you are really stuck here. Alternatively, Subzero Slammer transforms the field into Cave, where you can use Earthquake twice to end the fight.

Once you beat it, the path to Saphira will open. Time for our eighteenth and final gym battle!

Saphira's team doesn't pull punches: six of the best Dragon types in the game all boosted by the field effect. The Dragon Dances have double effectiveness, the Fire and Dragon moves have their effects doubled, and Noivern's seed boosts its Special Attack and gives it extra strong Flamethrower. On the defensive side, Dragonite's Multiscale takes away its Dragon weakness and all six of her Pokemon have 1.3x defense, on top of weakening your Ice moves. Two Sashes and Multiscale also make it near-impossible to one shot her Pokemon, as well. Garchomp will outspeed your team thanks to its Sash, and not a single Pokemon is a slacker that will let you easily set up on it.

Since Dragon is super effective against Dragon, you can also take advantage of the field and try to beat her with your own Dragon types. A single Dragon Dance boost can often turn one of your Pokemon into a sweeper, and with the help of one layer of Stealth Rocks, Multiscale and Sashes will be broken, allowing you a clean sweep. Trick Room is helpful as always, as her Dragons are all pretty fast, so a slower Pokemon with Dragon moves could be the trick. You can also change the field to cave to wear her down with Rock moves, if you'd prefer.

Once you win, head down to the chest to get the *Treasure Badge* and *TM02 Dragon Claw*! That makes 18 badges and all 100 (+9) TMs. The cap also becomes Lv. 100!

## Escaping the Tournament

Talk to Florinia back in the lobby, in the top right corner. After a long scene, Terra will delete your fonts.

First of all... the fonts are gone! Better hope you know which moveslot contains which move. Anyways, its the return of Terra's epic meme team, this time unshackled by the mono-ground restriction. Her Excadrill, Quagsire and Garchomp work as before basically. Chansey actually can attack on Glitch Field, and Porygon-Z likes to get an omniboost with its Z-Conversion. Then you have FEAR Donphan cleverly hiding its level behind the lack of fonts. 

Once you beat M3G4 T3RR4 once more, exit the tournament building via the path in the top left.

Some routes have a scene that plays here. Either way, you can now pet Sylveon for the quest. In fact, this is the last of the Eeveelutions, so if you've pet all of them so far, you can fly over to Spinel Town and talk to a girl in the right apartment building to get a *Choice Scarf* and the password *eeveeplease*.

Fly back to Victory Road. Inside the Pokemon Center, talk to an NPC who will send us on a quest. He'll give us the *Spirit Tracker*.

Before we enter Victory Road, there's actually one more tutor that we now have access to. Fly over to the Grand Hall and talk to the guy to your right.

<div class="tutor_table"><table>

Fun fact: this NPC was put in the game in honor of forum user LykosHand, who frequently wishes users a happy birthday! I have probably received 5 or 6 of these messages to date; they always make me celebrate. Thanks, Lykos.

### Logic Puzzle 1

In the first room, you can get a hidden *Hyper Potion*, *HP Up*, and *Big Nugget*.

Enter the next room at the top. You'll notice a flashing sound and animation when you walk in this room - this indicates that there are still spirits on this map that we can fight. We will do the spirit fighting itself in a bit.

Head up the stairs to the right and pick up the hidden *Protein*. Talk to the map at the top of the hill to get a sneak peek on what, and who, awaits us on the right side of the room. When you're ready, push the nearby boulder onto the pressure pad. Head down the stairs, dodging Blake's Icicle Crash attacks as you go, then head to the top left of the room. Talk to the map here for another sneak peek at the rest of this large room, then enter the next room at the top.

Around the outsides of this room, you can find a hidden *Ice Gem* and *Blue Shard*. By sneaking around the bottom side of the room, you'll find the first of the spirits, who we can optionally fight. I won't post detailed strategy notes for these fights: use your knowledge of the fields and the Pokemon in your roster to grasp victory!

Defeating these spirits as we find them will allow us to obtain some decent rewards later on.

Anyways, to progress the story, talk to the machine in the upper left corner. We'll learn about our next task: Victory Road's first gem logic puzzle. You could use Pen & Paper to solve these - I find that a spreadsheet works the best for me. <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">You can download my go-to logic puzzle spreadsheet here.</a> I will provide each solution as well as explain how logically to reach them.

The clues this round are:

1. No two crystals share the same quality.
2. The Hardness of Ruby is 7.
3. Ruby is larger than Amethyst, but it is not the largest.
4. Amethyst's Purity is 'Middling.
5. The 'Pure' gem is Medium-sized.
6. Emerald is less pure than Ruby, but more pure than Sapphire.
7. The smallest gem is also the softest.
8. Sapphire's Hardness is less than Emerald's Hardness.
9. The largest gem is the least pure.

So, we can get to work. The spreadsheet can help you with this process.

Some of these hints are straightforward, but there are a few things that might not be as obvious here:

- From Clue 3, we notice that Ruby is larger than Amethyst, hence Ruby cannot be size 5, and Amethyst cannot be size 8. Since Ruby is not the largest, Ruby also cannot be size 8, so it is at most 7, meaning Amethyst cannot be size 7. Look for opportunities like these to rule out pairings.
- Clues 4 and 6 can actually entirely tell us the purity of the four gems. Clues comparing three gems are very helpful.
- Clues like 7 appear to not help us figure out which color is which property at first, but it also means you can automatically know that if Ruby is Small, then it is 5, and vice versa. On the spreadsheet, you can create a rectangle of "O"s, with a top line across the gem section at the top, and a bottom line going from the diagonal line to the final node. When you're stuck, try filling these in.
- You'll also notice throughout that in each 4-by-4 box, if any row or column has only 1 non-X space, you can automatically fill it in with an O.

Putting these steps together should get you a solution.

The solution for the first puzzle:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_puzzle_1.jpg"/>

Once you finish, talk to Cal and show him the solution. Grab the hidden *X Sp. Atk* and proceed to the next room.

### The First Rail Puzzles

Be careful, as Blake will again drop Icicles on you that can harm your Pokemon. Climb the stairs to the right and follow the path to fight another spirit.

Back down the stairs, follow the path down this time. You'll see the first railcart puzzle of this section, this one is pretty easy to get you into it.

- Talk to the filled minecart at the top. It will move down and left.
- Switch both levers.
- Talk to the minecart again. It will go left and dump out its rocks, creating a shortcut to the start of the dungeon.
- Switch the left lever, then jump in the minecart and enter the next room.

Jump into this minecart (1) to proceed to the main part of this room, then go right to talk to Charlotte. Head left after the conversation to grab a hidden *Revive*. Time for another minecart puzzle.

- Jump into the minecart (3) towards the bottom left of the area. Switch the lever here (A).
- Jump back in the minecart (4). Pick up a hidden *Super Repel* and jump in the left minecart (6).
- Switch this lever (B) and jump back in the minecart (7).
- Follow the path down and right, then switch this lever (C).
- Jump back in the minecart (8), and reverse the steps until you reach the right side of the area (B, 7, 5).
- If you'd like, cross the tracks at the gold spots on the ground, and follow the Rock Climb path for a spirit fight (path in green).

Anyways,

- Jump into the lower minecart (11) to reach the next area. Use Rock Climb here.
- You'll need to push this Strength boulder onto the pressure pad by going left, up, right, and up (save often).
- Go up through this new path, and switch the lever (D). Back down, jump into the top minecart (10).
- Switch this lever (E), then jump back into this minecart (13).
- Head back up above the pressure pad and switch this lever back (D), then go down and once more jump into the top minecart, following the path (10, 14).
- Push this strength boulder up twice.
- Head left between the two sets of stairs here. Follow this path to a hidden *Green Shard* and the *Tyranitarite*.
- From here, we'll actually need to back track all the way to the top left corner of the room. Aside from the boulder moving, you'll need to reverse all the steps we took to get here (15, 9, D, 10, E, 13, D, 10, 14, 6, B, 7, C, 8, B, 7, 5, A, 4).
- Push the boulder left, up, and onto the pressure pad.
- Switch the lever (F) in the newly opened path.
- Jump in the nearby minecart (2) to exit this room.

We'll be back in the main room from here. Again, Blake will be trying to hit us with Icicles, so be careful. Climb down the stairs, pushing boulders aside as you go. Climb up some rocks to get a hidden *Synthetic Seed*.

When you reach the section with tons of rocks, your goal will be to push the bottom right one to the right, to where the item ball containing the *Escape Rope* is. If you can do this, then you can walk down and push a rock onto a pressure pad. To do this, go down and right first, then slalom down and left, then finally go down and right again. Save beforehand to make sure you don't get stuck and have to actually use the Escape Rope! It should look something like this:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_hub_1.png"/>

Follow the opened path downward, pushing a boulder one tile right onto the pad. Going up and around, push another boulder out of the way to its left, then go back up, left, and down to reach the bottom left. Grab the hidden *Ultra Potion* and jump into the minecart here. Push this lever, then jump back into this minecart.

Before we enter the door at the bottom, climb the rocks to the right and follow the path to another spirit.

Return to the center of the room, and make your way to the right. There are four minecarts here - we will need to take all four of these, though we can do it in any order. I will start by jumping in the bottom minecart (D).

When you land, Blake will be shooting Icicles at us once more. Start by pushing the nearby boulder up as much as it will go, then hop into the minecart. Push the boulder left and up onto the pressure pad, hop back in the minecart, switch the lever, and hop in the minecart again.

In the basement, our goal will be to successfully push the minecart full of explosives into the pillar in the top left corner. To accomplish this, we'll need a straight track from the start to the pillar, since any intermediate positions will cause it to bounce back. The steps for this room are:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_mines_se.png"/>

- Push the nearby boulder up and out of the way. You can grab a hidden *Electric Gem* via the Rock Climb path. Don't jump down the ledge though, climb back down.
- Switch the bottom lever (A). Go around the bottom of the tracks, then proceed up from here. Smash the rock and push the left boulder to the left.
- Head back down to the bottom and switch the second and third levers from the bottom (B, C).
- Go up and left, and press the top-left lever (E).
- Cross the tracks to the left, go down, and follow the now-opened path to the right. Push the right boulder down twice. Switch the nearby lever (D).
- Switch off the lever in the top left (E).
- Following the left path, head back to the bottom of this area. Flip the bottom switch (A).
- Talk to the minecart. It should explode the pillar. Switch the bottom lever (A) once more and make the long way around to return to the rock climb spot. Follow the path down, around, and out - grabbing the hidden *Purple Shard* along the way.

That's it for this portion - head up and return to Charlotte's room. We have to pick another minecart: I will do the left one (L) this time. Once again, beware of Blake's Icicles when you land.

In the bottom left, you can get a hidden *Blue Shard* by Rock Climb. Don't jump down the ledge though. There is a boulder in the right side, we will need to push it onto the pressure pad at the bottom. Unfortunately the gems and rocks in the center of the room are in the way - you'll need to push it to the top left corner before it can successfully go down and onto the pressure pad. Jump into the minecart.

This room has a similar puzzle to the previous, though this time the explosives can stop at intermediate points. The solution:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_mines_sw.png"/>

- Switch the top left lever (A) then push the minecart. Switch this lever back.
- Switch the bottom left lever (B), then go right and switch the bottom right lever (C).
- Switch the now-opened lever in the top right (D), then the top middle lever (E).
- Push the minecart. Switch the bottom-right lever (B) and push the minecart again.
- Switch the bottom left lever (B) in order to switch off the bottom right lever (C), then push the minecart. Switch off the bottom right lever (C).
- Switch off the top right lever (D), then push the minecart and switch the lever (D) back.
- Switch both of the leftmost levers on top (A, E) and push the minecart. Follow it up, going around the right side of the room to reach the cart.
- Switch the first lever you reach (F) and push the cart. Repeat this for the top lever (G) by going all the way around, and the pillar will explode once more.
- Climb down the rocks on the left side to exit.

Make your way back to Charlotte's room and choose a new minecart: I will do the one on the right (R).

There is a substantial puzzle in Blake's Icicle hell, so be careful. The steps:

- Jump in the cart and flip the nearby lever. Jump in the cart to the left.
- Push the boulder to the right, and grab a hidden *Max Repel* up above.
- Jump back into the minecart at the bottom. Transfer to the other minecart.
- From here, push the filled cart. Make your way back to the top left corner.
- Flip the nearby switch and talk to the filled cart. Use Rock Climb on the path that opens to reach the basement once more.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_mines_ne.png"/>

Time for another "strength puzzle that takes way longer than it seems it should". This time, you'll need to move the boulder that starts on top into the center of the track loop. To do this, continually move it clockwise around the loop, pushing it inward whenever you can without it getting stuck. You'll need to do a lot of track-crossing to succeed. The good news is: once you get it onto the pressure pad, the explosives will ram into the pillar with a simple push. Exit in the bottom right.

One more path to go down: take the top minecart (U) in Charlotte's room.

In this next room, you'll need to push both boulders to the left: one above, one below. The final move for each has to be made from the other side. Solve each rock fully one-at-a-time, then climb down into the pit.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_mines_nw.png"/>

In this room, you'll need to load carts with rocks, dumping it to create climbing paths. The solution:

- Switch the first lever (A) and jump in the cart. Fill it with rocks. Switch the lever (A) back and push the cart down.
- Head down and take the cart back up. Fill it with rocks once more.
- Switch the two levers below (A, B). Push the cart again, then follow it down and ride it back up. Fill it up!
- Switch the bottom lever (C), then make your way back up to the cart. Push it down.
- Climb down all the rocks and push the explosives into the pillar.

Climb down to the left, then go up and talk to Charlotte. We have successfully destroyed the pillar!

### Logic Puzzle 2

Make your way down two rooms, to the large room where Icicles rained down. Take the cart up, then go slightly up and to the right over the rock climbs. After talking to Charlotte, go right. Grab the hidden *Purple Shard*. Enter the next cave. After seeing a conversation and avoiding Fern's arrows, enter the cave at the top.

There is a hidden *Max Potion* and *Green Shard* in this room. Anyways, time for our second logic puzzle. The hints and <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">spreadsheet</a> from the previous puzzle should be useful here as well, note that there are more categories this time.
The clues:

1. No two crystals share any same quality.
2. The second hardest gem is 'Pure'.
3. Ruby has more Foliation than, and is larger than, Sapphire.
4. Sapphire is more pure than Amethyst.
5. The third hardest gem is of 'Middling' Purity.
6. Neither Emerald nor Amethyst is either the least or most pure.
7. The hardest gem has the most Foliation.
8. Sapphire has less Foliation than the 'Pure' gem, which has less Foliation than Amethyst.
9. The softest gem is the smallest one.
10. Emerald is smaller than Ruby, which is smaller than Amethyst.

The solution:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_puzzle_2.jpg"/>

Grab the hidden *Muscle Wing* in the bottom right corner and return to the arrow hell room. In here, you'll need to push boulders out of the way. Save often, and turning off super speed for your sanity. Note that when you reach two pressure pads, push the boulder up once, climb around, then push it down twice to proceed. Along this path you'll get a *Max Revive* and hidden *X Sp. Def* and *Ultra Potion*.

You'll need to push boulders along the path into specific places and push one more onto a pressure pad and... yeah. We trap ourselves. Thankfully we get rescued by cart! Grab the hidden *Green Shard* and enter the next room.

### The Final Rail Puzzle

Pick up the hidden *Red-Hots* and *Fire Gem* in this area. Time for yet another massive rail puzzle. 

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_mines_final.png"/>

- Jump into the railcart on the bottom (1). Climb the nearby rocks to get a hidden *Red Shard*.
- There will now be three railcarts all in the same area. Jump into the middle one (3) to reach a spirit.

Anyways, back to the puzzle.

- Take this minecart back (4), then jump into the top minecart (5). Smash the nearby rock but ignore the boulder for now.
- Take the minecart (6) back up, and jump into the bottom of three minecarts (2). From here, jump into the other minecart, on the upper right side (7). Grab the hidden *Red Shard*.
- Push the boulder down and right onto the pressure pad, then take the minecart (8) back to the right. 
- There is a path to the left across some tracks that lead to a lever (A): switch it.
- Jump into the bottom minecart (1), and it will take you to another lever (B): switch it.
- Use the cart (9) to go back down, then switch off the first lever (A).
- Jump into the bottom cart (1) one more, then into the top of three minecarts (5). To your right is a lever (C): switch it.
- Jump back into this minecart (6), then into the middle of three minecarts (3). This will take you to a pile of rocks (10) - fill the cart, then push it.
- Climb down the rocks and jump into the top minecart (5). Switch off the lever (C) to your right. 
- Go up from the boulder in the bottom left corner, and cross the long line of tracks (yellow arrows). This will lead you to another lever (D) - switch it. Head left and up from here to get a hidden *PP Up*.
- Jump back in the minecart in the bottom left (6), then push the cart full of rocks (3).
- Jump into the top minecart (5), then follow the path up and left from the boulder across the tracks (yellow arrows) once more. You'll now see a new climbable path - take it, then talk to the explosives.
- Push the cart full of explosives (11), then push the lever (D) across the tracks on the right.
- Make your way to the bottom left corner. Jump into the minecart (6) to return to the top left corner. Talk to the filled cart to make an explosion!
- Jump into the bottom minecart (2). From here, go left and up, pushing the lever (A). Take the minecart (1) to reach the top right side of the area, where you can finally exit (12)!

### Introduction to the Gem Chambers

The next room I will call the "central gem room". In the central gem room, climb down either rock. You can get a hidden *Elemental Seed* here. Climb the rocks on the left side of this area. You can get a hidden *Max Repel*. Enter the Sapphire area in the top left corner.

Fun fact about this one: apparently when Savage challenged the Reborn League back in the day, Shade used a Shedinja. Wonder why Savage went mad.

Use the Blue Crystal Key atop the central hill to create a path in the ice puzzle. Cross this path (D L U R D L D) and grab a hidden *Cheri Berry*. Proceed to the next room.

Grab the hidden *Telluric Seed* and *Fairy Gem*, then use the Purple Crystal Key. Climb up and out to the left.

Back in the central gem room, push the boulder into place then pick up the hidden *Swift Wing*. Climb to the center of the central gem room and go down through the now-opened gates. Use the levers to open some shortcuts. Follow this path to the next room.

### Logic Puzzle 3

We're back in the room with the massive rail puzzle - but worry not, as we don't have to do any more railing for now. Pick up the hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Heart Scale*, *Star Piece*, and *Max Elixir* as you proceed through the path and into the next room.

We'll find ourselves on an upper path of the room where Fern tried to hit us with arrows. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and proceed to the next room.

We'll find ourselves in Charous Mountain. After a conversation, proceed through this room. Grab a hidden *Ice Heal* along the way.

Enter the next room and grab the hidden *Magical Seed*. Pick up the hidden *Max Elixir* and *Purple Shard* in the rest of the room after another conversation.

Oh boy, it's time for another logic puzzle - this time with five categories. Download the <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">spreadsheet</a> if you'd like. Hope you're ready.

The clues:

1. No two crystals share the same quality.
2. Ruby is bigger than Sapphire.
3. Sapphire's Purity is less than Ruby's Purity, which is less than Amethyst's Purity.
4. Amethyst does not have 'Vitreous' Luster.
5. Ruby is more lustrous than Amethyst, which is more lustrous than Sapphire.
6. Amethyst is not 'Miniscule'.
7. Ruby has less Foliation than Sapphire.
8. The largest gem is more lustrous than the smallest gem.
9. The gem with 'Difficult' Foliation is smaller than Emerald.
10. Amethyst has 'Eminent' Foliation.
11. The gems are, in order of ascending hardness: the 'Medium' gem, the 'Middling' Purity gem, the gem with the least foliation, and the 'Pearly' gem.
12. The 'Indistinct' gem is also the least pure.

The solution:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_puzzle_3.jpg"/>

Head back down to the main part of the room: there is another logic puzzle waiting for us... And this one, is a doozy. If you have managed to avoid using the <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">spreadsheet</a> by now, I recommend it.

The clues:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Solve Logic Puzzle 4 in five or fewer tries (+1 Radomus)

### Dropping the Stalactite

We'll find ourselves back in the previous hub room where Fern is, but on the highest level. Go down the path and talk to Hardy here, and the stalactite will be dropped. Back to the left, a new path will be opened up. Left and up from here, you can get a hidden *Synthetic Seed* and fight a spirit.

Head down from here, and you'll find yourself in the left side of this large room. Down from here you can find rocks to climb to proceed to the right. Grab a hidden *Dusk Ball* here, then go down the rocks on the bottom. The cave entrance here is just a shortcut to a previous area, so go to the right instead. Pick up the hidden *Magical Seed* and fight another spirit.

Make your way back to the center of the room and continue climbing rocks up and to the right. To the right of where Fern trapped us, get a hidden *Ultra Potion* then climb up and grab the hidden *Muscle Wing*. Exit out to a lower section of Charous Path.

When you reach a fork, go down the rocks to get the *Metagrossite*! Back on the main path is a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Calcium*, and *PokeSnax*.

At the bridge, on Zekrom route, you'll see a story sequence play out. On Reshiram route, you'll obtain Taka's Chatot. Grab the *Purple Shard* and continue into the next room.

Next, proceed through the red rock and ice bridge path that is now to your right. Push the nearby strength boulder down so it is out of the way, then return to the Red Crystal and activate it again.

Down and left, a new path will be opened up. Climb down onto the ice, grab hidden *Ice Heal* at the bottom, then use the rightmost Rock Climb spot to go up and left to activate another Blue Crystal. Return to the left side of the room to grab the *Lucarionite* and fight another spirit.

### The Ruby Chamber

Step on the panel towards the top and talk to Florinia. Heading down from here, a warp tile will appear. Take it to return to the central gem room from earlier.

We need to return to each of the four gem rooms we were in earlier. I will start with Ruby, in the top right corner.

Use the Red Crystal Key and go up. Grab the hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Proceed to the next room.

Pick up the hidden *HP Up* here. As you might expect, it's time for a larger puzzle involving the Red Crystals that move rock climb spots around.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_ruby.png"/>

- Climb to the right and push the boulder left, out of the way. Climb back down, activate the first red crystal (1), then go right and follow the path.
- Activate the crystal on the hill (2), then go right and activate the next crystal (3). Reset the previous one (2) so you can go left up both rocks.
- Follow this path to the left. You'll reach another crystal (4): activate it. To proceed, you'll need to double back around the bottom side of the room (through 1, 2, 3)
- Activate both crystals (5, 6) you find in the next area. Follow the path this creates, then use the left crystal again (5) to create a new path to the left. Follow it up.
- Push the boulder down twice to get it out of the way here, then activate the nearby crystal (7). You'll have to go down, activate the left crystal (5) again, then and make your way back up. Past the boulder, there should be a new path in the top left to follow (7, using the rock climb near 9). Down from here is a spirit.

Continuing with the puzzle:

- Up and left, activate another crystal (8). Once more, we'll have to drop down and make our way all the way back around the bottom right side of the room (using the climbs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9)...
- Climb the new set of rocks (8), but don't go up the one to the left quite yet, instead, head up and rock climb towards the center of the room. Activate the crystal on the left (9).
- Back down and left (towards 8), climb up on the left side, going clockwise around the room. Down a rock climb, activate a crystal (10).
- Make your way back to the left side of the room via going towards the previous climbs (past 9 and 8) and go up to get 3 *Glitter Balls*!
- Heading back up towards the top of the room (above 8 and below 9), take the rocks generated previously by using the crystal (9) to go down towards the center of the room. 
- Use the two crystals here (11, then 12 twice from two different angles, then 11 again) to navigate around the center of the area, grabbing a hidden *Dragon Gem* in the middle, then go right. Grab the hidden *Escape Rope*.
- Climb down the lower rocks (at 13) to push the rock onto the pressure pad, then activate the crystal (13). Follow the path to the right side of the area.
- Again, you'll use two sets of two crystals each to maneuver through this area (14, 6, 14 again).
- Climb up from here. You'll need to activate two crystals here (15, 16), then head up and down the ledge. Backtrack through the center using the crystal by the pressure plate (13) to return to the bottom right side.
- Activate the crystal in the way (15), then follow the path made earlier (16). Creep along the right side as you go up, and grab a hidden *Purple Shard*. Before entering the cave, follow the path on the right side down to reach another spirit.

This is the first fight in the game with natural Psychic Terrain. Thankfully it's not too crazy for now... just wait until the postgame!

Anyways, return to the top right corner to enter B5F. Prepare for a fight.

Our final fight with this guy is a toughie. His leads employ double strategies like Intimidate + Lightning Rod + Discharge. Notably his Tyrantrum makes amazing use of the field - one Dragon Dance will boost it to +2, making it able to OHKO most of your Pokemon with ease. However, with good doubles strategies and/or a bit of Dragon move spam, you can surely defeat Paul Clark from accounting.

After winning, you'll be free to explore this room. Make sure you grab the 3 *Ruby Stars* before leaving, as we'll need those. Oh, and get the hidden *Big Nugget* too. Take the warp point back to the central gem room!

### The Sapphire Chamber

Use one of the three conveniently placed Light Shards if you want, and make your way to the Sapphire room in the top left. Pick up the hidden *Max Ether* and proceed into the door at the top.

In this room, we have to use Blue Crystals to open up spots on the ice for navigation. There's a crystal to the left: use it to make a path across the ice, then cross (L D L) and climb up.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_sapphire_1.png"/>

Grab the hidden *Magical Seed* then enter the next ice puzzle. You'll need to first make your way to the very bottom of the ice (L D R U R D R U L D L D), climb up, and activate the crystal. Before proceeding, there is a sneaky rock climb path on the right side here leading to a spirit.

Anyways, back down on the puzzle, we can now reach the top middle to activate another crystal (R U R D L U). This lets you get to the top left and escape (D L D R D L U L).

Head right, picking up the hidden *Blue Shard*. This next ice sheet is massive, so here's a step by step guide for this part:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_sapphire_2.png"/>

- L U L D R D R U L, activate the crystal (1) at the top of the hill, then climb back down.
- R D L U L U2 L U L U L D R U L U L D L, activate crystal (2).
- D R U R D, activate crystal (3).
- U R D L U R U R D R D R D R D R (now at the starting tile) U L D L U R U L U R D L U R, activate crystal (4).
- L D R U L U L D R D L U R U R D R D R D R D R (now at the starting tile) U L D L U L U L U L D, activate crystal (5).
- R D L2 U L U R D L D R U R, climb up. Grab the hidden *Guard Spec*.

Head into the next room when you're ready.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Blake you will get in his way (-1 Blake)
- Tell Blake you won't get in his way (+1 Blake)

One more round with this guy too. Unfortunately for us, his team of Water and Ice types doesn't mess around, combining two of the best offensive types with a field effect that lets them stack speed on you, power up their attacks, neutralize Fire and Rock moves easily, and more. This time, the field isn't stacked on top of a Water Surface, so you can't burn it away. Fighting and Electric moves are generally good keys to victory for this fight, especially if you have some priority moves that help you boost your speed and Brick Break to knock out his screens.

Grab the hidden *Heart Scale* and *Protein* as well as the three *Sapphire Stars*, then warp back.

### The Emerald Chamber

Enter the Emerald room in the bottom left next.

Grab the hidden *Max Elixir* and exit at the bottom.

In this next room, pick up the hidden *Repel* and *Ultra Ball*. There is a path along the bottom that will take you to a Green Crystal: activate it.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_emerald.png"/>

Head to the middle of the room and climb down, then activate the Green Crystal. Fern will start firing arrows at us. Once you get control, turn off speed up for your sanity, then start avoiding the arrows. If you get hit by one, it will drag you backwards, and deal damage to your team. There is a Light Shard at the bottom of the room. Since your Pokemon won't die from the arrows, might as well solve most of the puzzle before using the Shard. Oh, and there's a hidden *Genius Wing* on the left side if you have an opportunity to grab it.

On the left side of the area, climb the ivy (1) to follow the path we made earlier to a spirit.

To defeat Fern in this room:

- Back down in the main area, follow the ground-level path (2) on the left side. Push the boulder up, right, and up, onto the pressure pad.
- Next, follow the second ground-level path (4) from the left up, and pull the lever.
- Climb the ivy between these two paths (3) and go up. Push the lever, then talk to the Crystal to deal the first blow to Decidueye.
- Climb the next ivy to the right (5), and activate this lever.
- Go to the third ground-level path from the left (6) and go up. Pull the lever at its end.
- Head over to the rightmost ground-level path (12), go up, and switch the lever.
- Climb the second-from-the-right ivy (9), and switch the lever.
- In the bottom left side of the area, there is a boulder. You'll need to push it right and up the second from the right ground-level path (10) onto a pressure plate at the top.
- This will open up the path up from the rightmost ivy (11). Follow it, switch the lever, and activate the crystal to deal the second blow to Decidueye.
- Finally, the middle ivy path (7) will be open. Follow it to the crystal and deliver the last blow to Decidueye.

With that out of the way, now is a great chance to use the Light Shard! You can now take the long path (8) up to the top of the room. Grab the hidden *Grass Gem*, then climb the rocks on the right side of the top of the room to reach another spirit.

Use the warp tile to return to the central gem room.

### The Amethyst Chamber

Finally, head over to the Amethyst room in the bottom right corner. Pickup the hidden *Max Ether* and proceed into the room at the bottom.

Grab the hidden *Calcium* near the start, then prepare yourself for what's to come! Basically, you'll need to dodge the void, which aims for you. Getting hit by it will send you back to the start, unfortunately. To proceed in each area, look for the Purple Crystal and get the void to land on top of it.

More tips: don't use speedup, don't use repels, since the "another?" message will actually cause you to be a sitting duck for the void; there aren't wild Pokemon here. Create straight lines for the void to follow onto the crystals to make it more predictable. Finally, save often!

Once you exit the room at the bottom successfully, you can return to the previous room, where you will no longer be chased. In here we can find a hidden *Protein* and *Carbos*.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_amethyst.png"/>

Towards the top of the room, you can follow a rock climb path to the *Salamencite*!

In the bottom left side of the room, we can access a path that takes us up some rocks and to a spirit.

Pick up the hidden *PP Up*, *Max Revive*, *Hyper Potion*, and the 3 *Amethyst Stars*. Return to the central gem room via the new warp.

### Victory over Victory Road

Back in the central gem room, take the warp back to Florinia. You'll need to place 7 of the 12 stars into the slots, then step on the tile above. On the left side, you'll see gems light up gold corresponding to the number of correct stars you've picked. On the right, you'll see gems light up silver corresponding to the correct orientation of the gems.

And... it's actually random what the correct answer is per save file, so I can't just give you the solution this time.

Solving this thankfully isn't too bad (especially compared to the last Logic Puzzle we did...) since we have infinite tries. What I like to do is place all 3 Ruby Stars in, and see how many light up. Take away all but that number of Ruby Stars, then move them around until the right side lights up with the same number. Repeat this for Sapphire Stars next, knowing that the Ruby gems are correct. Emerald can then assume Ruby and Sapphire are correct... so it's pretty simple from here. Soon you'll be done!

Enter the next room and pick up the hidden *Full Heal*. Once you're ready for a tough fight, head up and right.

One more round with our favorite Swag Jockey. His team is pimped out for maximal pain on the field, which... aside from an early game Aster & Eclipse fight and Ditto-Arceus, we haven't gotten to fight any significant trainers on. Three of his Pokemon have Rock Tomb, which gets a 2.25x power boost here and alternate hitting with Fire, Water, Grass, then Psychic sub-typing, cyclically. Any Pokemon's use of a Rock move, Multi-Attack, Strength, or Rock Climb will cause the sub-typing to move to the next, in fact. Dragon moves are also boosted here, so Haxorus (perhaps after a Dragon Dance), Krookodile (who will outspeed with its Scarf) and Serperior (perhaps after a Contrary Leaf Storm) will tear through you with theirs. Rhyperior's Rock Polish actually also boosts both attacking stats on this field, so if you can't take it out in the first turn, it might sweep you. It's also worth noting that Krookodile's Earthquake will turn the field to a Cave, where this move can now hit Flying type Pokemon you were hoping to switch in on it. Oh, and he has a Bullet Punch machine in Mega Scizor and a Z-Move 'roided Decidueye with priority.

By now, I know you can win this one! Aside from a generally well-built team, Pokemon that make careful use of the moves I mentioned earlier to gain beneficial sub-typings and ruin Fern's sub-typings can be useful here. Dragon types can fairly easily sweep here if you can get some momentum and Stealth Rocks going, as well. Transform it into the Dark Crystal Cavern or Cave if you like those options better.

Once you win, proceed to the right. Before we leave though, there is one last spirit that we can fight - hug the bottom wall as you go right to reach them. Grab the hidden *Ultra Potion* while you're here.

Make your way to the exit, grabbing the final hidden item of Victory Road... a *Blue Shard*. Exciting.

In the outside area in which you emerge, hug the bottom wall to pick up the *New World Field Readout*. Study up!

Head into the Pokemon Center up and to the right, and talk to the girl behind the counter to learn a bit about Reborn's Elite Four.

Before we do that, however, fly on over to the other side of Victory Road, just north of Labradorra. If you've been fighting the spirits, we can get rewards for doing so! Talk to Azer.

|*Catching Charm: Emerald*, *Life Orb*, *Leftovers* |25                             |

You'll also get the *Exp. All* for catching all the spirits if you haven't obtained it yet.

With that taken care of... that's really it. Every Pokemon, Mega Stone, Z-Crystal, hold item, TM... aside from those that relate to Legendary Pokemon, we now have 'em all. Nothing else is holding us back from finally doing this thing. Fly on back to Charous Mountain in the top right corner of the region and prepare yourself as best you can for what's to come.

## Reborn Elite Four & Champion

Enter the Charous Hall, to the right of the Pokemon Center. Reminisce on the eighteen gyms you've beaten as you head up! Once you pass into the door at the top, you'll be unable to return, so make sure you're ready.

Do you remember when we fought Corey, obtained the Silver Ring, and later found five of his six Pokemon? Now we know where his Crobat went. Fittingly, Heather uses Flying and Poison type Pokemon.

On this field, Tailwind lasts for five turns and sets up Strong Winds. Crobat's speed and its Sash means you're not going to be able to easily steamroll with Ice, Electric, and Rock type moves once it gets off Tailwind. Archeops, another fast Pokemon, also has this move for support. Flying moves and Rock moves are all boosted here, meaning Crobat, Archeops, Gyarados with its Z-Crystal, and Salamence will all hit like trucks. Additionally, her Gengar's Icy Wind and Ominous Wind are boosted by 1.5x on this field, then again by 1.5x whenever Strong Winds are present. Oh, and Thunder never misses. A very tough optimized fight, but nothing too unexpected for Reborn's Elite Four.

It's hard to recommend changing up your team specifically for this fight, because you have to bring the same team through the entire Elite Four. Still, if you are stuck on this fight, there are a lot of things you can use. For example, while Strong Winds do neutralize Flying type weaknesses, you can use the Thunder, Icy Wind, Hyper Voice, and Rock move boosts yourself to narrow the gap. Especially once Crobat and Archeops are down, that may be the way to victory. Trick Room will also help you turn Tailwind on its head if need be, where a Pokemon like Decidueye with a 1.5x attack boost from Long Reach may be able to sweep. You can also use your own Flying types to deal massive damage: Talonflame's Gale Wings is always on while Strong Winds are on, for example. Alternatively, you could consider switching the field to Snowy Mountain via the Blizzard TM if you want to use Ice moves more effectively.

Once you win, you'll get the *Ruby Ring*. Proceed to the next room.

Good news: it's not a 12v6. Bad news: Bennett and Laura use Bug and Grass types on the most broken field effect in the game that we haven't yet seen even once: Flower Garden, with natural Rain to boot. Flower Garden has 5 stages, each stage essentially being more beneficial for their team than the last. It starts at Stage 1, but the Synthetic Seeds on the leads will automatically bump it up to Stage 3. Three more seeds in the back, Venusaur's Bloom Doom, Lilligant's Growth, and three Pokemons' Nature Power (which becomes Growth) will each up the stage. Swarm will always be on, boosting Volcarona and Galvantula's Bug Buzz, and gets an additional boost on Stages 3 and 5. If used at Stage 1 or 3, Growth will get powered up, so watch out for that. Grass moves get increasingly powerful as the stage increases, and Bug moves have boosts specifically on Stages 2 and 4. The five Synthetic Seeds also boost Special Defense and grant Ingrain, which is four times as powerful on Stage 4 specifically. Oh, and in Stages 4 and 5, Chlorophyll will always be on, meaning half of their Pokemon will consistently outspeed and destroy your team with their field-boosted moves. Lots to try to remember even though you can't access the field notes during the fight.

One thing to consider is just using the field yourself. If you can spare a party slot or two, you can bring a few Pokemon optimized for Stage 5 Flower Field and go off. Bennett and Laura only take advantage of maybe half of the boosts this field provides, so you can try using the other half. For example, Sweet Scent at Stage 5 lowers Evasion, Def, and SpD by 3 stages each, so using this move with something fast can set up your other Pokemon for easy knockouts. Flower Shield and Flower Veil grant massive defense boosts to your Pokemon and Grass type allies, meaning you can just out-tank your Grass type opponents by targeting the Bug types first. Infestation does a massive 1/3 HP each turn, so if you can get this move out and wait out a few turns, you can easily clean up that way. Nature Power is Growth up until Stage 5, when it becomes Petal Blizzard, meaning this move will allow your Pokemon to set up and sweep all in one! You can also use your own offensive Bug moves - fighting Swarm users with Swarm users may be smart, or you can carefully keep the field at Stage 4 in order to benefit from those boosts.

Or, you can try to fight the Flower Field directly. Cut gets a 1.5x boost and deals an additional 2x damage to Grass types, meaning it can effectively hit with 150 Power against the Grass types. It and X-Scissor cut down the stage by one, meaning once all the seeds are exhausted, you may be able to keep the Stage relatively low by spamming these. Using the Poisonium-Z to fire off a Acid Downpour will instantly take the field back to Stage 1. With good timing, this will allow you to halt their momentum and hopefully get some of your own going.

Perhaps you could just change the field altogether: Sun will turn the field into the Rainbow Field for a little while, so you can try to devise a strategy involving that field if you want. What's better though is Burning Field. The Rain will stop you from turning the field to Burning Field, as would Sand. It's a bit tricky to set up, but Hail (we have the TM) followed up by a burning move like Lava Plume or Inferno Overdrive (we have the Z-Crystal) will succeed at this task! You can probably guess how well your opponents team will do on the Burning Field.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett you know what Apolysis is (+1 Bennett)

You'll get the *Sapphire Bracelets* for winning. Proceed to the next room, and ride the tile elevators upward.

We finally get to fight Arceus' favorite holy man. He uses Normal and Dragon types on the Holy Field. Notably, Normal moves become super effective against Ghost and Dark types, and special Normal moves like Noivern's Boomburst get a power boost. Dragon and Psychic moves also get boosts, making Noivern, Kommo-o, Dragonite, and Drampa even more powerful. On the Physical side, Dragonite's Extremespeed and Mega Kangaskhan's Return also get boosted on this field. With Mega Kangaskhan's double Power-Up-Punch, Noivern's SpA boosting seed, and Kommo-o's omniboosting Z-Move, there are a lot of threats that can set up on you, making the aforementioned moves even more powerful. Oh, and he has a Choice Scarf Imposter Ditto that loves to swap in as soon as any of your sweepers set up to outspeed and kill.

There are no built in field switches for this one, but it does leave you a few great options. Notably, special Fairy type moves and your own Dragon type moves are boosted here, so if you're able to get them off, you can potentially sweep Noivern, Drampa, Kommo-O, and Dragonite after hazards. You can also abuse Nature Power Judgement, Return, and Extremespeed for massive power boosts. Rock and Steel types can switch in on Banded Dragonite doing a power trip with Extremespeed, giving them a chance to turn momentum in your favor. Just have a plan for Scarf Impostor Ditto!

Take the *Emerald Brooch* and proceed to the next room.

The last Elite Four member is a child who will destroy your team with her Psychic and Fairy types on top of the Starlight Arena. Psychic and Fairy moves are boosted here, and Dark moves get a Fairy subtyping, taking away one of Metagross' weaknesses. There are further boosts for Ninetales' Aurora Beam, Gardevoir's Signal Beam, Starmie's Flash Cannon, Gardevoir and Ninetales' Moonblast, Sylveon's Swift, and a massive boost for Mega Metagross' Meteor Mash that shreds almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Starmie with its seed and ability gets +3 SpA upon switch in, which paired with its high speed and coverage moves, means danger. Defensively, Cosmic Power and Wish are boosted, so Sylveon and Jirachi can potentially tank you. Ninetales' Aurora Veil is also always enabled.

If you want to win this one, as usual I think you can get away with taking advantage of the field yourself. Your own Meteor Mash, Mirror Shot, and Moonblast can all be potentially viable here. Wish and Moonlight heal more than usual, and Cosmic Power works for you too, so you can take advantage of the lack of priority aside from Bullet Punch to set up a tank of your own. Any weather condition will turn off the type boosts and the Fairy subtyping for Dark moves, so if you want to neuter her offensive power to some extent you can change the weather. We can't destroy the field or change it naturally, so make use of your teams synergy and the field effect to win this one.

You'll get the *Amethyst Pendant*. Proceed to the Champion room when you're ready.

So, a Champion fight. If you look carefully, you'll notice that this team is almost entirely comprised of Pokemon stolen from Lin's victims... Ninetales from Ame, Gossip Gardevoir, Garchomp from Solaris, Conkeldurr/Togekiss from Samson/Ciel, and Delphox from Ace... So that's something. No field this time, so compared to the previous four fights this one generally won't be as bad. There is PULSE Abra in the back, this time not using Hyper Beam every turn, so you have to find a way to live its high powered special moves and hit back hard after defeating the other five Pokemon. You can take out the champion, I believe in you!

Once you regain control, head up and through the path. You'll need to use the Emerald Brooch on the first floor and solve a quick logic puzzle.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Or so it would seem. All four are Dark.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the puzzle solution</a>
</div>

In the Sapphire Bracelet room ahead is... another puzzle? Just choose an answer for each one. Proceeding from here, you can get the *PULSE Readout 11*. Oh boy.

Make your way to the top of the Arc and talk to Lin. Prepare your team and head in... Reborn's REAL champion fight is ahead.

Across this guide I've mentioned various choices that you can make to reach an exclusive postgame route - known by the community as the Anna Route. If you do not complete any one of the requirements for the Anna route, you will instead be on the Lin Route for the postgame. However, I actually think the first time player will get MORE out of the Lin Route than the Anna Route as far as the story goes, so don't feel like you're left out if you have missed one of the requirements. The Lin Route is still great and you should consider doing it first, going back for the Anna Route in a second playthrough. There is still one 'choice' left to make, so you can still opt out of the Anna Route if you'd like.

A summary of the Anna Route requirements till now:

1. Find all the police officers before fighting Ace in the Jungle
2. Defeat Solaris atop Pyrous Mountain
3. Refuse to fight Sigmund at Yureyu
4. Stop the doctor at Belrose
5. Side with Radomus at Citae Astrae, then defeat El
6. Don't give Blake the Ruby Ring
7. Refuse to fight Taka at the WTC
8. Allow Taka to join you in the desert

If you thought Lin's earlier fight was a bit too easy... well... there's this... a fitting end to the main game of Pokemon Reborn... and it's just brutal.

Let me first pause to make fun of some of you. Did you create your team largely around utilizing a specific weather condition? Or, are you even more crafty and use Pledge moves to create your own field, or perhaps the Lycanium-Z to destroy fields you don't like? Do you like the move Earthquake? Well, surprise, none of those things work here. Weather effects and generated fields simply do not work, so you'll always be fighting on New World without weather. And to lose against this fight means you'll have to go all the way back through the previous five. Your team is complete trash without your weather or field? Sucks for you! Remake it and battle your way all the way back. By the way, when I said "some of you", I meant me in the past, marching on in with a Rain Mono-Water team. Pelipper literally died in one shot to every single one of Lin's Pokemon no matter what I did. Sad. But I did eventually win!

So, onto the fight itself. Power Gem, Earth Power, Draco Meteor, Dazzling Gleam, Flash Cannon, and Dark type moves are all boosted here. All of her Pokemon have at least one of these. The New World Field also has this thing where grounded Pokemon have three-quarters speed and levitating Pokemon have slightly lowered Defenses. Lin having 4/5 non-grounded Pokemon essentially means unless you have a lot of them too, you're going to basically be losing speed battles you'd otherwise win. The defense drop is cancelled out on her Pokemon by virtue of the PULSE2 adding defenses to the sweepers anyways.

As for the team itself, it's real good. Mismagius is a cruel lead, taking advantage of the field boosts and speed nerf to hit fast and hard. Honchkrow is there to ruin your sweeper's day, getting off Sucker Punch to probably knock you out and snowball into a sweep. Clefable does usual Clefable things: saying NOPE to your boosts, getting double Cosmic Power boosts, and laughing in your crying face. Flygon (on Anna Route) and Hydreigon like to mercilessly overwhelm your Pokemon with their wide coverage. She also has the first enemy Ultra Beast... ugh. This thing is super tanky, has a STAB boosted move in Flash Cannon and good coverage in Flamethrower and Giga Drain, and also carries Leech Seed just in case you thought you were smart about using a tanky Pokemon of some kind. And the most cursed ability ever: Beast Boost, which will raise its SpA in this case.

You'll notice that I haven't mentioned the puppy in the room. It seems like the route that so far is harder to get into has an easier time with this fight, and that's true... sorta. While Anna Route gets PULSE Arceus replaced by Flygon, winning the first, easier fight will actually send you right into another fight. No healing or switching your team around in between.

So, yeah. With a 975 Base Stat Total, Perfect IVs, and a PULSE 2, no matter your route, you get to fight this thing, and if you're fighting it separately, you don't get to carry any momentum like stat boosts or hazards over from fighting the other six Pokemon. For that reason, doing the two-fight gauntlet version is strictly harder than the one-fight version, so I will give some advice for doing the gauntlet version.

It's worth noting that this is actually the 9th and final Anna Route requirement:

**Once you win the first fight, if you lose the second fight, you will be kicked out of Anna Route.**

You'll also have to fight the first New World Lin fight again, this time, it will be the version without Arceus. You can restore a backup if you want. There's actually one automatically created for you in the saves folder.

Anyways, onto the strategy. Really, these fights come down to choreographing every single move pretty much. If you don't know whether Honchkrow is going to Sucker Punch or use its Z-move, you will probably lose. If a random attack of yours misses, it will likely throw off the whole fight and you will lose. Lots and lots of trial and error will probably be key here. I recommend setting your Z-move to Steel, Poison, or Rock in most cases. Clefable is usually the most annoying Pokemon to take out aside from Arceus, so having either a super-effective nuke or a field-boosted Continental Crush to take it out is usually a good idea. You may instead want to use it on Celesteela, in which case Fire, Electric, or field-boosted Dark are good bets. Even though all the other stuff like field changes and weather are out, ol' reliable TRICK ROOM is here to save the day - it even gets an automatic 8 turns on this field, freeing up your Trick Room user to hold something else like Light Clay. A Z-move of one of the aforementioned types or Mold Breaker on a slow set-up sweeper under Trick Room can barrel through the bulk of the team, freeing you up to worry about Arceus!

One more fun tech is that the Magical Seed grants an omniboost while causing you to recharge. If you hard switch, the Pokemon that comes out gets the recharge turn cancelled out as part of the switching turn, so that's nice. If you have a Pokemon with Recycle, it will cause the seed to be regenerated and consumed, but the recharge turn will again be done on that turn... meaning you can literally omniboost all the way to +6 if you have some way to not die in the meantime. A fun thing to turn to if all else seems lost.

Then there's Arceus. In the easier version, it is holding a Life Orb, so poisoning it then hiding behind Substitutes can be a funny way to watch it knock itself out. Unfortunately the harder version has a Z-Crystal and you don't get the time to set up anything on it, so you're going to have to use whatever scraps of your team remain after the previous fight to do... some cheap crap, pretty much. My first time it was just double Protect on Speed Boost Sharpedo followed by Destiny Bond. This time it was Accelerock for some chip plus a Sturdy Metal Burst. Some people will call strategies like these cheap, but what else can you really do against a Pokemon with 975 BST, full EV's, and IV's, and field boosts too? Do what you must and win both fights if you want to stay on Anna Route, or defeat just the one-team version to proceed to Lin Route.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat the 2-fight Lin Gauntlet and advance to Anna Route (-2 Terra)

Either way, once you complete this fight, you're like, done? You've completed the main game of Pokemon Reborn! Congratulations! I am proud of you! And thanks for reading so far :)

Head to any PC if you want to look at your Hall of Fame progress!

# Postgame Episode 1: A Whole New World

Bear with me: postgame is less episodically structured than the main game, and there aren't chapter names. So, I came up with my own names, with help from the Patreon Discord.

## The Developer Room

If this is the kind of thing that would interest you, enter the developer's room by talking to Ame's computer in the Grand Hall Basement. You can talk to the developers in here, though note that nothing in here is canon to Reborn.

Anyways, the first thing we're going to do is grab the fourth Catching Charm. Make a beeline to the room in the top right corner to grab the *Catching Charm: Sapphire*!

There is a case to be made that you should save actually talking to all these NPC's and reading the content here until after you've also beaten the postgame, though I will cover the currently available contents here regardless. You can battle the folks here optionally just for fun they'll give us BP for the Nightclub, which we'll get to in a bit. - they don't give any EXP and lock all levels to 100. They also use a ton of illegal movesets and some have custom abilities and typings.

## The Nightclub

Head over to North Obsidia Ward - we can finally enter the nightclub!

Once you talk to Arclight, you'll be free to move around. If you talk to the machine to the left of the nerd at the top, you can turn the chaotic lights off, if you'd like. Talk to the nerd here to record Pokemon's movesets - by doing this, you can save time (and Heart Scales) from having to visit tutors.

Talk to the various characters around the nightclub, if you'd like.

In the top left corner, there are various battle facilities. Winning them grants you Battle Points (BP) which can be exchanged for items.

To win BP, you can participate in the Nightclub's Battle Pavilion: Battle Tower and Battle Factory-style competitions, Theme Teams, and Mix N' Match. Try out these options and earn some BP if you'd like, or skip ahead to [the next section](#vanhanen-castle-new-world) to continue the postgame story.

## Battle Pavilion Facilities

The Battle Tower and Battle Factory modes work similarly to canon: the former lets you bring a team of three and the latter has you choose randomly from a pool. In these modes you can optionally choose to enable random field effects as well.

Challenges in the Tower and Factory are sets of five battles: losing a set rewards the player with *BP* equal to the number of battles won. If the player wins the set of five, *BP* is awarded as follows: `BP = w // 2 + 5 + 3RF + 3DB`, where `w` is the current win streak, `RF` is Random Fields being enabled and `DB` is doubles being enabled.

For the first four fights of each set in the Tower and all battles in the Factory, specific Pokemon sets as well as Trainer information for these facilities can be found within the `btpokemon.rb` and `bttrainers.rb` files in the game's `Scripts` directory.

The final fight of each Battle Tower set is against an NPC boss. Note the opponents' *default* fields can be overwritten if the random field option is on. Here are the boss battles for singles:

Theme Teams allows you to fight the game's NPCs with specific themed teams - beating them (except Julia's "Kaboom" team) will award you *4 BP*.

Mix N' Match allows you to do 2v2 fights of these NPC teams: you get to pick a partner and fight two selected opponents. Note that you can only select partners with which you have a certain amount of relationship points with. Every Mix N' Match fight awards *4 BP*, though choosing random partner/enemies will award *8 BP* instead.

*Note that certain trainers will not be available during certain story events for Theme Teams and Mix N' Match*. Regardless, listed in full, the pool of Theme Teams and Mix N' Match trainers is as follows:

## Vanhanen Castle New World

On the right side of the room, talk to Cass.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Cass you aren't ready to start your first postgame quest repeatedly (-1 Noel, -1 Serra)

She will give us our first of many legendary quests: we're wanted in Vanhanen Castle!

Fly over to Vanhanen Castle and go in. Where we once fought Cain, you'll see a New World Door on the second level. Head in.

Our first Anomaly battle! Note that this another fight on the New World field. The first four Pokemon use this field beneficially to some extent, but Ice and field-boosted Dark moves can generally shut them down. The first Cresselia will always use Lunar Dance, sacrificing itself to give an omniboost to the second Cresselia. Note the Magical Seed, meaning the second Cresselia will always get two omniboosts, but will need to recharge on the first turn it is out. That means you can use Toxic, Psych Up, Haze, Trick Room, etc. for free and whittle it down with the remainder of your team.

Once you win, you'll be immediately thrown into a battle with a wild **Cresselia**, which you can now catch. Don't worry, this fight is much easier than the previous, you just have to catch it. It's worth noting that you can often mash the auto-save key (default 'D') between the Anomaly battle and the legendary fight if you want. You can also grind the Nightclub facilities to get Reborn Balls if catching the legendaries is too much of a pain.

Luna will give us the *Gather Cube* afterwards.

Return to the Nightclub!

While you're here, more NPC's will have returned to the nightclub. In particular, you can show Florinia the Naganadel we got earlier (or other Ultra Beasts we'll find later) to get 5 *Beast Balls*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Show Florinia an Ultra Beast (+1 Florinia)

That's it for the first Postgame Episode!

# Postgame Episode 2: Fetch, Doggy!

Time for some more legendary quests. Note that your level cap has silently gone up to Lv. 110. Note that within each section, these quests can be done in any order, so feel free to bounce around if you'd like.

## Fetching the Legendary Birds

Talk to Cass behind the counter once more. She'll tell us about three birds that we have to find in thematically-relevant locations. Hmm...

Fly over to Ametrine City, then climb the mountain. Where we once fought Blake, you can fight and catch **Articuno**.

Fly over to Beryl Ward, and go across the bridge to the east. In the factory where Shade once was, we can catch **Zapdos**.

Finally, fly over to Apophyll Academy, and climb Pyrous Mountain. At the top of the volcano is **Moltres**.

As of Gen VII, 9.6% of all Pokemon were legendaries... too many, perhaps, GF? Anyways, that's why not every quest could realistically be a huge affair. There are fantastic quests are still to come.

Return to the Nightclub. If you want, get Articuno out of the PC and talk to Lumi a few times.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Show Lumi your Articuno (+1 Lumi)

## Fetching the Lake Spirits

Back in the Nightclub, talk to Seacrest. He will tell us that the Lake Spirits, fittingly, can be found in and around the lake.

Fly to Coral Ward, then go west. Head left at the fork, then follow the rocks along the bottom left and down until you reach a sandbank - inside is the *Fairview Apartments*. Go right, dive down, go up, then surface. You'll find **Azelf** chilling at the top.

From here, retrace your steps until you reach the sandbar. From here, go straight up and hug the left wall until you reach another sandbar, then go left towards the *Sunrise Apartments*. Dive down here, go up, surface, go up and left, cross the sand, and dive down once more. You'll find **Uxie** in the top right corner.

Surface, and fly to Apophyll Academy. From here, follow the path up towards the Apophyll Cave, surfing up and following the small path right towards the dive spot and *Kingsbury Apartments*. Dive down. A bit down and right from the top left corner is a small 2x2 spot to surface - do so here. Enter Apophyll Cave. You'll need to freeze the water here in a battle by using Blizzard or Subzero Slammer. Enter the cave up and to the left to find **Mesprit**!

## Route 1 New World

Head back to the Nightclub. Talk to Randall this time and get the quest to visit Route 1 next.

Fly over to the Route 1 Nature Center, and talk to Sandy outside. We are looking for three anomalies. The first is actually on the roof of this building, so climb the stairs inside and enter.

Another 8-turn Trick Room oriented New World team. This time Aromatisse has a Sash, so OHKO'ing it is not an option. Thankfully, it is the only Trick Room user. Ursaring, Primarina, and especially Mega Camerupt are extremely strong under the Trick Room, so stalling it out may be ideal. Entei is last and is actually fast, so watch out for that. Speedy power should be able to take care of the majority of the team after Trick Room, then a bulky Rock/Ground type can handle Entei.

You can catch **Entei** afterwards.

Return to Route 1, and take a Tauros to the east. If you haven't solved the [South Aventurine Woods](#south-aventurine-woods-exploration) puzzles... you'll have to now. 

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_7.png"/>

Anyways, use a Tauros to follow the long path (beginning in "3S" and going east) in South Aventurine Woods to the southeast, where you'll find a New World Door.

Don't worry: not all Anomalies will be on New World. Not that that makes this fight any better. All six Pokemon have Elemental Seeds, granting SpD and Aqua Ring. The team is particularly bulky, sporting all kinds of Def/SpD boosting moves, healing moves, Toxic, etc. Goodra serves as a blocker to Electric and Grass moves, too. If you are able to turn the field to Murkwater, they can't change it back, meaning all their Elemental Seeds will now Poison them, making their stall strategies much less effective. You can also use a set-up sweeper of some kind that uses Water type's weaknesses, as long as you have a strategy for Ludicolo and Goodra.

Once you win, you'll be able to battle and catch **Suicune**. Return to Route 1. 

If you haven't done [North Aventurine Woods](#north-aventurine-woods-exploration) puzzles, you'll need to now. 

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/route1_8.png"/>

Towards the east side of Route 1, grab a Tauros and enter the fourth entrance (4N) to North Aventurine Woods. There's a ledge right and up you can climb to reach a New World Door.

Rotom will usually use its Z-Move to transform the field to Snowy Mountain. You can dampen the team's strategies somewhat by preventing this from happening by OHKO'ing Rotom, if you want. These two field effects are pretty stacked, damage-wise, so read up on the Field Manual if you're stuck on it. Trick Room can also help out here, preventing Sandslash and Raikou from going on killing streaks.

Once you win, you can battle and catch **Raikou**.

Return to the Nightclub once you're done.

## Route 2 New World

Back in the Nightclub, talk to Zero and accept his quest. Fly over to the Celestinine Cascade and go right onto Route 2. If the leftmost Crustle is still in the way, climb some nearby rocks to get some Red Powder, then remove the Crustle. Enter this cave and the New World Door.

Talk to Amaria inside to the right. You'll need to find someone who can read Braille to help.

Fly over to Coral Ward, and enter the apartment on the upper side. Talk to Danielle inside, who will agree to meet you in the Route 2 New World.

Talk to her, and we'll have to play Simon Says. Follow the instructions that "Simon" says precisely, and a new door will open. Follow it.

This team generally relies upon Stakataka's Trick Room, which can be shut down by OHKO'ing it. The move Earth Power can do the trick. Regirock and Regice eat up Physical and Special moves, and hold a Band and Specs, respectively. Registeel gets an Omniboost with its seed and will try to stall you out with Toxic and Seismic Toss. The Tyranitar is a special set, benefitting from the field effect with most of its moves, and Mega Mawile rounds out the team with very strong Sucker Punch, potentially boosted by Power-Up-Punch. If you can take out the Trick Room, set up a Sweeper (ideally with a Fighting type move), and have a plan to deal with Sucker Punch, you're golden.

With that out of the way, we'll be free to explore from here in three directions. I start by going left. Talk to the braille tablet here, then to Danielle when you're ready. Time for more Simon Says. Note that you will have to move yourself to move the boulders as instructed - this is ok and won't ruin your attempt. Enter the opened door, where you can find and catch **Regirock**.

Back out in the main room, go up at the fork. Talk to the Braille, then Danielle to get instructions. Here, we'll have to do 5 slides across the ice to break all five tiles, but never stepping over one incorrectly. We need to slide: Left, Right, Left, Up, Right. The key here is that you can slide on the other spots of ice just as long as you don't hit the same spot twice. With the ice spots numbered 1-5, top to bottom:

- Go left to break 2
- Go right to break 3
- Go left to break 1, then go up, right, down to sneak your way back to the right side of the ice
- Go up to break 4, then go right, down, left across the ice, down across the ice.
- From here, go right to break 5.

Head in to catch **Regice**.

Make your way to the right side of the main room now, talk to the Braille once more. Danielle will make us play Danielle Says this time. Ignore her when Simon says, but listen when Danielle says. Once you succeed, head through the door to catch **Registeel**!

Make your way out of the New World.

# Postgame Episode 3: The Umbral Issue

Back in the Nightclub, there are new quests we can pursue. The level cap has also been raised to Lv. 115.

## Route 3 New World

Talk to Sandy and accept her quest to check out Route 3.

Fly over to Calcenon, then go down the stairs and right onto the route. Head east and into the first cave, where you'll find a New World Door.

Head up and talk to the Ringmaster. Once Virizion runs off, follow it left. You'll be attacked with gusts of wind, so it might be smart to turn off super speed. Once Virizion runs off again, the gusts will stop.

Ringmaster Alistasia will be your ally, meaning you do have a numbers advantage in this one. If you can keep her Primarina alive and give it Trick Room support, it can fairly easily deal with Cobalion's trio. Focus on knocking these out first since alone the Silvally trio is not very threatening.

With the battle done, two of the three will run off to allow you to catch them. **Virizion** can be caught to the left in the grassy area. On the right side of the area, you'll find **Cobalion**.

Head outside of the New World. Make your way through the Route 3 Cave system towards the LCCC. In the Sapphire Cave you'll find **Terrakion** up some rocks.

But wait, there's more! Return to the New World Door in the Ruby Cave and talk to the Ringmaster at the top of the area. Head in to the next area.

We once had an optional Victoria battle on Ashen Beach, then the Kiki fight. One of the Victory Road spirits battled on it too, but this is the fourth significant battle in the whole game here. May take a bit of time to get used to it again!

Anyways, this is the hardest fight in the Postgame so far. 12 Pokemon that are all threats, inherently or because of the field, against you and an ally that loves to make terrible decisions sometimes (COME ON PRIMARINA TARGET KELDEO IT'S THE OBVIOUS THREAT). You have to have some kind of plan for the opener: Weavile uses Beat Up on Cobalion, granting it +5 attack by the turn's end. Not good. On top of that, all the field boosted mud attacks, Surf, and Focus Blast will deal heavy damage. I recommend first stopping Weavile, getting up Trick Room and doing everything in your power to defeat the right side first, then hoping you end up in a position where Alistasia's Hawlucha is alive, since it can OHKO all three of the Swords of Justice and Mega Lucario. Psychic moves are generally good here - boosted Calm Mind and Psychic with speed support may be one way to sweep. 

Afterwards, you'll be able to battle and catch **Keldeo**! Thankfully your team will be healed beforehand.

If you refused to give Blake the Ruby Ring, you'll have another fight now.

An interesting team for Samson, focusing this time on feminity in particular. Be careful of the numerous Focus Blasts, particularly on his Ultra Beast Pheromosa, which can easily set up on you. Lots of speed here so as usual I will suggest Trick Room.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- After refusing to give Blake the ring, defeat Umbral Samson (+1 Samson)

Accept Alistasia's offer to return to the Nightclub.

## Route 4 New World

Talk to Aster and accept his quest to head over to Route 4 via Calcenon City. 

### Purple Zone

Climb the rocks, then at the fork go up. Go left from here to find a New World Door.

The lower floor looks like this:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/nw4_purple_lower.png"/>

And the upper floor looks like this:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/nw4_purple_upper.png"/>

Follow the path up, and down, taking ladders A, B, C, D. From above, you'll see light bridges shining from the level down below - keep track of where these are. Once you go down the fourth ladder (D), you'll need to hop across to the north, then follow the path. Use the first invisible bridge right, down, and left to continue.

You'll reach a fork here: go to the left, follow the ladders E, F, G up and down, then interact with the orb.

Backtrack to the fork, this time, going across the narrow path on the bottom right. Traverse two ladders H, I. Here, hug the right wall and follow the green path right to reach:

**ZCell 03: New World (Route 4)**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_03.jpg"/>

Continue following the path from here, hopping to the north and traversing ladders J, K. You'll reach what appears to be a dead end: there is an invisible bridge on the right side that will bring us back to a landmass with two ladders (B, C) we visited previously. Take the bottom ladder (B, then A) and follow the path to exit this section of the New World.

### Gray Zone

Back on Route 4, make your way past the first lake map, on route to the Glass Workstation, but go right on the next map instead, down the rocks. You'll see another New World Door, so head in.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/nw4_grey.png"/>

Follow the path, then climb the ladder L. It will take you up to see some light bridges below - note these, then head back down and follow the light bridge to the left. Continue following the light bridges in the bottom right side of the area. Climb the next ladder (M) to note some more light bridges near the entrance that we didn't see before.

Head all the way back to nearby the New World Door, and go left across the invisible bridge. Going up the next ladder (N) will give you more information about light bridges: follow the path across invisible bridge after invisible bridge from here, hopping across to other landmasses when necessary. Eventually you'll reach a ladder (O), where you can find another orb! You can now hop up from here and go left to reach a warp that will take you back to the New World Door.

### Blue Zone

Back on Route 4, make your way to the map containing the Glass Workstation. Surf on the lake, and take the waterfall at the bottom of the map. Enter the New World Door on this next map.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/nw4_blue.png"/>

This map is the simplest of the three: use the two ladders (P, Q) to discover light bridges below that you can use to reach the top right ladder (R). Talk to the third orb!

Head up, and cross the bridge to the right. You'll now notice hop platforms going up from here, so follow this path up when you're ready.

Trick Room + Ice Move = Profit.

Once you defeat this team, the three will split up. Hopping across the rocks in all three directions, you can catch **Tornadus**, **Thundurus**, and **Landorus**.

Once you're done and try to head out of this area, if you gave Blake the Ruby Ring, you'll have a battle here.

Ciel uses a team full of Flying types on New World Field, meaning they'll all have a speed advantage over grounded Pokemon but have weakened defenses. Celesteela will probably give you flashbacks to the Lin fight - it's as cruel as ever, this time with a Magical Seed to really amplify the Beast Boost shenanigans. With a Special Landorus Set, mega Pinsir with Priority, boosted Darkinium-Z Zapdos, and more... this is a tough team. I recommend abusing Power Gem / Rockinium-Z boosts, Magical Seeds of your own, and Trick Room for this one.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- After giving Blake the ring, defeat Umbral Ciel (+1 Ciel)

Head down from here, use the warp, and return to the Nightclub.

## Chrysolia Deepwoods

Talk to Nyu in the Nightclub and accept his quest.

Fly over to Spinel Town, then make your way to the train in the south side of the Chrysolia Forest. Enter the New World Door to the right.

Once you've finished exploring the woods, head to the large structure in the center.

Follow the arrows to the statue to the right and press the button. Talk to Smeargle. He was kind enough to write instructions for us in this next area! How nice. Essentially, you'll need follow the numbered instructions one by one in this area. Note that once you complete the first 6 steps you can go to the far top right corner and grab the *Reveal Glass*.

Once you succeed at solving Smeargle's helpful instructions, enter the New World Door at the top. Hug the right wall as you proceed.

This one isn't too bad really, again it's a Trick Room Team that relies entirely upon it's lead, meaning if you can prevent Trick Room, cancel it out, or stall it out, you'll be just fine. Everything is weak to Fighting type moves, too!

Afterwards, you'll be challenged to a battle, where you can catch **Regigigas**. Head out once you're done...

## Umbral Battle at Vanhanen Castle

Your level cap is now Lv. 120, by the way.

Back in the Nightclub, talk to Seacrest, and accept the quest. Head over to Vanhanen Castle when you're ready... Oh boy.

12V6 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

So yeah this one is really hard. Two megas! Two entire teams that are specifically designed with basically the best candidates for every chess piece, including the best non-legendary Pokemon in the game in Aegislash! It's just... brutal. Even if you go for Stomping Tantrum or Tectonic Rage to destroy the board... you're still stuck fighting all of these guys. Trying Trick Room? Aegislash, Aggron, and Escavalier are slow, while Kartana and Lopunny are super fast.

Anyways, I think there are two strategies to consider. The first, while not that simple as mentioned earlier, is simply to smash the field and just overwhelm your opponents with a very well prepared doubles team. Setting up a sweeper or two with speed and good coverage can be difficult to pull off, but can make it work. A lot of the team relies on Physical moves this time, so if you can deal with Kartana's Brick Break, Reflect can be helpful here.

Alternatively, you can try to use the Chess Board to your own benefit. Having two pawns means you get free Focus Sashes to try to develop some momentum, though Cloyster's multi-hit moves do make this difficult. Setting up a good hard-hitting King via the King's Rock can be crucial, especially if they are on the slower side.

Either approach may yield you results but don't be afraid to try, try again, try again more times, cry, and try again. Eventually you'll probably succeed.

Accept the warp once you win back to the Nightclub. That's it for this section.

# Postgame Episode 4: Across Space & Time

Back in the Nightclub, we can pick from a large number of quests.

## Twilight Desert (Part 1)

First, talk to Marcello on the left for a new quest. He'll also sell us some Lemonade!

<div class="shop_section"><table>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Blue Moon Lemonade</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center">$100000000</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

We actually can't progress to the end of postgame without buying a Blue Moon.... just kidding.

Make your way to the Grandview Station, then head to the desert. As soon as you get off the train, go up a few tiles from the train station then go straight to the right. You'll find a New World Door!

This map actually loops back onto itself from its west and east ends, so is a bit tricky to navigate. The map above should help you get a feel for which parts of the map connect. Hope you like Zygarde Cells, by the way. If you don't care about collecting them, you can just go straight up in this area.

Start by going straight to the left (path 5), hugging the bottom wall. You'll eventually find:

**ZCell 05: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_05.jpg"/>

Make your way back to the entrance area, and go up into the next horizontal section. Go right, then down and left (path 6) to reach:

**ZCell 06: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_06.jpg"/>

Make your way back to the "middle" of the map, and go up into the next horizontal section once more. To your right is a narrow pathway, but it leads to a dead end. Instead, go slightly up and follow the path (7) left. You'll see two cells we can't get quite yet - keep following the path left for now. Eventually, you'll reach:

**ZCell 07: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_07.jpg"/>

Backtrack all the way to just southeast of the two cells separated by the palm tree above. Go up to the next horizontal section (follow path 8). Left from here, you'll find:

**ZCell 08: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_08.jpg"/>

Next, go straight to the right, and follow the twisting path (9) to the right. You'll eventually reach the other cell we saw earlier:

**ZCell 09: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_09.jpg"/>

Head all the way back to the middle. Hopefully we're starting to understand how this area works! Go up then left (path 10):

**ZCell 10: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_10.jpg"/>

Going all the way right (path 11) will lead you to:

**ZCell 11: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_11.jpg"/>

Back in the middle, climb the first set of dunes to go up a tier, but don't climb up the second quite yet. Follow the narrow path (12) to the right to:

**ZCell 12: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_12.jpg"/>

Back at the fork, climb the final set of dunes. Going up from here, you'll see a large structure. Start by going to the left (path 13). You'll see a lever (A) at the top of some stairs - pull it. Head left from here, and you'll find:

**ZCell 13: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_13.jpg"/>

From here, continue going around the loop until you see an open door up some stairs (gamma). Head in. Inside, you'll find two screens. Talk to each screen, then head back out.

Go left from here, and you'll find a path up that leads to another lever (B) and a door (beta). The door is currently a dead end, so pull the lever, then left once more. Pull the first lever (A) once more, then go left again. Enter the now-open door (delta) that you'll see. Talk to the green machine on the left to get:

**ZCell 14: Twilight Desert**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_14.jpg"/>

Talk to the machine on the right, and you'll be able to merge ten of the cells we've found so far into **Zygarde 10%**. You can deconstruct this Zygarde, if you want.

Head outside, and go to the right. Past the first lever, there will be a new opened door (alpha, above). One of the monitors in here will give you as many Zygarde Cells as you've found so far in *Cell Imprints*, the game's ONLY way of increasing IV's on our Pokemon. As you might guess, the Cells are limited in total number, so be sure when you use these on your Pokemon. You can come back here anytime to get more as you get more Cells. Anyways, talk to the other machine then head back outside.

From here, go right, then up. Enter the door here (beta). The gate inside is now gone, so you can head up. Talk to Florinia.

That's all we have to do here for now. If you pull the first lever outside to the left (A), the stairs to the left that lead into a room we previously checked out (gamma) will reappear. Inside, you can trade Cell Imprints for *Negative Imprints*, which instead turn an IV to 0. Helpful for maximizing a Trick Room or Gyro Ball user's effectiveness.

Feel free to return for more Cell and Negative Imprints when you need to, but for now return to the Nightclub!

## Anomaly at Chrysolia Springs

Talk to your gang leader on the right side, and they'll tell you about something going down at the Chrysolia Springs. Head over to Spinel Town, make your way into the forest, then enter the Springs on the left side.

Surf across, push the boulder out of the way, then jump down to the basement floor. Head up once you're ready!

Another anomaly fight. Field boosted Steam Eruption, Heat Wave, Surf, etc. can all be potentially deadly, so watch out for those.

After winning, you'll be able to fight **Volcanion**. Exit and return to the Nightclub once you're done.

## Chrysolia Deepwoods Poachers

Next, talk to Smeargle to get a new quest. Head outside and talk to Arclight, then fly over to Spinel Town. Enter the forest and enter the Lost Railcave in the bottom-right corner.

In each room, enter the door that has two rocks closest to it. Eventually you will reach a room containing Arclight. After the conversation, enter the New World Door in the next path.

Make your way to the top right side of the area. By going behind the tree, you'll be able to sneak around the top of the map to the top left corner. Follow this path there then all the way down to the bottom left side to reach:

**ZCell 15: New World (Chrysolia Railcave)**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_15.jpg"/>

Back in the center, climb the stairs on the hill and interact with the tall pillar at the top of the hill to create some electric platforms at the bottom right. If you're on Lin Route, you'll get taunted as you activate the pillars. Anyways, follow the new path.

Activate pillars on these islands, then follow the paths they create. One of the islands towards the bottom has a *Max Repel* on it. Eventually you'll have to backtrack to reach the next set of electric platforms, proceed to the left once you backtrack enough.

On Lin Route, you'll be given a prompt to release some of your Pokemon. This event is huge and branching... but aside from tons of great dialogue, the only thing that 'matters' aside from your morals is that if you release a lot of Pokemon, you'll get a *Sacred Ash*. You can back out of the PC a bunch of times if you don't want to release anything.

Once the pillar is activated, cross the bridge to the right, then again to a new landmass. In the top right, corner, you can find:

**ZCell 16: New World (Chrysolia Railcave)**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_16.jpg"/>

Enter the New World Door at the bottom to return to the Chrysolia Deepwoods. Talk to Arclight here, then make your way through the Deepwoods to defeat the poachers. Arclight will heal you, if you need it. The first is up from Arclight:

Nothing too crazy here, though there is a good mix of fast and slow, bulky and hard-hitting. Once you win, talk to **Zeraora** to obtain it! Accept the fast travel back to the Nightclub.

## Aegir Cave

Talk to Randall in the Nightclub, and accept his quest. Fly over to the Victory Road Pokemon Center.

Enter Victory Road, then follow Victini up. Enter the room directly up, and follow Bennett into the next room... I audibly gasped when I saw what was next.

Another LOGIC PUZZLE! As always, I will recommend using the <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">spreadsheet</a>.

The clues:

1. No two crystals share any same quality.
2. The Purity of the 'Coxcomb' gem is less than the Purity of the 'Miniscule' gem, which is less than the Purity of the 'Vitreous' gem.
3. The Hardness of the 'Eminent' gem is less than the Hardness of the 'Perfect' gem, which is less than the Hardness of the 'Cubic' gem.
4. The Purity of the gem with a Hardness of 5 is less than the Purity of the gem with 'Perfect' Foliation, which is less than the Purity of the 'Pearly' gem.
5. The Luster of the 'Tabular' gem is less than the luster of the 'Cubic' gem, which is less than the Luster of the gem with 'Indistinct' Foliation.
6. The Size of the 'Coxcomb' gem is less than the Size of the 'Indistinct' gem, which is less than the Size of the gem with a Hardness of 8.
7. The Foliation of the 'Hexagonal' gem is less than the Foliation of the 'Large' gem, which is less than the Foliation of the gem with a Hardness of 7.
8. The Habit of the 'Flawless' gem is less than the Habit of the 'Pearly' gem, which is less than the Habit of the 'Silky' gem.

You'll also notice that there are rocks on some of the tracks for the gems: this provides us more information for our puzzle. I have blocked out the corresponding spaces in the spreadsheet.

The solution:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/vr_puzzle_5.jpg"/>

Bennett will just do it for you if you fail too many times.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Solve Logic Puzzle 5 in five or fewer tries (+1 Bennett)

Once you succeed, head up. Grab the hidden *Exp. Candy XL* and proceed. Enter the New World Door.

Head to the left and talk to Bennett and Serra. Bennett will ask us to gather 7 ingredients: Sweet Apple, Tart Apple, Balm Mushroom, Pecha Berry, Berry Juice, Stick, and Rage Powder. He'll also offer to teach Headbutt to one of our Pokemon, if we need it.

Time to wander around the area looking for these things. On this floor you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Net Ball*, and *Ability Capsule*. Start by jumping into the hole towards the left side, down a muddy slope. On this bottom level, you can talk to a tree to get the *Sweet Apple*.

Jump down the muddy slope to the left. Towards the top of this area, hop across the pillars to get a hidden *Blue Shard*, *Stardust*, and *Full Heal*. You can also grab the *Tart Apple* in a nearby tree. Backtrack to the left side of the lake, and go down to find a hidden *Ultra Ball*. Going to the right past some trees will lead us to red trees where we can grab some *Rage Powder*. Climb the ladder to the left.

Back on the upper level, go up to find a hidden *Pecha Berry* in a rock. You can also steal them from wild Wurmple if you lose this one, somehow. On the bottom right of this area are some pillars, leading to a hidden *Dusk Ball* as well as:

**ZCell 17: Aegir Cave**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_17.jpg"/>

Return to the bottom floor and take the ladder up, in the top left. Make your way back to Bennett, then jump in the hole above him. Grab the *Ultra Ball*, then climb down the rocks and get onto the water. Grab the hidden *Nugget* below the pillars, as well as:

**ZCell 18: Aegir Cave**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_18.jpg"/>

Hop down the mudslide then return to the upper level. All the way in the bottom right corner, you can jump across a stone and into a hole. Climb the waterfall to reach:

**ZCell 19: Aegir Cave**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_19.jpg"/>

Head back down and dive.

You'll find a hidden *Max Repel*, *Super Potion*, and *Net Ball* down here. Surface at the end, grabbing the hidden *Berry Juice* in this room. You can steal these from wild Shuckle if you lose this one.

Exit from here at the bottom, grab the hidden *Dusk Ball*, and hop down onto the lake. Pick up the *Ultra Ball* in the middle of the lake, then climb the waterfall at the top of the area. Inside the cave is a *Balm Mushroom*.

Back down on the large lake, dive down. You'll be able to find a hidden *Blue Shard*, *Rawst Berry*, *Exp. Candy XL*, and *Elixir*. Enter the cave here to find:

**ZCell 20: Aegir Cave**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_20.jpg"/>

Surface, then talk to Serra near the bottom of the lake. Head right and climb the ladder. Back on the upper level, go to the top right corner and use the ladder here to reach a *Stick*. That's all the ingredients, so return to Bennett. Once you're ready, talk to **Victini** for a battle!

Agree to walk back with them.

## Agate Circus Ferris Wheel

Talk to Cass in the Nightclub, then fly over to the Agate Circus. The Ferris Wheel area is finally open, so make your way there.

Grab the hidden *Beast Ball* to the left.

You can buy a couple more of these to make bagging the Ultra Beasts easier, if you want.

Once the crowd clears, you can pick up a hidden *Full Restore* and *Purple Shard*. Talk to the ringmaster to get signed up for the tournament, then talk to the clowns when you're ready. It's a 3v3 tournament on random fields.

This one is surprisingly tough. Even with a field effect that is beneficial, you still have to contend with the raw power of Magnezone, easy boosting potential of Magearna, and especially the absolute unit that is CL:4R1-C3 Breloom. Consider setting up on Magnezone somehow in order to oneshot the latter two. You can always save and reset for a more beneficial field, in a pinch.

Shouldn't be too ridiculous as long as you're aware of the horrors these three are capable of.

Finally, the last match is with Cass. If we pet Glaceon way back in the glass workstation, we will get to fight the first team:

Another 12v6. Oh boy. Although the field is random, there is a good chance that one of the Malamars will try to use Topsy-Turvy, transforming the field into Inverse Field. Just like on New World, that will activate all of the Magical Seeds, turning them into omniboosts. They have lots of coverage in the types made extra good on this field - Ice, Bug, etc., which means you'll be taking a lot of damage real fast. Either you can try to roll with this field, bringing moves that will be able to hit super effectively on Inverse and using seed omniboosts, or you can suppress it by knocking out both Malamar's before it's too late. This can be especially beneficial if you end up on a field effect that your team likes and you want to preserve it - in a worst case scenario, you can always reset until you get a good one for your team. 

Head back to the Nightclub!

## Manyworld Forest

Next, we're going to talk to Simon. He'll tell us about something happening in Agate City, so fly on over there. Dive down to reach the area where Lin got her Relic Stone, then enter the New World Door.

This map is huge but mostly empty. Make your way to the bottom left corner to find:

**ZCell 22: Manyworld Forest**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_22.jpg"/>

Towards the top of the area, you'll be able to hop across some space platforms. In the center only on Anna Route, you'll find a *Fresh Water*. Don't waste it. Go to the left to find:

**ZCell 23: Manyworld Forest**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_23.jpg"/>

Down from here, you can hop across some platforms to grab the *Tapunium-Z*. Back up from here, you'll occasionally see a moving platform. Use it to reach a *Sacred Ash* at the top. Go back to the center.

Going as far to the right as possible, you'll be able to ride another moving platform to reach:

**ZCell 24: Manyworld Forest**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_24.jpg"/>

Back in the middle, go up. On Lin Route, now you'll get a *Fresh Water*. Pour the Fresh Water onto the Celebi.

Climb through the New World Door to emerge next to the Pokemon League. If Taka is currently alive for you, he'll be here, otherwise it will be Elias. Whomever is here will give you another *Fresh Water*. Prepare your best team, stock up on healing items, etc. as if you were locking yourself into an Elite Four challenge. Don't be afraid to eat a loss and change up your team if one of the following battles is too much for now.

Give the Fresh Water to Celebi. In the past, talk to Taube at the top for a battle.

A bunch of illegal Celebi on the most broken field in the game. Joy. Plus, the first Celebi in particular is extremely annoying, with speedy Spore and moves to boost and grow the field. That said, you still are facing six Pokemon with the exact same weaknesses, including a double weakness to Bug. A Chesto Berry to deal with Spore, a speed boosting move, and a strong Bug type move like TM X-Scissor are pretty much all you'll need!

Talk to Celebi to jump into the future.

Very similar to Heather's Elite Four battle, Elena also uses the Mountain Field and Tailwind to set up Strong Winds, neutralizing Flying's weaknesses. Dragonite likes to set screens - on top of Multiscale, this makes it annoyingly tanky, so consider Brick Break for this fight. Trick Room is good as usual, and turning the field into a Snowy Mountain can allow you to overpower with Ice moves. Just watch out for Marowak in both cases. Anyways, lots of options to win this one.

Talk to Celebi to proceed to the next area.

I wonder if Amethyst likes Alolan Ninetales? And Fairy and Dark types? Boosted on the Starlight Arena? With the wrinkle of Mega Lopunny to consider, this shouldn't be too insane for anyone who could beat Anna earlier.

Celebi will take you ahead in time once more.

What would be a gauntlet of four trainers without healing or switching your Pokemon without a Champion fight at the end? At this point in the game, her Yanmega, Leavanny, and Primarina are nothing we can't handle. Alolan Muk gets free defenses on this field thanks to its ability, and can boost its Atk and Def further on its free first turn from seed. Then there are the two demons. Mega Scizor is, by now, at least a known demon. It can boost to +3 with Swords Dance then hit like an absolute menace with Bullet Punch. The first time we have to fight a Xerneas is here however... and there's a reason this thing is regarded as so good. If you're not careful it will get +2 in SpA, SpD, and Spe then sweep you with field boosted Moonblast and Secret Sword. Ouch!

A well chosen sweeper can deal with everything barring these two. If you're stuck on them, consider something with a Fire move for Scizor and a physical boosted Steel move for Xerneas. Using Magical Seeds on your own Pokemon will extend the "free turn" effect to them as well, so that may just be the key to overcoming Reborn's future champion.

Talk to Shelly once you're done here. You'll be taken back to your time... and you can talk to **Celebi** to take it with you! Hooray! Return to the Nightclub.

## The Train Heist

Next, talk to Zero in the Nightclub and accept his quest. Proceed to Peridot and enter the train station. Talk to Adrienn at the top of the station and state that you're ready to proceed.

After talking to the chief, feel free to talk to the other passengers of the train. Return to the chief. Once the orbs disappear, head to the front of the train. From here, we will talk to all the passengers of the train to try to solve the mystery.

Return to the chief and state that you're done with the investigation when you're ready.

You can now accuse one of the culprits. Each will battle you once accused. You can also talk to the chief multiple times to accuse them. Afterwards, you'll need to check your bag and "Use" the Blue Orb that you find inside to continue.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Accuse Julia of stealing the orbs (-1 Julia)

However, there is one more option: you can check your bag to find the Blue Orb inside *before* making any accusation: this will cause everyone to fight you in a gauntlet, with Anomaly Hoopa as your partner.

Another New World field 12v6. Joy. It's worth noting that Hoopa's team is entirely Trick Room based and slow, while Corin-Rouge's team is a bit speedier altogether. Therefore I recommend either focusing on knocking out Hoopa's team so you can run with the Trick Room yourself, or focusing on knocking out Corin-Rouge first and suppressing/reversing Trick Room whenever possible. By now we also have a lot of legendaries whose signature moves are boosted on this field and Ultra Beasts who can sweep with some momentum, so despite how stacked against you this is, we do have some tools that we can use going forward.

Jump through the portal. You'll find yourself back in the Route 4 New World - follow the path all the way to the portal up top where Corin Rouge is.

You'll next find yourself in the Vanhanen Castle New World - straight up from here is the portal. Follow the path in the New World Route 2 until the fork, then go left. Enter the door to find the next ring.

You'll find yourself now in New World Route 3. Prepare yourself, then make your way to the Keldeo beach fight area. You now get to fight:

PULSE 2 Mega Garchomp, Unaware Quagsire, and tanky Palossand are annoying as always. Ashen Beach providing boosts to Surf, Strength, and Focus Blast doesn't help. But we're a champion of beating numerous 12v6 fights by now - surely this one won't be too intense, right? Enter the next ring and follow the path. LOL!

Back in the train station, talk with the group here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Adrienn you had to bring Terra back (+1 Terra)

You'll also be given **Hoopa**! Walk on back to the nightclub.

## Aiding and Abetting Bladestar

Finally, talk to Danielle in the Nightclub and accept the quest. Head south from Obsidia Ward into Opal Ward. You'll see a few characters from Rejuvenation as a cameo here and can get a *Cotton Candy*!

Anyways, fly over to Agate and make your way to the Glass Workstation. The glass is all gone so you can easily get to the back room. Talk to the girl in here. You can choose which PULSE Machine to go to - once you do, accept the fast travel to where you fought it once upon a time. Check out all the machines that the game expects you to.

Once you emerge in Labradorra, you'll have to fight her.

No "Bewitched Field" in this game!

Once you win, she'll head to Ametrine City, so follow her and enter the former house of Lumi and Eve. After the conversation, fly on over to the Pokemon League.

I sure hope you like fighting the Elite Four, because we're about to do it again... with Flora as an ally! Each of you will get to use only 3 Pokemon per fight. In general for these fights, it may be smarter to try to support Flora than to try to do your own thing. Keep that in mind as you plan your team of six.

Our first fight against just Laura is mostly the same old shenanigans with the Flower Garden. Flora's team is benefitted by this field just as much as Laura though, so if you can identify the threats to Flora's team and focus on just them, there's a good chance Flora will do the heavy lifting here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say "You Honor Me" (+1 Elias)
- Say "Bow Before Me" (-1 Elias)

Dragonite likes to absolutely shred Flora's team with Extremespeed, so consider neutralizing it by putting it to sleep, using Reflect, etc. Otherwise it's basically Elias' old team on doubles, so you can find a way through. Dazzling Gleam is a fantastic opening move!

First time we have to fight Bennett solo since he became an Elite Four member, as well. He uses Rainbow Field, where 5 of his Pokemon get a boost to SpA and a Wish with their seeds. There are also tons of boosts to many of his moves. The field's Serene Grace effect also means that there is a high chance that Silver Wind will omniboost - if Pheromosa gets this, it's likely a game over. Flora's team being weak to Bug and Fire doesn't help.

To win, I will once again recommend Trick Room - Volcarona, Delphox, Pheromosa, Ribombee are all fast and frail, so your own slow Pokemon with Flora's Ferrothorn can potentially be key here. Other options exist too, like making it rain and sweeping with Swift Swim users, for example.

Talk to Bennett before proceeding if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett he is creepy (-1 Bennett)
- Tell Bennett he is not creepy (+2 Bennett)

Talk to Flora in front of PULSE Abra, then proceed to the room in the back. We never actually talked to the Hall of Fame machine... so now we get the chance to do so. Register your team of six!

Sweet. There's just one more thing to do - finish catching the next legendary! Fly back to Agate and make your way to the back room of the Glass Workstation.

Climb the convenient ladder to grab an *Exp. Candy XL*, then go around the right. When you're ready, head up for an Anomaly!

Good ol' Factory Field. CL:4R1-C3 Breloom is back, this time with 5 other Pokemon to support it. Ferrothorn will make your Trick Room strategy tricky though not impossible to manage, so that's not an easy one-and-done thing either. With Roserade and Cinccino granting wide coverage, and Klinklang and Magearna getting really powerful on this field, you're going to need to be careful not to be swept here. You can turn it to Short-Circuit Field if you want, or just overpower them with your own speedy team. As long as you have something that can deal with CL:4R1-C3 somehow, the rest of the team will go down to Fire, Ground, and Fighting moves.

Afterwards, you'll be able to catch **Magearna**!

Head back to the nightclub. If you talk to Eve here, you can get **Aevian Misdreavus**, a cameo from Pokemon Rejuvenation. A Leaf Stone will evolve it into **Aevian Mismagius**.

## Champion Defense

This section is entirely optional - you can skip ahead [to the next section](#postgame-episode-5-wish-upon-a-star) if you wish.

After finishing Flora's quest and talking to Eve, we can actually challenge the Reborn Elite Four anytime we wish. Notably, they have new teams! Note also that when fighting them, both sets of Pokemon are clamped to Lv. 100.

Once we finish the Four, we will actually need to *defend* our title in the Champion room. You even get to choose the format between Singles and Doubles, and even choose your own Field Effect! The possible opponents are actually just a subset of the [Theme Team trainers](#battle-pavilion-facilities) from the Battle Pavilion: Shelly, Adrienn, Fern, Charlotte, Lumi, Saphira, Titania, Bennett, Cal, Cain, Victoria, and Heather. Any team of any of these trainers may be randomly chosen, except those named "Boss Rush" or "Boss Rush 2".
# Postgame Episode 5: Wish Upon a Star

The level cap secretly has risen to Lv. 125!

## Unexplored Territory

Talk to Nyu in the Nightclub and accept his quest. Fly on over to the Agate Circus, head to Route 2, then enter the Ametrine Mountain on top. From here, surf down the waterfall into 1F. Move the boulder from below on the left side, then climb the waterfall to cross the path from above. Dive down here to reach B1F.

Once you cross the B2F ice puzzle, go to the top left corner of this room and dive down. Follow this path all the way to a New World Door!

Nothing too insane here - another Mountain Field fight. Only Cobalion and Typhlosion resist Ice on this field, so I recommend switching it to Snowy Mountain and going nuts if you get stuck.

Once you succeed, head north across the water and talk to Latias again. Essentially, the next quest will require us to build a translation key based on these orb things, scattered all around this little town. Explore every corner of this town - some are accessible only via the water, to find the way. Be sure to try to weasel your way between the rocks on the lake - there are some accessible paths you might not expect.

By the way, in the bottom left corner, you can find:

**ZCell 27: Unexplored Territory**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_27.jpg"/>

Once you've found as many translations as you can, talk to Latias to learn a list of possible emotions, in English. These include Shock, Anxiety, Grief, Sorrow, Fear, Envy, Guilt, Passion, Confidence, Emptiness, Pride, Joy, Love, Disgust, Anger, and Apathy. Essentially, we will need to talk to the Florinia's around the area, diagnose them for one of these emotions, then translate it from the English word into the "emotion" word.

The Florinia to the left of Latias, across the bridge, is the first one I was able to solve. The answer:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    ANGER, which translates to GMKR@
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #1</a>
</div>

You'll also be able to help the Florinia in the double-doored building to the right, on the second floor. The solution:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    GUILT, which translates to K=XJ7
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #2</a>
</div>

The bottom right Florinia across some water has the solution:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    SORROW, which translates to F5@@5#
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #3</a>
</div>

With all three solved, you can proceed to the next area, to the left of where Latias previously was. The cipher will remain the same, with new keys discovered in this next area.

The Florinia to the bottom right of Latias:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    JOY, which translates to %5H
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #4</a>
</div>

At the top of the large building in the top left corner, the solution:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    PASSION, which translates to YGFFX5M
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #5</a>
</div>

Return to Latias, up from here is a new path we can follow. Enter this room.

Inside this forest-like room, we can diagnose another emotion:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    FEAR, which translates to ?RG@
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #6</a>
</div>

Back outside, a new gate will open to the right. Follow it, get some new clues, and talk to her at the top to solve the final puzzle:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    LOVE, which translates to J5TR
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #7</a>
</div>

With that, Florinia will have some revelations and leave. **Latias** and **Latios** will now go with you, as well!

On Lin Route, you'll even get the chance to fast travel out of here. Somehow, return to the Nightclub.

## Aegir Cave Depths

Talk to Aster in the Nightclub and agree to the quest. Make your way through Victory Road into the Aegir Cave once more.

When you're in Aegir Cave, make your way down onto the lake and dive down. You'll see a crack of light towards the bottom, slightly right and down from the underwater cave entrance we previously entered. Enter the cave via this crack of light and surface.

Grab a hidden *Rawst Berry*, then surf to the left and climb the waterfall to reach:

**ZCell 28: Aegir Cave Depths**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_28.jpg"/>

You can also climb the rightmost waterfall by going around the rocks to get the *Prison Bottle*!

Climb down the waterfall at the bottom to descend.

Grab the hidden *Dusk Ball*, *Fairy Gem*, *Max Potion*, *Exp. Candy XL*, and *Iron* in here. Climb the ladder to the right.

This floor has a hidden *Rock Gem* and *Super Repel*. Continue up the ladder to the next floor, which contains a hidden *Full Restore*. Climb up once more to find an *Exp. Candy XL* and a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Protein*. The next floor has a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Max Repel*. Enter the New World Door at the end.

Talk to the earring at the top, then exit back to the Aegir Cave Depths once the scene occurs. Now we'll be descending, following the paths that will open up as we go.

You can get a hidden *Max Potion* and *Ultra Ball* on the top floor. The next has a hidden *Red Shard*, *Stardust*, and *Cotton Candy*. Crossing the waterfall and climbing down the ladder will lead you to a hidden *Great Ball* and:

**ZCell 29: Aegir Cave Depths**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_29.jpg"/>

Climb back up and use the ladder on the other side of the waterfall to descend. On this floor, cross the waterfall to get a *Timer Ball*. This area also contains a hidden *Heart Scale* and *Oran Berry*. The floor after this contains a hidden *Level Ball* and *Full Restore*. Back on the lowest level, you can get a hidden *Poke Ball*. Talk to our pal when you're ready for a fight.

First fight on this field in a while, but it's only a 6v6. Psh.

These two don't make up a massive team, but are quite a huge pain. Try to get rid of Diancie on the first turn: the simplest way is probably using the Steelium-Z. Afterward, two at a time, you'll have to wear down the Crystal Aegislash. Knocking down one of its defensive stats may be useful - due to its massive HP, Counter and Mirror Coat may not be as effective. Endeavor, Destiny Bond, etc. are all excellent here as well. Or, the fun way: changing the field to Cave and collapsing it!

Afterwards, you'll be able to fight and catch **Diancie**. Behind is the *Griseous Orb*, for some reason. Talk to Cain outside, then agree to escape together.

It's worth noting that now that we've gotten to fight Crystal Aegislash, two of the developers in the Grand Hall secret room have slightly updated teams.

Return to the Nightclub!

## Ametrine Core

Talk to your gang leader and accept the quest. He gives us the hint that we'll need to reach our destination by diving somewhere in Celestinine Mountain. Fly over to Route 1, get on a Tauros, and make your way to the mountain via the North Aventurine Woods, third entrance from the left. Once inside, surf to the bottom left corner and dive down. Towards the top of the underwater area, you'll see a lit up door, so head through it and surface. Enter the next room to reach the Ametrine Core.

Talk to Cal at the entrance, then surf to the right across two ponds. You'll see a Rock to Smash here (1, below), so do so. Make your way back to the center of the room and go up, talking to Cal and smashing one more rock. Up from here, you'll learn about the rules of the upcoming puzzle. 

Talk to Cal to make it hot. When it's hot, we can surf across certain ponds but are stopped by boiling water. We can also smash rocks and activate Red Crystals that break ice crystals.

Talk to Blake to make it cold. When it's cold, some ponds are turned to ice that can be slid across in certain directions, while the previously boiling ponds can now be surfed over. We can also activate Blue Crystals that create paths across lava ponds.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/core1.png"/>

To solve this room:

- While it is cold, head up and talk to the Blue Crystal (2).
- Make it hot and talk to the Red Crystal down and to the left (3).
- Next, make it cold and follow the now-opened path to the left, surf up and left, and use this Blue Crystal (4) to make a path in some lava. 
- Make it hot, surf across the pond in the bottom left corner, then activate the Red Crystal towards the bottom (5).
- Make it cold, then go to the bottom left corner and slide across the entrance sheet of ice to reach the bottom right side. Slide to the right to activate a Blue Crystal here (6), then slide back left, go up and surf, and activate another Blue Crystal(7).
- Make it hot, then go to the right across the new lava path. Up from here, activate a Red Crystal (8).
- Making it cold again, follow the path around to the bottom right corner. Slide across the ice to the top, then surf across and activate a Blue Crystal (9) up some stairs.
- Make it hot, then return to the bottom right side of the room. Cross the lava at the bottom then follow the path around the right side of the room to reach another Red Crystal (10).
- Make it cold and follow the path to the bottom right corner then head up to the top of the room. Activate a Blue Crystal (11) above the center to create a new shortcut.
- Make it hot again, then go up to the top of the room to Smash a Rock (12).
- Make it cold and activate the Red Crystal beyond the former rock (13). Finally, head left from the center, surf up, and cross two lava pools to exit at the top.

In this room, another puzzle awaits.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/core2.png"/>

- Start with hot, and activate the Red Crystal (1) to the left.
- Turn it cold and activate the Blue Crystal (2) up on the hill. Follow the new path across the lava and push the boulder to the right two tiles.
- Make it hot, then surf up, activate the Red Crystal (3), and return to the bottom.
- Make it cold and return to the previous platform. Activate the Blue Crystal (4), cross the lava, and activate the next Blue Crystal (5). 
- Make it hot and return to the upper left side of the map. Smash the rock in the middle (6) and push the boulder *exactly* one tile to the right if you want a shortcut, but be careful. Head up from here to activate a Red Crystal (7).
- Make it cold, then head to the left side of the room and follow the long path (in green) all the way around the bottom of the room to activate another Blue Crystal (8). Push the boulder below all the way left to get it out of the way, then return to the bottom of the room.
- Turn up the heat and climb down the ladder at the top!

Well, that at least explains why Blake and Cal kept talking about poisonous gases. You can blow away this field if the Poison is too much for you, but it does poison lots of your opponents too, so a Poison or Steel type might be able to stall their way to victory.

Once you win, you can catch **Heatran**!

Blow the popsicle stand and return to the Nightclub.

## Splash Grounds

Talk to the Ringmaster in the Nightclub and accept the next quest. Fly on over to the Scrapyard in the desert. Assuming you did the [Mirage Tower quest](#mirage-tower) earlier, in a traincar to the left, you'll find a warp that takes you to the Tower, so proceed there. Make your way through the tower - when you eventually come upon the "fake" exterior, you'll notice that the water now has some dive spots. Dive on down!

Grab the *Relic Copper* in the first room. There is a small door to the right of the large one - go in here. Grab the *Relic Copper* and *Relic Silver* inside. You'll also find:

**ZCell 30: Splash Zone**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_30.jpg"/>

Back in the entrance room, enter the large door, and grab another 2 *Relic Coppers* in the next. Grab the 3 *Manaphy Gems* on the dais. Use one to open the door at the top. Grab the *Relic Copper* in the next room, and start by going right at the fork. Along the way, you'll find 2 *Relic Coppers* and:

**ZCell 31: Splash Zone**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_31.jpg"/>

Follow the other path from the fork. Pick up the *Relic Copper* and proceed. You'll find a room with... 2 more *Relic Coppers* and a door to use the Manaphy Gem on.

The path from here contains a *Relic Copper* but also two *Relic Silvers*! Use the last Manaphy Gem and continue, grabbing the 3 *Relic Coppers*, *Relic Silver*, and even one *Relic Gold*! Prepare for a fight and talk to Manaphy at the top.

</table></div>

A tricky fight - one that fully utilizes the shenanigans of the Underwater Field. Essentially, it boils down to three main types of Pokemon: Dhelmise, who hits ridiculously hard and does extra damage thanks to Anchor Shot, Whirlpool, and Steelworker getting buffs; Manaphy itself, whose Hydration is always on and basically means it can stall you out with free Rest every turn, boost with Tail Glow, and sweep with boosted Water Pulse and Twinkle Tackle if needed; and "the other four" who have seeds that transform them into Water types, basically 4 balls of stats and coverage moves. These Pokemon do have lots of Electric moves to cover your own Water type shenanigans, so it won't be as easy as equipping seeds and going... probably. Heliolisk in particular is annoying, since it absorbs both Ground and Water moves (field adds the latter to the former), and hits hard and heals with Parabolic Charge.

If you want to run with the field, you can use your own Water types and carefully navigate a sweep. One alternative, fun idea is to bring a fast Flying or Water type to use Fly or Dive to bring the fight to the Water Surface, which takes away the crazy speed difference and takes away the type changes on the four. Then you can sweep more "normally" or switch again to Murkwater or Icy Field if you feel like it.

Once you win, you can catch **Manaphy**! Exit the Splash Grounds through the convenient exit that opens up!

## Tabula Rasa

Talk to Seacrest in the Nightclub and accept the quest - we're going back to Victory Road. I'll spoil a bit of the upcoming gameplay a little bit: we're going to need to be able to transform the field into the four 'canon' Terrains, so make sure you have something in your PC that can create these fields, like so:

- Electric Terrain: Stoked Sparksurfer, Ion Deluge, Plasma Fists, Electric Terrain
- Psychic Terrain: Psychic Terrain
- Grassy Terrain: Bloom Doom, Grassy Terrain
- Misty Terrain: Mist, Misty Terrain

Fly on over to Charous Hall and enter Victory Road from the back. Take the warp from Florinia's puzzle room to the hub room. We're going to need to go to each of the four rooms - I will start with Ruby once more! Thankfully we can just use the warps here to return, so take the red warp and enter the New World Door.

You'll learn about electricity sizzling through the air. Talk to the pillar in this area to fight a wild Unown - finish the battle while the field is Electric Terrain and the map will transform!

A fairly standard Electric Terrain team. Trick Room goes brrrr.

Catch **Tapu Koko** once you win!

Next is the Sapphire Room - and the schtick is the same, this time you have to transform the field into Misty Terrain.

Gengar likes to use Sludge Wave, transforming the field into Corrosive Field. This literally OHKO's Tapu Bulu as it steps onto the field. Catch **Tapu Bulu** afterwards!

Finally, go to Amethyst and transform the field to Psychic Terrain.

This is our first mandatory battle with built-in Psychic Terrain... so it's time to get used to it. Telepathy doubles speed... That's on top of massive boosts to an already great type, and Psych Up... oh god. You'll know what I mean when you see it.

Trick Room is good here as its even extended for free, so that's neat. Your own Psych Up can work wonders here if need be. Haze and Taunt can also help you keep your sanity here.

Catch **Tapu Lele** once you're done, then make your way back to the Nightclub.

## Not Truly For Children

Talk to Zero and accept the quest. Once more, make your way back down to Sigmund's body... and enter the New World Door.

This area is quite linear... and sad. Once you're back in your own skin, head up for a battle.

More Psychic Terrain? Joy. This one is honestly less bad than the previous thanks to a lack of Doubles Psych Up shenanigans, however.

Once you win, you'll be able to catch **Jirachi**.

After a small section as Siggy again, you'll find yourself in the Orphanage once more. Head upstairs and watch a small scene.

**ZCell 33: Not Truly For Children**

Approach the shining object downstairs once you're ready.

Another tricky Psychic Terrain team. His Mimikyu in particular is a huge pain thanks to its ability and Sash, so if you can save a good Z Move to eradicate it, that might be ideal. If you have something to deal with Mega Mawile a Dark type can go nuts here. Or, you can abuse boosted Hex yourself, particularly effective on top of Toxic Spikes.

Go downstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Euphie that you understand (+1 Shade)
- Tell Euphie that you don't understand (-1 Shade)

Gauntlet time.

More Psychic Terrain! At least with Euphie as a partner, he uses the Field Effect well. Anna is the real threat here - Noel doesn't get a ton out of the Field and his team is somewhat slow, so I recommend targeting Anna first overall. The Meloetta pair can be deadly, so watch out for them. Spreading status can also help Euphie sweep with Hex.

This fight is where fun comes to die! Psych Up! Serene Grace spam! And worst of all: CHANSEY. Good luck, you'll need it. Literally. I recommend trying to support Euphie's Hoopa and using Psych Up yourself.

Return to the Nightclub.

## Boss Rush

That's it for this tier of legendary quests. This section is wholly optional, so [skip ahead](#postgame-episode-6-lights-out) if you wish. In the nightclub, you'll now see another Cassbot who will mention the Boss Rush mode. You can only do this once all the boss rush trainers are present. 

The trainers you fight here consist of the [Theme Team trainers](#battle-pavilion-facilities), titled "Boss Rush". Winning the whole challenge will net you *250 BP*! You'll also unlock a harder boss rush difficulty, where you fight the teams titled "Boss Rush 2". Completing this harder difficulty will net you *500 BP*!!

# Postgame Episode 6: Lights Out

Rejoice, for the Level Cap is now Lv. 130!

## Triskeline Toybox

Accept Randall's quest. Fly over to the Tanzan Cove and enter the Tanzan Mountain. Enter the room on the west side of the mountain and follow (the path onto the Wasteland Wall)[#blast-powder-and-crystal-key-goodies]. Proceed through the strength puzzles and enter the room hidden behind the blue canister on the right once you're prepared for a fight.

Fern finally replaces his annoying Roserade... with a Buzzwole! Is that fitting or what! Speaking of, Buzzwole can go on a rampage with Power-Up Punch on top of Beast Boost, so watch out for that. Otherwise, it's same ol' Fern doing the same ol' Fern things.

Enter the New World Door once you beat him.

Welcome to the Triskeline Toybox. Jump across the pink balls to the next area. 

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/toybox.png"/>

Head up three sets of stairs from here to find:

**ZCell 34: Triskeline Toybox**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_34.jpg"/>

You can actually open the two pink-and-blue chests to the left to get 3 *EV Boosters* and an *Ability Capsule*. Head up another set of stairs to open 2 more chests, containing a *Jolly Mint* and a *Timid Mint*. Down and right from here you can open 2 more chests to get a *PP All* and the *Mewnium-Z*. To the right:

**ZCell 35: Triskeline Toybox**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_35.jpg"/>

Down from here, hop across the pink balls to reach:

**ZCell 36: Triskeline Toybox**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_36.jpg"/>

Hop to the left, make your way to the bottom left corner, and hop to the left once more. Follow this path.

**ZCell 37: Triskeline Toybox**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_37.jpg"/>

Snorlax and Charizard block two of the chests, but you can open the one on the left to get 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Head up from here:

**ZCell 38: Triskeline Toybox**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_38.jpg"/>

Open the chest to the right to find 8 *Glitter Balls*. Go down the stairs below and go right to open another chest, containing an *EV Tuner*. Climb back up the stairs to the left and hop across the pink balls:

**ZCell 39: Triskeline Toybox**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_39.jpg"/>

Hop across to the right, then go down and left. You'll see a Lapras plush: hop up from here.

A decently tough fight on the Starlight Arena, but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle.

We'll need to chase Mew around after this. 

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/toybox.png"/>

You can first find it in the bottom left side of the area, disguised as Cubone (A, above). Next, you'll find it disguised as the middle of three Jigglypuff on the right side of the area (B). Next is as a Chikorita on a table near the entrance (C). Finally, return to where we fought the Anomaly and talk to Mew once more. Go through the New World Door!

In this cave, you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, *Red Hots*, *Ultra Ball*, *Ultra Potion*, and *Exp. Candy XL*. Halfway up the stairs, follow the path to a hidden *Dusk Ball* and:

**ZCell 40: Chrysolia Deepwoods Cave**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_40.jpg"/>

Follow the path out of the cave and into the Deepwoods. Grab a hidden *Normal Gem* and hop down the ledge. Cross the bridge to the left, and Fern will get trapped in a cage. Down at the lever above the cage:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Let Fern out right away (+1 Fern)
- Make Fern beg once, then let him out (-1 Fern)
- Make Fern beg twice, then let him out (-2 Fern)
- Make Fern beg three times, then let him out (-3 Fern)
- Make Fern beg four times, then let him out (-6 Fern)

That's all we can do in the Mew/Mewtwo quest for now. Accept the fast travel request to return to the Nightclub.

## The Return of Kiki?

Accept Simon's quest and fly over to Apophyll Academy. Talk to Victoria in the courtyard. We'll need to talk to various people in the courtyard that she points out, and battle them. Talk to the guy in the center a few times.

A tough fight on the Ashen Beach field. Suicune has double-strength Calm Mind with Rest, so will try to sweep you. Mega Gallade is absurdly powerful as well. Garchomp, Sniper Kingdra, and Palossand are each threatening in their own way. Finally, Marshadow is in the back, prepared to steal your stat boosts, use its Z-Move, and sweep. If you're struggling on this one, I recommend baiting out a heal from Suicune and setting up a physical sweeper in the meantime. Even with one or two Calm Minds, its moves don't have that much Base Power, so you might be able to set up and 2HKO Suicune and snowball into a sweep.

Head into the back room once you're done and catch **Marshadow**! Return to the Nightclub.

## Neo Blacksteam Fabrication

Talk to Ringmaster and accept the quest. Head over to the Blacksteam Shelter and enter the room in the back on 1F.

Talk to all the named characters in here. Head outside and talk to Aya, then return to the concert room and talk to her again. Next, head to the basement of the shelter. You'll find a New World Door!

With Aya as your partner, it won't be too bad. Keep her Salazzle and Naganadel alive, supporting their Heat Waves.

Head up from here. Once Aya presses the switch, you can explore this area a bit. Head straight up and talk to Aya near the Genesects.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/genesect1.png"/>

A pretty huge puzzle room awaits us. From the center of the room, go right (path 1) and use the panel. Go up from here and team up with Arclight for a fight.

A decently tough battle with a lot of Electric types, themed around Shock Drive Genesect. Ground types will generally do well here if you can cover their weaknesses. Tailwind is a good choice to support the already speedy team that Arclight has. Just be prepared for the Genesects - Fire moves are obviously great here. Win to get the *Shock Drive*. 

Return to the center - one of the computer terminals will allow us to insert the Shock Drive, which causes the room to light up. Do so, then head straight left, going down and right to activate a panel (path 2). The path down from here is closed while the power is on.

Return to the center and remove the Shock Drive. Return to the left and go down (path 3), then open a shutter at the bottom.

Return to the center and use the henceforth called Shutter Terminal on the bottom (it says "SHUTTER SYSTEM--MODE A/B"). Going down from the center will require one setting of the Shutter Terminal, while going up, left, or right requires the other setting. With the Shutter Terminal changed and no Drives in the computer, go down, left and up (path 4) to reach another fight.

This one is themed around the Chill Drive - Alolan Ninetales is a familiar lead by now. It helps that all but Aurorus and Porygon-Z are weak to Fire, so exploit this weakness to win. Emerge victorious to get the *Chill Drive*. 

Return to the center. Activate Shutter Terminal (to be able to go up) and insert both the Shock and Chill Drives. Head up and talk to Aya. Follow the path (5) up and to the left and activate the shutter.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/genesect2.png"/>

Return to the center. With both Drives still in the computer, go right to activate another panel (6).

Return to the center again. Remove the Shock Drive, leaving in the Chill Drive, and activate the Shutter Terminal. Go down, left, then all the way up to the top left corner of the room (path 7) for another fight, with Titania as a partner.

The Burn Drive team. Although Titania is weak to Fire on paper, her team is pretty solid for this fight... maybe because her team is so solid in general. Anyways, Water, Rock, and Ground type moves will do great here, or you can double down and run your own Fire types under Sun.

You'll get the *Burn Drive* once you win. Make your way back to the center. Insert the Burn Drive, leaving in the Chill Drive but holding on to the Shock Drive, and activate the Shutter Terminal. Head up to talk to Aya once more then go right and down (path 8) to activate another panel.

Back at the center, leave the Drives as is: Burn and Chill in the computer, Shock in the bag. Make your way right, down, then left to activate another panel (path 9).

Return to the center. Leaving the Drives as is again, activate the Shutter Terminal. Go down, follow the path right and up, and talk to a panel at the end of this path (10). 

Return to the center. Activate the Shutter Terminal and insert the Shock Drive, meaning all three Drives are in the computer. Go right and follow the path (11) to the top right. Talk to the machine here and activate combustion power. This will open up a path above to a tag battle with Hardy.

Finally, the Douse Drive themed team. This one is a bit harder in my opinion than the previous few just because Rain is the best weather condition. There are FOUR Bug/Steel types in this battle, so if you can change the weather to Sun or at least away from Rain, Fire types can be very useful here. Just note that Hardy's Pokemon are generally fast and frail and will die to the Water type moves, so look out for that.

Once you win, you'll get the *Douse Drive*. Head back to the center, then go up from here and talk to Hardy if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy when he's with Aya in the Neo Blacksteam Fabrication (+1 Aya)

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/genesect3.png"/>

Make your way to the center, remove the Chill Drive and Shock Drive, insert the Douse Drive (and leave in the Burn Drive), and use the Shutter Terminal. Go down, right, and all the way up to the top right of the room (path 12) to reach a machine. Activate the steam power system - in a nearby capsule, you'll find:

**ZCell 41: Neo Blacksteam Fabrication**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_41.jpg"/>

Return to the center. Remove the Burn Drive, and put in the Chill Drive. The Shock Drive should remain in your bag, while the Douse Drive should remain in the computer. Go to the bottom right corner of the room (path 13) where there is another machine. Activate the supercooling system here - in the capsule, you'll find:

**ZCell 42: Neo Blacksteam Fabrication**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_42.jpg"/>

Back in the center, add the Shock Drive to the Douse Drive and Chill Drive already in the computer, but hold onto the Burn Drive. Make your way to the bottom left corner (path 14), and activate hydroelectric power. In the capsule:

**ZCell 43: Neo Blacksteam Fabrication**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_43.jpg"/>

Make your way back to the center. Remove the Shock Drive, make sure the Burn, Chill, and Douse Drives are inserted, then make your way around the bottom, up the left side, and to the top of the room (path 15). You'll find a **Genesect** to catch up here!

Make your way back to the center of the room, remove the remaining Drives, then exit at the bottom. Talk to Aya to view a scene, then go to the right. On Lin Route, you'll have an extra straightforward step to do here. Return to the Nightclub!

## Idyll of Pestilence & Panaceance

Accept Zero's quest, then head over to the Peridot Ward. In Seacrest's garden, you'll find a New World Door!

Make your way around the right side of the large hill. You'll see stairs here that let us climb up. Make your way to the top.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree to stop Eve (+1 Lumi)
- Refuse to stop Eve (+1 Eve)

If you choose to stop Eve, you'll have to battle her, else, you'll have to fight Lumi.

Either way, once you win, you'll get your next objective: collecting 5 Shaymin. The first one is right above you - they look like bushes.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/idyll02.png"/>

Make your way up and right. In this area, you can find an *Ultra Ball*. Navigate through the massive hop rock maze at the top, then interact with the orb on the next island. At the bottom of this island is a springy grass - step on it to reach another island with the second Shaymin. Use the springy grass to return to the center.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/idyll03.png"/>

Make your way around the center to the top left. Use the springy grass here to hop between hills - the green arrows in the above image indicate direction. Following the red numbers 1-5 first, our first objective is an orb. Once you reach a choice, use the leftmost one; at the next, use the bottom one.

Our next objective is Shaymin: follow the yellow numbers 6-11. Use the bottom springy grass to return to the hill with three. Again, use the left one, and at the next hill, use the top one by the tree. At the next fork, go up to reach the third Shaymin!

We can actually surf here - climb the waterfall to reach an *EV Booster* and a *Max Revive*. Follow the blue numbers 12-15 to return to the center of the Idyll: starting with the springy grass near Shaymin to reach the center again.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/idyll04.png"/>

Next, go to the bottom right, where the hedge maze is. At the first fork, go left (yellow) to reach an orb. Make your way through the rest of the maze (blue) to get the fourth Shaymin in the bottom right corner, then return to the center.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/idyll05.png"/>

Finally, make your way to the bottom left corner, where the mushrooms are. Walk under the first two mushrooms to clear a path forward. Go to the top left, stand under the mushroom, and grab the nearby *Telluric Seed* (blue path). If you go up from this mushroom, you can reach a springy grass that will take you to:

**ZCell 44: Idyll of Pestilence**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_44.jpg"/>

Return to the mushroom area. Follow the left edge of this area down (yellow path), then go right, using three mushrooms along the way. Talk to the orb at the end here. Use some mushrooms (red path) to reach the bottom right side of the area. Talk to the fifth Shaymin! Return to the top of the hill in the center.

Talk to Eve once, then again for a battle.

Eve will be your ally. The opponents team largely relies on hazard damage, corrosion damage, and switching your Pokemon out with things like Whirlwind and Red Cards. Sticky Hold and Suction Cups can help alleviate these issues, as can Rapid Spin and Defog. Shaymin will also frequently transform the field to Grassy Terrain, so keep that in mind.

Once you win, the Shaymin will purify the area! This area has the same basic layout as the wasteland version, but has new puzzles in each quadrant.

Our first destination is the hedge maze in the bottom right corner. Follow the path up, escape the maze, and go around (the red path). Activate the orb at the end. Make your way back around and go through the now-open hedge path (green). Activate the next orb (yellow path). Follow the final path (pink) to reach the first of four *Gracidea* in the bottom right!

Next, head to the mushroom forest area in the bottom left. Activate the red mushroom. We can't actually progress in this corner yet but we need this mushroom activated to continue elsewhere.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/idyll07.png"/>

Head to the top left corner next, with all the springy grass. You'll see a mushroom near the entrance glowing red. Following the path (yellow numbers 1-10), use the bottom of two grasses at all three of the first forks. At the choice of three grasses, use the one on the left, then the top right in the next choice. Finally, choose the top grass to reach the second *Gracidea*. Climb back up this waterfall to get the *Soul Dew*! Return to the center of the Idyll (using the pink numbers 11-14).

Make your way back to the mushroom area in the bottom left corner. Proceed past the red mushroom, using a springy grass towards the top, till you reach a purple mushroom. Step under it. We can't proceed any further down here, so take the bottom springy grass to escape this quadrant for now.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/idyll08.png"/>

Make your way to the top right corner next. Hop to the left (blue path) to get a *Full Restore*. Hop your way up and left in order to ultimately go down and right (green path) to get:

**ZCell 45: Idyll of Panaceance**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_45.jpg"/>

Hop to the island in the top right corner (pink path). Talk to the orb then use the springy grass to reach the third *Gracidea*.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/idyll09.png"/>

Finally, return to the mushrooms in the bottom left corner. Follow the path through activating the purple mushroom as before, but take the top springy grass this time. Use the blue mushroom, then go down. Activate mushrooms as you go, making sure to go left once you use the red mushroom. Talk to the orb at the end of the path.

Use the blue mushroom down and left from here, then follow the opened path. Use a red mushroom once more, then the blue mushroom in the bottom right corner. Grab the final *Gracidea*!

Return to the center and climb the hill. Craudberry will show up... and we have a bit of an interesting battle-based quest to take care of!

Winning this battle isn't hard. However, the catch here is that we actually need to end the battle with the Flower Garden Field at Stage 5... and Craudberry does everything in her power to ruin this mission.

To succeed, you'll have to keep a few things in mind. First of all: any temporary field changes are bad, since they will reset your Flower Garden to progress. This means that Sun + Rain together is a bad idea thanks to Rainbow Field. Heat Waves on Heatmor, Torkoal, and Crobat will turn the field into Burning Field when it is not raining, and one use of Amoonguss' Grassy Terrain will switch the field as well. Even within the Flower Garden, its Acid Downpour will reset the field to Stage 1, so you'll need to either knock out Amoonguss in one turn or worry about building up the field after the Z-Move is used. Finally, Cut and X-Scissor cut the field down a stage for each use, so you probably want to make sure Victreebel and Qwilfish don't use it much. Using a Nature Power Growth sweeper and/or giving your entire party Synthetic Seeds should then net you the win condition.

Talk to the nearby **Shaymin** once you're done to take it with you! To the right is a *Gracidea* that you can keep. Return to the Nightclub once you're done!

## Anomalies at Subseven Sanctum

Accept Danielle's quest. Make your way to the Subseven Sanctum and enter the room on the left side of the maze. Talk to Luna then enter the door.

Defeat the acolytes. You'll wake up in a cage - you can talk to the Arceus statue to walk through walls for a finite number of tiles. The 'A' key brings you back to the last statue you have used, if you get stuck.

Start by using this statue and going straight up. Talk to the Blue Statue to the left, then return to your cell. Talk to Lukah in his, then go up the stairs yourself.

In this hallway, go up and left to enter the room with the New World Door we were previously in. If you talk to any of the statues on the left side, you can walk through the wall to reach the Red Statue. Return to the previous room.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/subseven_path_1.jpg"/>

This main room is a huge maze. Note that you can get up to two 'extra steps' by talking to the statue from above, in certain situations, so if it seems like it's impossible to reach the next area, try doing that.

The next path you have to take will lead you to the Green Statue. Note that if you mess up and end up in some of the rooms on the left side, you'll have to go back to the beginning and start again.

A lot of Ground weaknesses here, so taking advantage of the fact that your allies won't be hurt by Earthquake on this field might be the key. Note that Magearna gets stronger for every knockout, so targeting it first may be helpful. Trick Room is also great for this one.

Afterwards, you can catch **Palkia**!

With that taken care of, the maze below will now be fixed. Head into the door on the right side and use the Light Shard. Time to battle the time deity next.

Another Holy Field doubles battle. A fast Bug type or two can solve the problem of the leads. The rest of the team is pretty diverse, but taking advantage of the field or getting a sweeper set up should work.

Catch **Dialga** once you win!

Well, the field will instantly change to Grassy Terrain, then likely to Burning Field thanks to Heat Wave and Eruption. Rock, Water, and Ground moves make this simple once you can take out Tapu Bulu.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- If you beat Solaris at Pyrous and are on Reshiram Route, finish the sanctum quest (+2 Luna)

Anyways, return to the Nightclub!

While you're here, if you're on Reshiram Route, Taka will ask you to see his Chatot. We got this back in Victory Road.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Show Taka his Chatot in Reshiram Route (+2 Taka)

## Endgame

This next one has some hard fights, so prep your team accordingly.

Accept the final quest at the Nightclub with Cass. Stock up on healing items and prepare your best team, then fly over to Agate City. Head down to Route 1, climb the rocks to reach Iolia Valley, then climb the waterfall at the top of the area to reach a cave. Use the Purple Crystal to enter a New World Door.

Another fight with PULSE Hypno, this time with the support of a full team on the Chess Board. I recommend Quick Guard for this fight - you'll be able to block First Impression, all of the King Rhyperior's moves, and Sucker Punch. You'll also be at the mercy of Hypno's Dark Void, so Safeguard, Chesto Berries, Sleep Talk, etc. can all be useful in keeping your momentum here. If you don't already have a Z-Move planned out, the Buginium-Z can be crucial to taking out Hypno. Bring your own King for some priority shenanigans if needed.

There's something all of these wild Pokemon have in common... hmm...

Anyways, we'll get our quest above. Collecting three Nanab Berries? Simple!

Start by following the path around to the left, and grab the hidden *Pretty Wing*. Proceed and you'll see... oh god.

Five PULSEs in one battle, on a field that makes this fight very interesting. First out is PULSE Abra, with three special moves that trade massive power for a recharge turn, and Metronome. While the latter isn't really an issue, this field makes it so recharge moves don't waste a turn whenever they secure knockouts, meaning whenever the powerful Abra can one shot you, it doesn't ever recharge. Clawitzer works basically the same as before with Contrary boosts and massive speed, though needs to recharge when using Hydro Cannon. Magnezone has Bolt Strike for damage, Core Enforcer for coverage, and Parabolic Charge and Recover for healing, on top of Levitate, meaning it is hard to take down. PULSE Muk is mostly a special set with Protean Giga Drain and Fire Blast, but can use priority Shadow Sneak as well as Explosion, which is a nuke on this field. Finally there is PULSE Mr. Mime, who has only Psycho Boost. The 1 base SpA and Psycho Boost SpA drops get ignored in favor of Mime's 190 SpD, so it can fire off this move over and over for massive damage. Note that its Wonder Guard ability plus the fact that Fairy moves are turned into Normal on this field means... you can't even damage it with attacking moves!

One thing to try is just changing the field outright - with the Tapus, various weather conditions, pledge moves, etc. Without Glitch Field, most of the PULSE team's strategies will be dampened significantly. If you do play on the field, I recommend some combination of the following: either something fast with a Choice Scarf that can one-shot Abra or a Dark type with a lot of SpD, such as Umbreon. A fast Pokemon with Smack Down plus another with a physical Ground move to take care of Magnezone, or perhaps the Fightinium-Z. Mirror Coat, Gastro Acid, Topsy-Turvy, Haze, etc. are all good moves to counter Clawitzer's strategy if you're having trouble, or you can use the Dragonium-Z to nuke it. A Dark type with Toxic is my recommended strategy to deal with Mime since it can't touch a Dark type, bonus points if you have a set up move to help deal with the rest of the team. Anything with decent SpD can probably handle Muk; bonus points if you can bait it's Explosion with Protect!

Once you win, you'll get the first *Nanab Berry*!

Back in the center, you'll find Anna, who can heal your team. Anyways, proceed to the right side next. Grab the hidden *Health Wing* then go down for another fight.

The PULSE we never actually got to fight is here at last... It has Shedinja's 1 HP gimmick on top of Sturdy, meaning it just shrugs off every attack! On top of its Lum Berry and the rest of the team having Safeguard and Rage Powder, the team makes every attempt to prevent you from simply poisoning it. The New World field prevents weather chip damage as well. With field-boosted Earth Power and always max power Eruption, it hits hard too, so trying to stall out its PP may result in your team dead. The rest of the team is a solid Double's support team.

How DO you beat it, then? Camerupt's ONLY good stat is SpA, so if you get up Light Screen and get out some Pokemon with good SpD, you might be able to just eat its attacks and focus on the rest of the team, all of which aren't really dedicated attackers. Eventually you can use Toxic on it once the support is dead! "Easy mode" is just to send out a Pokemon with Mold Breaker, Gastro Acid, Worry Seed, Skill Swap, etc., which the team has no answers for, since Camerupt can then be literally knocked out with any non-immune attacking move. Then the rest of the fight is fairly simple.

Get the second *Nanab Berry* for winning.

Back in the center, head up. On a small path to the right is a hidden *Swift Wing*. Past ??? is a hidden *Muscle Wing*. Up from here is a hidden *Resist Wing*, and a *Genius Wing* and *Clever Wing* are to the left.

We already fought the "absurdly strong PULSEs who are good on Glitch Field" so now it's time for the "absurdly tanky PULSEs who are good on the Swamp Field". As you can probably tell, these PULSEs are dedicated to bulk, healing, and gradually wearing you down. They also use Trick Room to take advantage of their generally low speed. On top of this, their Poison and Mud-based Water and Ground moves are all powered up here.

As in the other fight, you can use the various generated fields we've collected by now if you want to take some of the wind out of their strategy. You can also stick it out on the Swamp Field if you want. One thing to try would be to set up your own tanks - Steel and Poison types can use the Telluric Seed to great effect here, for example. Sludge Wave and Gunk Shot get a 2.25x boost on this field, so you can try to set up and use that move to overwhelm your opponents - only Swalot resists Poison. Sleep Powder has perfect accuracy on this field - so I recommend using this move liberally to prevent Trick Room, allow your partner to set up, etc. You can also use Toxic on half of the team, or consider something like the Ghost type version of Curse to rapidly drain HP.

Win to nab the third *Nanab Berry*, then return to the ??? guy. Up and to the right, you'll be able to follow a new path. Hug the bottom wall to reach:

**ZCell 46: Endgame**

Oh. Your team is all set to Lv. 1 and you can't use bag items. Oh no.

Unlike Solaris at Pyrous, this battle truly is intended to be lost, and there is no reward other than a few lines of dialogue for winning. There are technically ways to win, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.

Head back up and talk to Shiv again. With all that taken care of, you'll receive Darkrai! Return to the Nightclub.

## Water Treatment Center Anomaly

Talk to Smeargle and accept the quest. Head on down to the Water Treatment Center and make your way to the room in the top right corner, the Onyx Water Grid. Enter the New World Door!

A fight with Umbral Corey! Nothing much to say here, you can beat him.

Head on back to the Nightclub and OH GOD

Ok, so we were actually still dreaming. Head down from here and talk to Luna again. To progress, reverse course and go up instead - you'll see Shiv again and have to fight him!

A pretty annoying team that relies on, well, putting you to sleep constantly. Every single one is weak to Fairy moves, however, so a couple speedy Dazzling Gleam users trivialize this fight.

Once you win, you'll be able to catch **Darkrai**, for real this time. I mean it. Return to the Nightclub!

# Postgame Episode 7: Up, Down, n' All Around

The level cap now sits at Lv. 135.

## Rhodochrine Tree (Part 1)

Accept Nyu's quest in the Nightclub, then fly over to Beryl Ward. Enter Rhodochrine Jungle and make your way to the large tree at the top. Talk to Lumi here and agree to fetch the food from the Spyce. Make your way to Spyce in the North Obsidia Ward, get the 6 *Bubble Teas* from the lady behind the counter, then return to the jungle.

Talk to Lumi outside once more, and you'll see a New World Door has opened. Great. Before we enter it though, head down to the Underroot. You'll find Shelly along with all of the following:

**ZCell 47: The Underroot**

**ZCell 48: The Underroot**

**ZCell 49: The Underroot**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_49.jpg"/>

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_50.jpg"/>

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_51.jpg"/>

**ZCell 52: The Underroot**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_52.jpg"/>

**ZCell 53: The Underroot**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_53.jpg"/>

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_55.jpg"/>

**ZCell 56: The Underroot**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_56.jpg"/>

With those all taken care of, return to the Rhodochrine Tree and enter the New World Door.

The tree is another puzzle! Essentially, the goal will be to 'balance' the Anomalous (light) and Umbral (dark) energy in each room by knocking out Pokemon of each kind.

In the first room, knock out one of the Espeon to proceed.

Essentially, each species has a prime number 'value' among the first 8 primes - adding up the values for Anomalous and Umbral Pokemon in each room yet to be knocked out will tell you the current score - make them equal to continue. Note that you can't simply knock all of the Pokemon out - there must be at least one of each type still around.

In the second room, you'll be told Chingling is 2, Espeon is 3, and Mightyena is 5. By extension from the first floor, you'll be able to conclude Umbreon is 3.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Since Mightyena is the only Umbral Pokemon it must be kept alive: bringing the Anomalous total to 5 requires knocking out one Chingling.
  </div>

</div>

In the third room, the Anomalous total is 7, and the Umbral total is 10. Eve will tell us Togetic is 7 before having to flee, so Noel will join us as we proceed.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    To bring the Umbral total down to 7, knocking out Umbreon is the way. Note that this implies that Mismagius is worth 7.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

In the fourth room, the totals are 12 and 14, respectively.  There are two Mismagius, a Togetic, a Cleffa, and an Espeon in this room.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    The solution: Since we know the values of Togetic and Espeon, we can conclude Cleffa is 2. We know that we will need to knock out at least one Umbral Pokemon but not both... so knocking out one Mismagius leads to an Umbral total of 7. To the Anomalous total down from 12, then, we'll need to knock out Cleffa and Espeon.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The fifth room has totals of 10 and 9, respectively. There are three Umbreon here, as well as one each of Flabebe, Floette, and Florges. We aren't directly given the values of any of these three, however.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Since the three Anomalous Pokemon have prime values, the only way to make 10 from three primes is by adding 2, 3, and 5. The game doesn't really tell you this until after this puzzle, but within evolutionary lines the further along species has the higher values - so Flabebe is 2, Floette is 3, and Florges is 5. With that information, we know we will need to knock out either one or two Umbreons to make an Umbral total of 3 or 6... but the latter cannot be obtained by any sum of 2, 3, and 5. So, knock out two Umbreon, Flabebe, and Florges to reach a balance of 3.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The sixth room has totals of 30 and 26. On the Anomalous side, you'll notice 2 Floette, 1 Florges, 1 Chingling, 2 Espeon, and 1 Granbull. On the Umbral side, you'll notice 2 Zweilous.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Since we have 2 Zweilous and an Umbral total of 26, we can conclude Zweilous is 13. By subtracting one 2, four 3's, and one 5 from 30, we can conclude that Granbull is 11. Since we can't simply remove 4 from the Anomalous side to reach 26, we'll need to knock out one Zweilous, making the target 13. As for the Anomalous side, knocking out Granbull and both Floettes will reach the balance of 13.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The seventh room has 24 and 21. There is 1 Spritzee and 2 Kadabra in here, as well as 1 Houndour, 1 Murkrow, and 1 Zweilous.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    First, we can figure out the values. Note that the Anomalous total is even, and the 2 Kadabra together will always have an even total. This implies Spritzee is even, since it is a prime, Spritzee is 2. We can thus conclude Kadabra is 11. On the other side, Murkrow and Houndour together add up to 8, meaning one of them must be 3 and the other 5. Shelving this for now, we now look at all the possible states of the Anomalous side. Keeping 2/3 alive would result in a total of either 13 or 22, while keeping only 1/3 alive would result in a total of either 2 or 11. None of the Umbral Pokemon are valued 2 or 11, and the Dark total begins at 21, meaning 13 must be the target value - knocking out one Kadabra will get us there on the Anomalous side. Luckily for us, Zweilous is valued 13, so we can knock out Houndour and Murkrow without being sure of their values to finish this room.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The eighth room has 18 and 24. The Anomalous Pokemon are 1 Granbull and 1 Togetic, and the Umbral Pokemon are 1 Houndour, 1 Drifloon, and 1 Mandibuzz.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    First, we will try to figure out what we can learn about the values of the Umbral Pokemon. If Houndour is 3, then Drifloon and Mandibuzz will total 21. Two odd numbers can't sum to an odd number, so one of them must be 2, meaning the other would be 19. If instead Houndour is 5, then Drifloon and Mandibuzz would total 19; by similar logic, would then be 2 and 17. We know that we will need to target either 7 or 11 thanks to the Anomalous side only having 2 Pokemon. So, how can we total 7 or 11 in the first case, where the Umbral values are 2, 3, 19? Well, we can't - one knockout would mean a total 5, 21, or 22. In the second case, however, the Umbral values being 2, 5, 17 would mean we simply have to knock out the 17 - since a solution exists, we can conclude Houndour is 5. We still aren't told whether Drifloon is 2 or 17, but later puzzles reveal that we can assume all evolutionary line members should be assumed to exist, even if they aren't present - meaning we can assume Vullaby exists, so Mandibuzz can't be the lowest prime in 2. So Drifloon is 2 and Mandibuzz is 17, and knocking out Mandibuzz and Granbull is all you need to do.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solution to this floor</a>
</div>

The ninth room has 20 and 31. The Anomalous Pokemon are 1 Clefable and 1 Chimecho, while the Umbral Pokemon are 1 Poochyena, 1 Eevee, 1 Vullaby, 3 Deino, 1 Hydreigon, and 1 Misdreavus. We are also finally actually told that evolutions increase in value.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    This one is thankfully easier than it seems - since we know Zweilous is 13, Hydreigon must thus be 17 or 19. There are 7 non Hydreigon Umbral Pokemon. If Hydreigon is 19, then the remaining value is 12... which is not enough for the remaning 7 that all have a minimum of 2. It IS enough when Hydreigon is 17, however, meaning all of the other Umbral Pokemon are 2. So, that's nice. As for the Anomalous two, we know they total 20, hence must be 7 and 13 or 3 and 17. We can't generate 7 or 13 on the Umbral Side, so Chimecho and Clefable are 3 and 17. Since Cleffa is 2, we can infer the existence of Clefairy who must be at least 3. So Clefable isn't 3 and must thus be 17! Knocking out everything except Hydreigon and Clefable does the trick.

With that, we finally reach the top of the tree!

Go to the left all the way to what appears like a dead end, and you'll be able to get:

**ZCell 57: Rhodochrine Tree**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_57.jpg"/>

You can also surf across the water on the right side of the area to reach:

**ZCell 58: Rhodochrine Tree**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_58.jpg"/>

Talk to Noel once more and you'll be taken to the base of the tree. That's it for this quest right now: we'll finish it up later. Return to the Nightclub!

## Mirage Tower Mirages

Accept the quest from Aster, then fly over to Train Town in the desert. Take the portal to the Mirage Tower.

Talk to Laura in the first room. We'll get a choice on going higher in the tower to find Charlotte and lower to find Saphira - we'll be able to do both, though. I'll start by going up. Follow the path through the Mirage Tower the same way as before. When you reach the room that contained Honedge, enter the New World Door.

In this section, more of the same kind of puzzle we did previously in the tower. Only now you can touch the puzzles on both sides. Here I will say the left puzzle is "P1" and the right puzzle is "P2" for notation.

<div class="spoilerDiv">

The third puzzle has a secret. See if you can figure it out.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    The secret is that you can take pieces out of the inscribed squares... anywhere on the map. Anyways, one possible solution: <br/>
    P2: R2, P1: L2, P2: U2, P1: L2 U2, P2: L2 U R2 U2 L D8 R5 U4 L2 D, P1: D3 R6 L4 D2 L2, P2: D2

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">

Once you finish the puzzle, you can grab:

**ZCell 59: Mirage Tower?**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_59.jpg"/>

You can also get the *Solganium-Z* here. Proceed to the next room.

<div class="spoilerDiv">

Once you succeed, you'll get the *Latiasite* and *Latiosite*! Nice. However, there's still more to do: return to the previous room.

You can walk up past the New World Door, finding another New World Door at the very top. In the next room is an Anomaly!

If the field is broken, you'll go to New World... where all the Magical Seeds and many of your opponents moves will be activated. The team is all Flying or Dragon type, so make sure you can exploit those two weaknesses with some sweepers to win.

Afterwards, you'll be able to catch **Ho-oh**, who is holding a *Sacred Ash*! Accept the fast travel request to the entrance to the Mirage Tower. Next, break all of the mirrors on this floor to open a bath to Mirage Tower B1F.

You'll find a New World Door to the left, so head on in. Talk to Saphira, then head down the ladder. At the end of the path is a mirror. Smashing it will take you to a different dimension of sorts. Push the stone up, then un-smash the mirror - the ladder has moved! Take it to proceed.

In the next area, head down the ladder to get a hidden *Rare Bone*. Head up the ladder, then smash the mirror to enter the crystal dimension. Head through the New World Door at the bottom to get:

**ZCell 60: Mirage Tower?**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_60.jpg"/>

Complete the rest of the room: using what we've just learned will make it straightforward. Push the stone in a clockwise loop around the room to continuously push the ladder.

The next section is generally similar, note that you can access the mirror from upper levels and lower levels. On the left side of the loop, you'll be able to push the stone into a rectangle - if you can get it into the bottom left corner, the ladder will take you onto the rock to the *Lunalium-Z* as well as:

**ZCell 61: Mirage Tower?**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_61.jpg"/>

Make it to the end of the room and exit at the top. You'll talk to Saphira here, and also you'll be able to find:

**ZCell 62: Mirage Tower?**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_62.jpg"/>

Exiting from here does send you back to the beginning, but Saphira has made returning pretty simple as she has gotten rid of the webs. The dead end isn't a real dead end - if you return to the crystal dimension just before the final portal, pushing the stone to the bottom left corner will allow you to access another path across some water. Follow this path to another Anomaly!

Been a while since we've had to fight on this terrain, but you can surely handle it. Be careful of Kommo-o with it's Z-Move and the very bulky Lugia.

Win, and you can catch **Lugia**! Accept the fast travel back up, watch the conversation, then head back to the Nightclub.

## New World Crash (Part 1)

Accept Simon's quest, then fly over to the Beryl Ward. Cross the bridge and enter Citrine Mountain. Make your way to the bottom right corner of the room, then climb up the rocks and surf to the waterfall in the top right corner. Enter the New World Door.

After the conversation in the middle, follow the narrow paths to the corners of the area and talk to the small rocks. Once you've done all four, go to the top of the area for an Anomaly battle!

Nothing too crazy here, I guess. Deoxys Defense is probably the most threatening - if it can set up defenses AND offenses, you're going to have a bad time. Abuse Dark type moves being buffed on this field to one shot it if you need to.

Once you win, you can catch **Deoxys**! 

Head back to the nightclub.

## Cauldron of the Future

Accept Sandy's quest next, then make your way through the desert all the way to Teknite Cave. Make your way to the [Teknite Ridge](#teknite-cave--teknite-ridge) via going left at the fork in the cave. Climb the rocks at the top to reach a New World Door! Enter it.

Pretty sweet - we can catch Celesteela now, as well as Cosmog. Fish in the void lake near Adrienn to get some! Grab two of them (four for the living dex) to also obtain **Cosmoem**, **Solgaleo**, and **Lunala** by evolving at Lv. 43, 53 during the day, and 53 during the night, respectively. You can also get another Type: Null here for living dex purposes if you like.

Follow the path to the left to find:

**ZCell 63: Cauldron of the Future**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_63.jpg"/>

It's also worth noting that the glowing mining rocks here will infinitely replenish if you exit this area and return, so no need to buy Blast Powder or worry about the finite number of rocks in the region.

Talk to Adrienn - there are no mandatory battles in this section. A refreshing break!

Once you're done here, return to the Nightclub.

## Umbral Battles in Aegir Cave (Part 1)

Accept your gang leader's quest next. Return to the desert and make your way to the [Sugiline Cave](#sugiline-cave). Make your way to the back via the Garchomp Statue maze. Enter the New World Door just to the right of the top of the room!

The fight will go instantly to Grassy Terrain for a little while. As long as you have a few Specially Defensive and fast Pokemon, letting Celesteela hang around while you attack the other, faster Pokemon on the field can be a good idea. Changing the field to Corrosive Field can be useful for gaining momentum.

Another pretty tough one. Diamond Storm and Power Gem both turn the field to the Crystal Cavern Field, so watch out for that. A couple Steel leads might be ideal to start here - speed and/or Bullet Punch can help them OHKO Diancie. The rest of the team is generally weak to some combination of Ground and Fighting type moves barring Marshadow - who has priority, a Z-Move, and Spectral Thief to ruin your set ups. Take advantage of Regigigas being a sort of underwhelming support set to take out the threats if you need to.

Once you win against both Umbral opponents, talk to Florinia.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Florinia you understand your next objective (+1 Florinia)

Florinia will tell us that we need to catch Rayquaza in order to fix the issues here. We will do so, but later on. That's it for this quest for now, so make your way back to the Nightclub.

## New World Helix

Finally, accept Smeargle's quest. Head over to Apophyll Cave and make your way to 2F. Enter the New World Door!

Depending on your route, you'll see Taka or Zero above, who will join you for this quest.

Switching between us and them with the "A" key, you'll need to progress with each character to get the other to proceed. To succeed:

- As the Ex-Meteor (XM), activate the orb by going down.
- As the main character (MC), head up and activate a crystal by going clockwise.
- XM: Go up as far as you can and talk to Abomasnow and use Snow Warning.
- MC: Continue along the path, past the snowdrift.
- XM: Go all the way down counter-clockwise, until you reach the orb you can't do anything with.
- MC: Talk to Altaria and use Cloud Nine.
- XM: Activate the orb.
- MC: Cross the ice to the right and activate the orb. Cross back left, talk to Abomasnow on the ice, then go back down and right. Use the crystal.
- XM: Go all the way back up and follow the path clockwise. Use the crystal.
- MC: Climb down the icy stairs. Talk to Altaria, then talk to the orb. Go down into the ice puzzle here and talk to Abomasnow.
- XM: Go down from here. Activate the crystal, then go down past the snowdrift.
- MC: Starting underneath Abomasnow, using the patch in the ice to the left, head down. Stand near the frozen orb.
- XM: Talk to Altaria.
- MC: Use the orb.
- XM: Go to the left. Activate the crystal.
- MC: Head back up to the ice maze and talk to Abomasnow. Head back down.
- XM: Go up and left, and climb down the snowdrift.
- MC: Talk to Altaria.
- XM: Use the orb, activate the crystal beyond, then use the second orb beyond. Head back to the ice puzzle and talk to Abomasnow.
- MC: Go left/clockwise and head up the snow drift, talk to Altaria, and follow the path to activate another orb.
- XM: Talk to Abomasnow, then follow the path right/clockwise to the next frozen orb.
- MC: Backtrack to the nearest Altaria and talk to it.
- XM: Use the orb, then talk to Abomasnow.
- MC: Follow the path all the way to the nine gemstones.
- XM: Make your way to the nine gemstones.

You'll need to transform the gemstones near MC black, and the ones near XM white. Each gemstone also changes the ones immediately around it. It shouldn't be too hard with some trial and error. Head up from here and go through the door.

You'll have a partner here: if we're with Zero:

This first fight can be fairly tough - this field pushes the Icy Field to its limit. With Aurora Veil, your opponents will likely be able to stick around while they build up speed from priority attacks. Mega Kangaskhan can use Fake Out and Power Up Punch to reach +2 in Atk and Spe, so be wary when it comes out. Generally, the team is weak to Rock, Ground, and Ice moves, so try to use those if you can.

Although you do get healed, you'll be thrust into a second Double battle. While it's hard to rely on your ally acting in your favor, Taka does sometimes use Tailwind, which can help out. All but Magearna and Mew are weak to either Rock or Fairy moves, so Rock Slide and especially field-boosted Dazzling Gleam may be very helpful here.

Once you win, three doors will open. Inside each, you can catch **Reshiram**, **Zekrom**, and **Kyurem**! Once you catch the third, prepare your team before you head back out.

Nothing too crazy for this point in the game, but still a formidable challenge. Boosted Dark and Fairy moves will make it easier.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Umbral Ace while Taka is partnered with you, Reshiram Route only (+1 Ace)

Accept the fast travel request once you're done!

In the Nightclub, you can show Ace the Fennekin (or Braixen, Delphox) that we obtained back in the Water Treatment Center, if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Show Ace the WTC Fennekin (+1 Ace)

Talking to them again, you can get a *Red Card*.

## New World Crash (Part 2)

Oh yeah, surprise level cap increase to Lv. 140. Talk to Zero to get the next quest. We need to return to the New World Crash via the door in Citrine Mountain, so make your way back there.

Talk to the woman in front of the meteor for a fight.

Nothing too crazy, but you will notice that we really are in the endgame now as we're up against 3 Ubers casually sprinkled into this team.

Once you win, we'll get our next destination: the Byxbysion Wasteland.

## Distorted Space

Fly over to Byxbysion and make your way into the tunnels. In the room with the branches, enter the second entrance when you're ready.

This is pretty brutal for a singles fight. For one, the team is entirely resistant to basically any way that you would want to try to use the field for your own gain due to Steel and Poison typings. With the field preventing hazard set up and an extremely strong Mega Lucario Bullet Punch to prevent any clever Trick Room sweeping, many of the usually good strategies are busted here. Earth Power, Drill Run, and High Horsepower are all Ground type options that aren't weakened by this field if you want to try them.

Once you win, enter the New World Door to reach Distorted Space.

Defeat the Malamar here. Afterwards, talking to any Malamar will switch which sections of path are walkable and which are not. A path through, with color changes indicating use of Malamar, is as follows:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/distorted_space_1.jpg"/>

The second room introduces a new wrinkle - the space bending statues we used in the Dialga/Palkia quest are back, and used in conjunction with the Malamar. Before continuing, talk to the first accessible Malamar, then walk back through the portal to the previous room. Use the statue to go left to grab the *Marshadium-Z*! Anyways, the path through the second room is as follows:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/distorted_space_2.jpg"/>

Note that once you reach the gold stars the second time, you'll need to talk to Malamar while you still have your walk-through-walls ability from the upper statue, then head right back up to these two statues to continue.

In the next room, we first will need to interact with the two orbs towards the bottom of the map. Once you do, you'll use statues and Malamar to return to the entrance to this room, ready to go again.

To reach the left orb, follow this path:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/distorted_space_3.jpg"/>

To reach the right orb, follow this path, noting that at the Blue Star, you'll need to talk to Malamar then press 'A' to return to the previous statue:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/distorted_space_4.jpg"/>

With that taken care of, use the only available statue to reach the center of the middle section above. Grab the *Lustrous Orb*, *Adamant Orb*, as well as:

**ZCell 64: Distorted Space**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_64.jpg"/>

This final puzzle in here is a bit more complicated. If you're on Anna Route, this puzzle will basically be solved for you automatically, so I'll show the full solution for Lin Route here. First, use the statue to reach Malamar, then make your way back to the center. We can solve this puzzle entirely without having to use Malamar again after this (to be sure you're on the right one, make sure the left Giratina statue is activated).

Anyways, at any instant you have three actions that you can take - press the left column, press the right column, and press the center. There are five colors in play: White (W), Light Gray (L), Gray (G), Dark Gray (D), and Black (B). When you press the left column, the five tiles in the column will shift cyclically. To reach the left column, you'll need to use the statue to walk through walls. The right column works similarly, though you won't have to do any phasing.

Talking to the center is a bit more complex: when you talk to the center, it will pull the top block from each of the columns and combine them to make a composite color. W + G = L, for example, and W + B = G. In cases where there is an odd number of 'gaps', it will favor the extreme, so W + L = W, and W + D = L. It will also shift the current five blocks in the center downward, and split the bottom-most block into two components, which will go to the bottom of the left and right columns respectively. To win, you'll need to fill the center column with, bottom to top, B, D, G, L, W blocks.

Figuring out what is going on might be harder than doing the puzzle itself, which you can kinda brute force. Honestly, I recommend spending a minute or two just randomly pressing the center and each column until you have a big mess of different colors all over the puzzle. Then, use the two columns to pull blocks that will generate B into the top - either B + B or B + D will work. Next, pull in blocks that will generate D, then G, L, and finally W. If at any point you are unable to create the desired block, simply continuously press the center 9 times and mess with the columns some more until you're able to. Head through the door when you're ready!

We actually only have to fight the following battle on Lin Route, as on Anna Route Taka will take care of it:

Inverse Field! Probably weren't expecting this, were you? Might as well go all in on the 'new' type matchups for this one - Fighting is a great choice for Lugia and Yveltal, and Psychic can take the Ice types and Yveltal as well. Fake out and/or hazards are good choices for the Sashes. Using Psych Up or Haze may be useful for the enemy Magical Seeds, or you can just abuse your own.

Catch **Giratina** next.

If you're on Anna Route, you'll need to reset the game a few times through some deceptive "Bad End" screens to proceed. Anyways, return to the Nightclub to really begin wrapping up the postgame!

# Postgame Episode 8: A Canvas of Cyclical Conflict

Word. Level cap up to Lv. 145.

## Citae Prisma

Accept Randall's quest, then fly over to Beryl. Enter Beryl Cave and make your way through until you reach the New World Door. Head on in.

Talk to Serra above. There are some encounters here in the water - notably, one of the strongest Ultra Beasts.

Head up and talk to Luna and Elias. Talking to them will make the room dark or light, respectively. Study the puzzle in the light, then turn it dark to complete it.

Essentially, we will want to make a beam in the center of the room hit one of the four crystals in the corners. Our first goal will be hitting the Blue Crystal. Start by moving the mirror up to hit it:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citae_prisma_1.jpg"/>

Use the crystal, cross the bridge above, and talk to the orb.

You'll notice that there are now two mirrors. Move them in the light, switch it in the dark, then move them again in the darkness. You'll see outlines of the mirrors left over, and using the activated Purple Crystal will move all mirrors from their current locations to their previous locations. Keep this in mind as we solve the future puzzles.

Our next goal will be hitting Green, but to do so, we need to make use of the Purple Crystal. Position the crystals in the light, then move them like so:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citae_prisma_2.jpg"/>

This should light up the purple crystal - don't activate it yet though. Using the Purple Crystal will reset the mirrors to the positions of their shadows from the light, but requires timing: you'll want to move one mirror into place such that a well timed Purple Crystal activation will allow the light to reach Green. The image below shows the direction the light will travel - you must time your use of the Purple Crystal while the light is in the red zone in order to succeed. I recommend turning off speed up for these puzzles.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citae_prisma_3.jpg"/>

Activate the Green Crystal, then smash the debris on the puzzle board. Our next mission will be to activate the Blue and Green crystals at the same time - note that using the prism in the center will reset all crystals but Purple. We now have a beam that goes left out of the prism, so that's useful. First, you'll need to place the mirrors in the light, then move them into place in the dark. First, you'll need to charge Purple like before, so set it up like this:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citae_prisma_4.jpg"/>

Activate Purple. Next, move the mirror into place and solve like before, using Purple while BOTH lights are in their respective 'red zone':

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citae_prisma_5.jpg"/>

Activate both Blue and Green, then follow the path to the right to reach another orb. Also, just across the ice bridge, attempt to walk into the bottom right corner to find:

**ZCell 65: Citae Prisma**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_65.jpg"/>

Our next mission will be to activate Green, Red, and Blue all at the same time. Set up the mirrors in the light, activate Purple as usual, then set up the mirrors to complete the puzzle, which thankfully isn't too different from the previous. Set them up and solve:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citae_prisma_6.jpg"/>

IMPORTANT: Before activating the crystals, move the leftmost mirror down one tile, as otherwise it will get stuck on top of a rock after activating the Red Crystal. Once you do this, activate all three crystals, then make your way to the left to reach another orb. You can also now go up from the puzzle to get:

**ZCell 66: Citae Prisma**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_66.jpg"/>

Talk to Serra in the puzzle, and you'll notice that the final mirror we get is broken. Use the light at the middle, and it will actually go through Serra towards the direction she's facing, so she's essentially a rotatable mirror. We can't teleport her anywhere using the Purple Crystal, though. Our final goal is to have all four crystals activated at once. Again, we can activate Purple beforehand, but we need to set it up so that once we use the prism in the middle, all four beams of light eventually find a respective crystal.

First, set up all the crystals and Serra into their final positions, then turn it light, and dark again.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citae_prisma_7.jpg"/>

Using the prism will activate Purple, so do that next. From here, move the crystals into their next positions. The timing is really tight on this one, so save/reset if needed. Use the Purple Crystal as soon as the light passes both of the circled mirrors.

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/citae_prisma_8.jpg"/>

You'll get confirmation from Serra once you're successful. Activate Blue again to cross the ice bridge and enter the door above. Time for an Anomaly battle once you're ready.

All six members of the confusing Solgaleo, Lunala, and Necrozma fusion bunch are here for a fight, including Ultra Necrozma in all its 754 BST glory. Not to mention some field boosts and seeds to make them even stronger! However, all six of them share the Psychic type, so sweeping with Ghost/Dark moves is the way to go.

Once you win, you can catch **Necrozma**! Exit back to the Nightclub once you're done.

Another tough double battle with a lot of hard hitting Pokemon. I recommend Light Screen and Trick Room - combined, your Pokemon will get slower with every use of Icy Wind, allowing them to hit first. You can switch the field to Mountain if you'd like.

Once you win, Rayquaza will run off... and roam the Reborn region! It functions pretty similarly to the main series roamers - when you switch areas, Rayquaza probably will, too. And, just like the main series games, simply using your Reborn Ball on it is the easiest thing to do. I generally run around Reborn City and check the map until Rayquaza happens to be in the same ward as you, then use Repels to weed out everything else except Rayquaza, who is at Lv. 145.

Anyways, succeed and catch **Rayquaza**, then return to the Nightclub.

## Umbral Battles in Aegir Cave (Part 2)

Now that we have Rayquaza, we can go help out the OTS squad over in the Aegir Cave. Make your way there. Add Rayquaza to your party, then talk to Florinia. She'll then let you access the PC one more time before the gauntlet of sheer pain that follows.

This battle isn't that crazy - you'll notice that most of their Pokemon have moves that indiscriminately damage all Pokemon, including their allies. Bulky Pokemon, Wide Guard, etc. will help here. You'll also notice that if Kyogre and Groudon come in at the same time, the field will change to the Rainbow Field. Rock Slide gets power on the Cave Field and extra flinch chance on the Rainbow Field, so I recommend using it for this fight.

If you're on Lin Route, you get fully healed here... otherwise on Anna Route ONLY the non-fainted Pokemon get healed. Yikes!

The second battle of this gauntlet is determined by:

- Anna Route, Titania RP >= Amaria RP: Fight Amaria
- Anna Route, Titania RP < Amaria RP: Fight Titania
- Lin Route, Titania RP > Amaria RP: Fight Titania
- Lin Route, Titania RP <= Amaria RP: Fight Amaria

Battle whichever gym leader plus anomaly:

This fight is absolute suffering. Even if you get your team fully healed... it's still a 12v6 against a Water Surface team. Your fast grounded Pokemon will get easily outsped, Surf will roll you over, your weather will be overwritten with Heavy Rain... etc. Even if you use Trick Room, there are a few slower opponents poised to take advantage of it like Toxapex. There are a few things we can try to take advantage of: Murkwater Field, Underwater, and Icy Field can all be potentially better to fight on than Water Surface, so changing the field is often smart. One other important thing to note is that Mega Swampert and Black Kyurem are the *only* Pokemon with physical attacking moves, meaning a Special Defense tank or two is going to be particularly well suited to this fight, especially with a Water resistance.

Thankfully I generally think this fight is much nicer than the Amaria fight, but it is still a very tough 12v6. There are a lot of Fire types here, so a sweeper with Ground and Rock moves might be good here. You can transform the Grassy Terrain into Corrosive Field potentially if that will help you. Burning Field activates Elemental Seeds and boosts their many Fire type moves, so it might not be the best choice. I will shoutout Mega Tyranitar for this fight, who basically turns off the strategy of the lead Ninetales and Venusaur, allowing a Dragon Dance sweep.

Once you win, you can catch **Kyogre**/**Groudon**, who holds the *Blue Orb*/*Red Orb*!

Head into the New World via surfing up the waterfalls, where you'll be able to find and catch **Groudon**/**Kyogre**, who holds the *Red Orb*/*Blue Orb*!

Head back down into Aegir Cave to talk to the group, then return to the Nightclub!

## The Mysterious Battle Pavilion Challenger

Accept the Ringmaster's quest next. We'll actually need to win a few Battle Tower-style battles in the Battle Pavilion on the left side of the Nightclub to proceed, so prepare your best team of 3. You can't use Megas or Z-Moves, nor the strong legendaries... so keep that in mind.

Once you beat 4 trainers, you'll face off against this one:

You do have to fight one of the strongest Mega Evolutions without being able to use the same feature, but I think you can find a team that will be able to manage. 4 randomized fights beforehand shouldn't be too terrible, I hope.

Well, our challenger flies away after we win.

## Neoteric Isle

Head over to talk to the Ringmaster once more. Head over to Tanzan Mountain, make your way all the way down to the New World Door beneath the Steelix tunnel room, then head in.

Our final Ultra Beast is located here! Anyways, at the first fork, head down and surf to reach the *N-Lunarizer* as well as:

**ZCell 67: Neoteric Isle**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_67.jpg"/>

Continuing on the path, you'll see another:

**ZCell 68: Neoteric Isle**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_68.jpg"/>

There is one more outside - follow the path to the left of the first tall tower to reach:

**ZCell 69: Neoteric Isle**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_69.jpg"/>

Head back to the first tall tower and enter. Prepare yourself however you can and attempt to enter the door at the top: you'll have to fight **Alter Clone**, a trainer that copies your team and makes them PULSE 2!

An interesting gimmick fight - you have to fight your team, but with PULSE 2. So, your sweepers will be bulkier than usual and your tanks will have more offensive power. One obvious answer to this fight is Trick Room - all of your alter will have 252 in Speed, but you don't have to. Then you can try to get a set up sweep going. There are also ways to cheese this fight with one Pokemon if you're really stuck.

Enter this room. On the left wall you'll see one tile that doesn't look right - walk into it to reach another door. Inside, you can get:

**ZCell 70: Neoteric Isle**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_70.jpg"/>

Head up and talk to Fern, then enter the door to the right. You'll find the *N-Solarizer* as well as:

**ZCell 71: Neoteric Isle**

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zcell_71.jpg"/>

Back at the fork, go up for one heck of a battle.

This fight is rough: it's a 12v6 on the Holy Field, with the potential for Mew's Z-move transforming the field into Psychic Terrain. They have a good mix of super powerful single target moves and field-supported spread moves that make it hard to capitalize too much with standard doubles strategies. Terrakion is a bit weird in that it doesn't have many Attack EV's, so you may be able to one shot Tyranitar with a Fighting move and set up with your other Pokemon on Turn 1. The leads are weak to Ground too, so you can take advantage of the field protecting your teammates and use Earthquake. Field boosted Dazzling Gleam is particularly potent here - only Groudon and Magearna resist it. The team is also quite weak to Psychic moves overall, so you may be able to use Psychic Terrain and/or run with Mew's Z-move to try to sweep on that field. In general, Extremespeed is also extremely potent here and will hit Lunala and Necrozma super-effectively, though hazards are recommended to circumvent Shadow Shield.

Once you regain control, talk to **Mew** and **Mewtwo** for a chance to catch each. Nothing we can do to help out our friend here for now, so return to the Nightclub.

## Twilight Desert (Part 2)

With all 71 Zygarde Cells collected, it's a great time to head on back to the Twilight Desert! Talk to Marcello in the Nightclub and then enter the New World Door in the Tourmaline Desert to the right of the train platform.

First, if you'd like to, talk to the machine in one of the side rooms to exchange your Zygarde Cells for more Cell Imprints, and exchange some for Negative Imprints if you'd like.

Head into the main building and talk to Terra here. If you have collected least 50 cells, the path will be opened here, Terra will give you two *Beast Balls*, and a decent reward will be available later. If not, Terra will ask you if you want to go collect the rest. If not, you'll instead have to fight some battles:

If you have fewer than 10 Cells, you'll fight:

Either by fighting or by simply walking, proceed up from here. If you had at least 50 cells before, you'll need to enhance your Zygarde at this machine, to create **Zygarde 50%**. Otherwise, you'll simply need to create a Zygarde 10% via the other machine, so you'll still need a minimum of 10 cells. Once you have the desired Zygarde Form, show it to Terra.

Hilariously, on Lin Route, you can just... opt out of fighting Anomaly Zygarde here. If you are on Anna Route or opt in:

Glitch Field team that maximizes the shenanigans of the field. Set up a physical sweeper on Toxapex or something to win this one.

Once you win, or if you skipped the fight, you'll get **Zygarde 100%**. Neat.

Before we leave, Walk to the right onto the green tile, then go left down the path. Solve the puzzle at this monitor. When finished, it will look like:

<img class="tabImage" src="/assets/images/reborn/zygarde.jpg"/>

As for actually solving it, you'll notice that you are essentially dragging rows and columns. This is actually very similar to solving the magic square puzzle once you know where everything goes - if we're solving top to bottom, left to right, simply drag the column down so that the target space is in line with the target piece, move the row containing it over so it fits, then move the column back into place. If you could figure out that other puzzle, this one won't be too bad.

Head back to the right to pick up the *DNA Splicers*. Anyways, return to Reborn City.

## Rhodochrine Tree (Part 2)

With 100% Zygarde in your party, talk to Shelly in the Underroot. If you had gotten at least 50 Cells in the previous quest, you'll now get Elias' 6IV Ditto. Helpful for some late game breeding.

Talk to Heather at the base of the tree and accept her offer for a lift to the top. The barriers will be gone now, so we can explore the top. Going up and left, then crossing under a waterfall, you can find the *Diancite*.

Continuing along this path, you'll see Anomaly Xerneas. Talk to it when you're ready.

This fight is wild... not the least because they decided to make the literally useless Cosmoem into an actually contributing Pokemon! The team essentially works via the Psych Up boost for Psychic Terrain - if Cosmoem is allowed to live, Noel will copy the defenses, double his Pokemon's SpA, and go H.A.M. If you want to avoid this, taking out or using Taunt on Cosmoem is a good idea. Your own Pokemon (potentially, with Psych Up) can then do a counter-sweep by cleaning up the right side first!

Once you win, Noel will give you **Xerneas**!

Make your way to the bottom right corner of the area for another fight.

Boosted Dark moves are pretty incredible here - pair a sweeper with something to deal with Xerneas and Yveltal, and you should be ok. Yveltal in particular is annoying thanks to its Dark Aura field boosted Sucker Punches, so keep that in mind.

Once you win, you can catch **Yveltal**.

Talk to Noel towards the top, then attempt to exit once you're ready for one more fight.

The Magical Seeds grant a wish as well as a defense boost to the holder, so a lot of these Pokemon will be a pain to take out... unless you can knock them all out in one shot. A special sweeper, especially with Rainbow Field boosted moves, will be likely to succeed if you can set them up right.

Once you win, accept the fast travel request to return to the Nightclub. Now that we have rescued Eclipse, fly over to Calcenon City and enter her father's house. After a scene inside, Eclipse will give you the *Mewtwonite X* and the *Mewtwonite Y*! You can also talk to the father to get the password: *shinycharm*. Nice.

## Bee's Pokedex Completion Quest (Part 3)

Oh, and there's one more thing we can do. Head over to talk to Bee in Agate City.

We'll learn that she wants to see all of the Ultra Beasts. If you've gotten Nihilego, Buzzwole, Pheromosa, Xurkitree, Celesteela, Kartana, Guzzlord, Poipole, Naganadel, Stakataka, and Blacephalon, talk to her to get the *Ultranecrozium-Z*!

She'll tell us what she wants to see next - full Pokedex completion. If you've been keeping up with the guide so far, we'll already be 806/807 of the way there... so we'll return soon, don't worry.

# Postgame Episode 9: Pokemon Reborn, Reborn!

Boom. Level cap has reached its peak at Lv. 150.

## Preparing for the Final Battle

Head into the Nightclub and talk to Aster. All the anomalies have been taken care of! Yay! Head out of the Nightclub, and Heather will tell you to go to the top of the treehouse.

Make your way there, and talk to Noel. We'll need to bring Giratina to the meteor, and Fern to the tree. First, add Giratina to your party, then make your way via Beryl Cave to Citae Prisma. Talk to the meteor to steal it.

Next, slog through Tanzan Mountain to reach the Neoteric Isle once more. Talk to Florinia and Fern in the back room when you're ready.

One more bout with our friend, Fern. No Mega Scizor this time - it's Mega Mawile, instead. Entei's Extremespeed and Mawile's Sucker Punch are potent anti-sweep options, while his Serperior and Kartana both attempt to sweep themselves. Everything here is weak to Fire, Ground, or both, so if you're stuck, orienting your team around moves of those types might be key.

Accept the fast travel back to the Nightclub. Make your way up to the top of the Rhodochrine Tree and talk to Noel. Once the door opens, talk to Fern for a heal and 100 *Exp. Candy XL*. Head on in when you're ready.

## New World Asylum

This area will be different, depending if you're on Lin or Anna Route. Using your hopping and exploring skills, enter the jail cells with gold chains on the outsides and talk to the inhabitants inside. Climb the chains to reach the sides. Collect six total keys - each key will open one of the locks at the bottom.

On Lin Route, buy some *Lemonade* or get some free *Honey* if you want.

Anyways, once you've explored the area, prepare for what's to come at the top...

A THREE. FIGHT. GAUNTLET. AGAINST ALL PULSE2. WITH NO HEALING. Did you expect anything less from Reborn's grand finale?

The gauntlet's structure being as it is basically means one thing - you HAVE TO SET UP SWEEP. There really isn't another option. Thankfully, in this first fight, only Lycanroc has priority, so Evoboost, Shell Smash, etc. are valid options that should be able to carry you through this one.

This second fight is in doubles, and the whole team is slow. Necrozma and Lunala each have Trick Room and will try to set it up - so making sure you have Taunt is pretty essential for this one. Everything is weak to Ground or Dark, so with field boosted Earth Power, Dark type moves, and maybe a Z-move in a pinch, you should then be able to find a combination of sweepers that is able to take this team out.

Finally, the big one. Tornadus has a nasty habit of U-Turning into Rayquaza, who will instantly get the seed effect and Mega Evolve. We don't want that, so either anticipate the U-Turn with your lead and use an Ice or Fairy type move to oneshot Rayquaza, or do something to prevent Tornadus from living long enough to U-Turn. Yveltal has a Z-move and Sucker Punch, both of which get massive boosts in power, so you'll need to make sure you have a Pokemon that can outplay it here. Ho-oh is pretty chill comparably, though its Sacred Fire is boosted too.

Tornadus and Cresselia both have Sashes - the latter will always use Lunar Dance to give Arceus an extra omniboost on top of the seed it already has. Again, a twice omniboosted Arceus is absolutely brutal to take out - so I recommend hazards like Stealth Rocks to break Cresselia's sash and hopefully one shot it. Pretty much no matter what, you'll need a massively boosted sweeper in order to win this one, so take advantage of the fact Arceus has to recharge for a turn to hit it with two well chosen +6 Field boosted moves if you can, and hopefully that will be enough. Good luck!

Once you finally make it through all that, you'll be able to talk to Lin, hanging on the edge, or Arceus.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Arceus before Lin (-3 Terra)

In either case, you can now catch **Arceus**, finally.

Talk to Lin, either letting her come with you, or not. Exit the area!

Arguably harder than the Lin Gauntlet, Anna's gauntlet is three fights that all take place on the Glitch Field, with a cool new background! The first fight is hard in part thanks to the lead being Lugia, who is able to nuke almost everything with Psyshock, heal with Giga Drain, and use other coverage moves. Mimikyu's Disguise and Shadow Sneak make it hard to set up a fast frail sweeper. With Four Assault Vests, you're going to have a hard time breaking them Specially without a lot of set up. Then there are four other Pokemon pretty much optimized for Glitch Field. In this fight, and frankly the rest of them, I recommend abusing the Synthetic Seed yourself, and going all out with a move like Stockpile or Cosmic Power.

Advice from the last fight generally holds here, but you'll need to be extra careful of Xurkitree, who can counter your set up with it's own, as well as paralyze you. Thankfully, you'll probably have a bit more success on this one with a Special sweeper. Watch out for the hazards and status conditions of this team, and make sure Jirachi doesn't snowball too much.

One more fight, and as you can tell, this one isn't easy, either. Again you'll need some way to use only 1 or 2 of your Pokemon to snowball into a sweep. The big problem here is that PULSE Arceus can heal itself as well as ignore the downsides of Roar of Time and Overheat, and becomes ??? type to negate its weaknesses. You can't easily muscle your way around it, and even a +6 boosted Pokemon might not be able to take it out in one hit. At least you can look at this fight and the previous two for team member inspirations... I guess. Good luck!

Once you're done, you'll be immediately thrust into battle with **Arceus**, who you can finally catch.

## Epilogue

Reborn's credits will then play! Lin or Anna will interject with some comments as the credits roll. Interrupting the credits are character endings, corresponding to the characters for which you have an adequate amount of relationship points!

See if you can spot me in the credits.

With that taken care of, you'll get to play out the section in "Another Time" - Agate City of the future. Feel free to talk to the people here to learn how they grew over the years, then talk to Shelly to return to the present.

Congratulations!

## Bee's Pokedex Completion Quest (Part 4)

With Arceus bagged, we have all 807 Pokemon. Fly over to Agate City and talk to Bee if you've caught 'em all. You'll get the *Game Certificate*, as well as the *Ebony Stonepiece*.

Remember the Arc underneath the Grand Stairway? Make your way there via the room where we met Solaris so long ago. Make your way through the arc as we did after beating the Elite Four. Use the stonepiece on the door and head in to watch a scene. Nice!

One final note: now that we've fully beaten the game, we can return to the Developer Room in the Grand Hall to learn even more about the game's full development process!
