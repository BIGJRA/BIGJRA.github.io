# Episode 19: Pokemon Reborn

Ok, there is no official episode title for the final chapter of the main game, so I defer to the classic: simply giving it the name of the game.

Anyways, exit Hardy's gym.

First, a new default mart inventory update:

!shop("Default Mart (17 Badges)", ["Pok√© Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Escape Rope", "Full Heal", "Ultra Potion", "Max Potion"])

Now that we've defeated Hardy, there is one final move tutor in Peridot Ward's Mosswater Market:

!tutor("Mosswater Market Move Tutor: Elder", [["Hydro Cannon", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Frenzy Plant", "3 Green Shards"], ["Blast Burn", "3 Red Shards"], ["Draco Meteor", "9 Red Shards"]])

## Labradorra City

Fly over to Calcenon City. Talk to Hardy on the west side of the city.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Hardy that you'll trust Bennett (+2 Bennett, +2 Laura, +1 Eve, -2 Saphira)
- Tell Hardy that you won't trust Bennett (+2 Saphira, -2 Bennett, -1 Laura)

After the conversation concludes, you'll regain control. There are more optional conversations we can have for points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Charlotte in the story apartment, answering "Yes" (+1 Saphira, -1 Laura)
- Talk to Charlotte in the story apartment, answering "No" (+1 Laura, -1 Saphira)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to *Cal* in *Cal*cenon City (+1 Cal)

**Relationship Point Choices:**

- Talk to Noel in Calcenon, answering "feel" (-1 Noel)

Anyways, once you're ready, talk to Bennett on the west side of the city to finally begin our infiltration into Labradorra City.

Grab the hidden *Health Wing*, *Potion*, and *Nugget* here. Prepare yourself for the first battle of this chapter... I wiped here on my first time! So did apparently many of the other beta testers, so don't feel too bad.

!battle(["Kenan", :MeteorAceM, 1])

This battle hopefully makes it apparent how threatening the endgame full of PULSE2 will be. Even though Kenan is just a generic Meteor Ace, expect to see fights like this going forward.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* and continue.

!battle(["Diana", :MeteorAceF, 1])

Defeat the next Meteor Ace and head up to watch the scene. Before we continue, head back up to the Pokemon Center. Up and to the right is a path to a hidden *Max Repel* and a now-opened building. Talking to Noel inside will get you the *PULSE Readout 10*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Get the PULSE 10 Notes before defeating this PULSE (+1 Eve)

In the bottom left side of the city, a newly-opened path will lead to a building. Inside is a double battle with Victoria as a partner.

!partner(["Victoria", :Victoria2, 2])

!dbattle(["Steven", :MeteorAceM, 0], ["Avril", :MeteorAceF, 0])

Head up and see who's in the back of this building.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reshiram Route Only: Tell Solaris you wish him dead (+1 Victoria, -1 Cal)
- Reshiram Route Only: Tell Solaris you don't wish him dead (+1 Cal, -1 Victoria)

Head outside and go left. Grab the hidden *Full Heal*, and *Max Potion*. Fight the next Meteor.

!battle(["Audrey", :MeteorAceF, 1])

Grab the hidden *Blue Shard* and *Burn Heal* then go up. Enter the nearby open building, and Sigmund will run off. Open the green case in the back to get a *PP Up*. Back outside, go up.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- On Reshiram Route only, tell Amaria you still trust her (+1 Amaria)
- On Reshiram Route only, tell Amaria you don't trust her (-1 Amaria)

On Reshiram Route Amaria will also join us as a partner for this fight. 

!partner(["Amaria", :AMARIA2, 2])

!dbattle(["Arcturus", :NWCultist, 2], ["Angela", :NWCultistF, 1])

On Zekrom Route, you will get this (slightly different) doubles fight instead:

!dbattle(["Arcturus", :NWCultist, 3], ["Angela", :NWCultistF, 2])


After you defeat them, grab the hidden *Revive* and *Ice Heal*. Enter the nearby building. Follow the path inside.

!dbattle(["Deryl", :TechNerd, 3], ["Naoman", :TechNerd, 3])

Head up the ladder prepared for a tough battle.

!battle(["Zero", :ZEL2, 0])

No field to worry about this time, just a fantastically put together mono-dark team of five with a PULSE monstrosity hiding in the back. Defeating Luna in the Glass Gauntlet should be adequate preparation for Zero's Pokemon: by now the core of Honchkrow, Weavile, and Umbreon should be familiar. Abusing Sucker Punch timing or faster priority to prevent a Honchkrow sweep, surviving a Weavile Ice Shard to kill it with something faster, and using a bulky Steel type to counter Umbreon are good places to start with these. Spiritomb plays a similar role to Umbreon, being bulky and punishing your physical attackers, but isn't too intense and can't do much to your own physical walls. Houndoom has a sash and likes to set up but isn't too bulky, meaning you can dent it then knock it out with some priority if you are able.

PULSE Clawitzer makes this fight a bit harder - he'll always send it out last. Although you may have a Pokemon able to withstand one base 120 Special-based attack, one use of any of three of its attacks will double its special attack thanks to Contrary. Another boost will basically allow it to eradicate any Pokemon you have. With its 252 base speed, you will not be able to outspeed it under normal circumstances at all, so it basically steamrolls most teams pretty easily. Therefore, the key to defeating Clawitzer is by taking advantage of the turns you have beforehand fighting Zero's other Pokemon to proactively put yourself into a winning condition. The obvious one you may think of by now is Trick Room - even if you're trading blow for blow, two or three really strong Dragon or Fairy type attacks will be able to knock it out, and you're basically guaranteed to go first in Trick Room, thanks to Clawitzer's insane speed stat. You can also take advantage of the first turn it is out, before it has any boosts, to suppress or change its ability: thereafter all of its moves except Origin Pulse will actually harm it, instead of helping it. Sturdy or Sash + Mirror Coat on a Pokemon with lots of HP may work too, just keep in mind it does have 252 base and max EV's in HP.

Once you defeat Zero, make your way back through the previous building. You'll notice some of the screens on the walls have changed, so keep in mind what they indicate. There are two secret numbers here: one is obvious, the other, not quite as much.

Back outside, talk to Taka and Solaris down from here if you are on Zekrom Route if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- On Zekrom Route only, talk to Taka and Solaris after PULSE Clawitzer (+2 Taka)

Anyways, head to the center of the city next. After this scene, head to the bottom-left side of the city. A path to a building at the bottom will now be open. Grab the hidden *Dire Hit* and head in. Talk to Eve in here to get some information about the next PULSE battle we'll be doing if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Eve about the upcoming PULSE battle (+1 Eve)

## Scarborough Quest

Before continuing, we can actually do one more quick quest. If you don't want to break up the current pace of the Labradorra siege you can come back to this quest, but I recommend it for some potentially helpful rewards for the next fight. Head to the building in the bottom-right side of Labradorra. Inside is a screen that we can use to enter passwords (we found these earlier). The first password is:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    2368
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the first password</a>
</div>

As a reward for inputting it, we can get the *Swampertite*! Very nice tool for a rain team. The second, harder to spot password is:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    3862
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the second password</a>
</div>

For inputting this one, we'll get a Sylveon, holding a *Ribbon Collar*.

Fly over to Jasper Ward and enter the second apartment from the left, on the bottom street. Talk to the attendant here to get access to the above floors. Head all the way to the top floor to get the *Fairium-Z*. Back down on the second floor, enter Apt. 2 and talk to the Gardevoir. Next, give the ribbon collar to Lottie to get the final one: *Department Store Sticker: Eevee*! Quite a sad story but hey, a nice reward.

!shop("Department Store Penthouse", ["Eviolite", "Leftovers", "Life Orb", "Focus Sash", "Exp. Share", "Weakness Policy", "Sitrus Berry", "Leppa Berry", "Reset Disc- ALL"])

There is also a person up here who will max out a Pokemon's friendship for $5000, which is nice.

In exchange for a Fresh Water, Soda Pop, and Lemonade, a child here will give you *TM25 Thunder*, *TM14 Blizzard*, and *TM38 Fire Blast*. Sweet.

In the bottom right side of the penthouse, there's a poor employee forced to battle us with a team of six Blissey, and you'll also get 20 *Exp. Candy XL* for each victory. You'll never need to grind anywhere else!

!battle(["Priscilla", :BEAUTY, 0])

## LCCC Second Visit

With that quest out of the way, fly on back to Labradorra City. Make your way to a building in the bottom left corner, where you will have a brief chat with Lin. Inside the building, climb down the ladder to enter the LCCC once more.

At the first fork, head up to get a hidden *Elixir* and 7 *Fairy Gems*. Back down from here, go down once you reach the next fork. Along this path you can get a hidden *Revive*, *Max Repel*, and *HP Up*. Talk to the computer here with a Data Chip in your bag to turn it on. Back in the area with the Fairy Gems, talk to the now-lit computer screen to open a door.

Back in the main hallway, proceed to the right until you come to a four-way junction. Up from here is a hidden *Oran Berry*. Follow the path down from here. By talking to the computer screens here we can follow this path into the Calcenon side of the LCCC. Up the ladder, grab the *Charizardite Y* and open a shortcut to Calcenon City.

Head back down to the LCCC, this time, going right at the four-way junction. Grab the hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Friend Ball* along the path, and prepare before proceeding. Time for yet another PULSE fight...

!dbattle(["Mime", :MIME, 0], ["Sigmund Connal", :FRIEND, 0], "Short-Circuit Field")

What a gut punch on a first playthrough - both in battle, and just in general! Ok, so the good news is: once the PULSE is dead, then you'll be able to 2v1 Sigmund's team. The bad news is, well, as you can see there are quite a lot of shenanigans going on here! The obvious one is that Mr. Mime has Wonder Guard and is Dark/Ghost type. Thankfully we're not in Gen 5 anymore and this means it's weak to Fairy type moves, but just that one type - everything else will clink off of him like an Iron Sword on an Armor Knight. On top of this, it has very high defensive stats and a healing move, meaning even if you are using Fairy-moves they may not be able to easily do the job. What's more: it also has Entrainment, and will almost always use it on Sigmund's ally Pokemon when it gets a chance, meaning Aromatisse and potentially more Pokemon will also get immunity from most moves. Although Mime has no attack power of its own, it just uses Instruct, granting Sigmund's Pokemon two uses total of his various field-boosted Electric, Ghost, and Fairy moves, so you'll likely be worn down and unable to really do anything against either Pokemon on the first attempt!

In my opinion, your first priority should be taking out the PULSE at all costs. Aromatisse does hit fairly hard, but a couple Pokemon with some special bulk should be able to stick around for a few turns to help you accomplish a win condition. The next issue is actually killing Mime. You can opt for some kind of set-up move or Fake Tears / Screech + Moonblast / Play Rough or similar strategies potentially, and may be able to outpace its healing capacities and bring it down. With the Fairy Gems we picked up and more notably the Fairy Z-Crystal, you can boost these attacks to get extra damage out of them that may do the trick. It is also susceptible to status and weather, so I recommend using Toxic on Mime during the first turn, and Aromatisse the second. Keep a sizable chunk of your team alive from here, and you'll eventually watch both of your opponents perish, then you can focus on taking out the rest of Sigmund's team. Mega Alakazam is particularly threatening as are Raichu and Electivire if you're unprepared for them.

Once you defeat this harrowing PULSE fight, exit the LCCC back into Labradorra. In the house where we previously talked to Eve, you can get the just-a-bit-too-late *PULSE Readout 9*.

Enter the building up and right from the LCCC, where we previously saw Sigmund run away from us. On the ground is a sparkling object, the *Orphanage Key*!

Flying over to the Lapis Ward, you can now access the Orphanage once again. Making your way to the top, you'll find the *Alakazite*.

## Labradorra Tournament of Booty

Make preparations for a sequence of battles, noting that you won't be able to leave during. Fly back to Labradorra once you're ready, and enter the large building at the top-left side of the city.

After a scene explaining what we're in for, well, I just hope you're ready. Note that you can buy vending machine drinks and Common Candies here if you need to. Talk to folks around the lobby if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices**
- Tell Victoria you think the tournament is wrong (+1 Victoria)
- Tell Victoria you think the tournament is not wrong (-1 Victoria)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Titania again, after she tells you to leave her alone (-1 Titania)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Noel in the lobby (+1 Noel)

Enter your open door, prepare your team, then head in for our first fight. Your partner will be Cal on Reshiram Route or Florinia in Zekrom Route.

!partner(["Cal", :REBORN, 3])

!partner(["Florinia", :FLORINIA, 2])

!dbattle(["Lumi", :LUMI, 0], ["Eve", :EVE, 0], "Inverse Field")

This is likely your first fight on the Inverse Field - a very straightforward field with two main effects: one, that the Magical Seed will boost all five stats and make you recharge, and two, that the type chart is inverted, explaining some of the weirder moveset choices on your opponents. Take care to think ahead in this fight about inverse type matchups, using TMs on your team if necessary to change up your movesets. Consider abusing the seed yourself if you're having a tough time.

Once you succeed, follow the path to the next area.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- On Reshiram Route only, talk to Cal, when the player is male (+1 Cal)

Prepare and head in to the next fight. The following two fights are fought in a different order depending on your route. Anyways:

If you're on Reshiram fight, this will be the first battle, on Zekrom, the second.

!battle(["Cal", :REBORN, 2], "Dragon's Den")

For our next fight with our pal Cal we get another glimpse at the Dragon's Den field, which boosts his Fire and Dragon moves and weakens your Water and Ice moves. You can still use Rock and Ground type moves to deal with his Fire types, just be careful of a Kommo-o setup and Mega Medicham.

If you're on Zekrom route, you'll get this fight next, and on Reshiram route you'll get it second:

!battle(["Florinia", :FLORINIA, 3], "Glitch Field")

Ah, the Glitch Field makes a return. Grass and Ground types generally have pretty good synergy with this field, and again you'll see familiar strategies here like Synthetic Seed bulk and Amnesia + Leaf Storm to ignore drops. Ferrothorn and Cradily can actually use their Special Defense as an attacking stat, so be cautious of those things. As with the Terra fight, curate a team specifically for success on Glitch, and you should be able to find a way through this one.

Once you've finished both fights, make your way further into the tournament, where Saphira's gym will become open!

## Treasure Badge

Enter Saphira's gym to the left, and talk to her in the corner. Next, familiarize yourself with the gym layout, and get the hidden *Quick Ball*, *Heart Scale*, and *PP Max* within. Proceed to the top of the area and talk to the chest.

**Relationship Point Choices:**

This conversation has tons of branches, so I made a flowchart. Note that all points here are for or against Saphira.

!img("saphira_points.jpg")

Next, you'll have to defend the chest against a barrage of Pokemon and Knight trainers. Between battles, you'll have time to open your bag and heal, so keep your PP and HP fresh so that you can successfully win every battle. As far as strategy to protect the chest, I recommend staying close to the chest at all times, and engaging foes as they come near you. In particular, watch out for Blaziken, who will appear almost out of nowhere from the bottom, and Zoroark, who sneaks in from the top. Some Pokemon will fly, and some will run at you. The Knights are slow, but have 3 Pokemon apiece, so make sure you are able to defeat them. Also, save often!

!battle(["Dan", :KNIGHT, 0], "Dragon's Den")

!battle(["Frey", :KNIGHT, 0], "Dragon's Den")

!battle(["Edgard", :KNIGHT, 0], "Dragon's Den")

!battle(["Kalezis", :KNIGHT, 0], "Dragon's Den")

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Lose the chest challenge the first time (-1 Saphira)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Exit the gym during the chest challenge (-1 Saphira)

Once you make it past the challengers in the gauntlet, you'll have one more:

!battle(["Gargantuan", :Steelix, 1], "Dragon's Den")

This guy is bulkier than normal: the 3252 EV's in HP is not a typo. A move like Endeavor can help solve that problem if you are really stuck here. Alternatively, Subzero Slammer transforms the field into Cave, where you can use Earthquake twice to end the fight.

Once you beat it, the path to Saphira will open. Time for our eighteenth and final gym battle!

!battle(["Saphira", :SAPHIRA, 0], "Dragon's Den")

Saphira's team doesn't pull punches: six of the best Dragon types in the game all boosted by the field effect. The Dragon Dances have double effectiveness, the Fire and Dragon moves have their effects doubled, and Noivern's seed boosts its Special Attack and gives it extra strong Flamethrower. On the defensive side, Dragonite's Multiscale takes away its Dragon weakness and all six of her Pokemon have 1.3x defense, on top of weakening your Ice moves. Two Sashes and Multiscale also make it near-impossible to one shot her Pokemon, as well. Garchomp will outspeed your team thanks to its Scarf, and not a single Pokemon is a slacker that will let you easily set up on it.

Since Dragon is super effective against Dragon, you can also take advantage of the field and try to beat her with your own Dragon types. A single Dragon Dance boost can often turn one of your Pokemon into a sweeper, and with the help of one layer of Stealth Rocks, Multiscale and Sashes will be broken, allowing you a clean sweep. Trick Room is helpful as always, as her Dragons are all pretty fast, so a slower Pokemon with Dragon moves could be the trick. You can also change the field to cave to wear her down with Rock moves, if you'd prefer.

Once you win, head down to the chest to get the *Treasure Badge* and *TM02 Dragon Claw*! That makes 18 badges and all 100 (+9) TMs. The cap also becomes Lv. 100!

## Escaping the Tournament

Talk to Florinia back in the lobby, in the top right corner. After a long scene, Terra will delete your fonts.

!battle(["T3RR4", :TERRA, 1], "Glitch Field")

First of all... the fonts are gone! Better hope you know which moveslot contains which move. Anyways, its the return of Terra's epic meme team, this time unshackled by the mono-ground restriction. Her Excadrill, Quagsire and Garchomp work as before basically. Chansey actually can attack on Glitch Field, and Porygon-Z likes to get an omniboost with its Z-Conversion. Then you have FEAR Donphan cleverly hiding its level behind the lack of fonts. 

Once you beat M3G4 T3RR4 once more, exit the tournament building via the path in the top left.

Some routes have a scene that plays here. Either way, you can now pet Sylveon for the quest. In fact, this is the last of the Eeveelutions, so if you've pet all of them so far, you can fly over to Spinel Town and talk to a girl in the right apartment building to get a *Choice Scarf* and the password *eeveeplease*.

Fly back to Victory Road. Inside the Pokemon Center, talk to an NPC who will send us on a quest. He'll give us the *Spirit Tracker*.

Before we enter Victory Road, there's actually one more tutor that we now have access to. Fly over to the Grand Hall and talk to the guy to your right.

!tutor("Move Tutor Lykos", [["Celebrate", "Free"], ["Happy Hour", "Free"]])

Fun fact: this NPC was put in the game in honor of forum user LykosHand, who frequently wishes users a happy birthday! I have probably received 5 or 6 of these messages to date; they always make me celebrate. Thanks, Lykos.

With all 18 badges, there is one more Default Mart update as well:

!shop("Default Mart (18 Badges)", ["Pok√© Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Escape Rope", "Full Heal", "Hyper Potion", "Ultra Potion", "Max Potion", "Full Restore", "Revive"])

## Victory Road

Fly on back, and head into the Victory Road.

!enc(783, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Entrance & Hubs)")

### Logic Puzzle 1

In the first room, you can get a hidden *Hyper Potion*, *HP Up*, and *Big Nugget*.

Enter the next room at the top. You'll notice a flashing sound and animation when you walk in this room - this indicates that there are still spirits on this map that we can fight. We will do the spirit fighting itself in a bit.

Head up the stairs to the right and pick up the hidden *Protein*. Talk to the map at the top of the hill to get a sneak peek on what, and who, awaits us on the right side of the room. When you're ready, push the nearby boulder onto the pressure pad. Head down the stairs, dodging Blake's Icicle Crash attacks as you go, then head to the top left of the room. Talk to the map here for another sneak peek at the rest of this large room, then enter the next room at the top.

Around the outsides of this room, you can find a hidden *Ice Gem* and *Blue Shard*. By sneaking around the bottom side of the room, you'll find the first of the spirits, who we can optionally fight. I won't post detailed strategy notes for these fights: use your knowledge of the fields and the Pokemon in your roster to grasp victory!

!battle(["Diana", :SPIRITF, 0], "Holy Field")

Defeating these spirits as we find them will allow us to obtain some decent rewards later on.

Anyways, to progress the story, talk to the machine in the upper left corner. We'll learn about our next task: Victory Road's first gem logic puzzle. You could use Pen & Paper to solve these - I find that a spreadsheet works the best for me. <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">You can download my go-to logic puzzle spreadsheet here.</a> I will provide each solution as well as explain how logically to reach them.

The clues this round are:

1. No two crystals share the same quality.
2. The Hardness of Ruby is 7.
3. Ruby is larger than Amethyst, but it is not the largest.
4. Amethyst's Purity is 'Middling.
5. The 'Pure' gem is Medium-sized.
6. Emerald is less pure than Ruby, but more pure than Sapphire.
7. The smallest gem is also the softest.
8. Sapphire's Hardness is less than Emerald's Hardness.
9. The largest gem is the least pure.

So, we can get to work. The spreadsheet can help you with this process.

Some of these hints are straightforward, but there are a few things that might not be as obvious here:

- From Clue 3, we notice that Ruby is larger than Amethyst, hence Ruby cannot be size 5, and Amethyst cannot be size 8. Since Ruby is not the largest, Ruby also cannot be size 8, so it is at most 7, meaning Amethyst cannot be size 7. Look for opportunities like these to rule out pairings.
- Clues 4 and 6 can actually entirely tell us the purity of the four gems. Clues comparing three gems are very helpful.
- Clues like 7 appear to not help us figure out which color is which property at first, but it also means you can automatically know that if Ruby is Small, then it is 5, and vice versa. On the spreadsheet, you can create a rectangle of "O"s, with a top line across the gem section at the top, and a bottom line going from the diagonal line to the final node. When you're stuck, try filling these in.
- You'll also notice throughout that in each 4-by-4 box, if any row or column has only 1 non-X space, you can automatically fill it in with an O.

Putting these steps together should get you a solution.

The solution for the first puzzle:

!img("vr_puzzle_1.jpg")

Once you finish, talk to Cal and show him the solution. Grab the hidden *X Sp. Atk* and proceed to the next room.

### The First Rail Puzzles

Be careful, as Blake will again drop Icicles on you that can harm your Pokemon. Climb the stairs to the right and follow the path to fight another spirit.

!battle(["Jonathan", :SPIRITM, 0], "Big Top Arena")

Back down the stairs, follow the path down this time. You'll see the first railcart puzzle of this section, this one is pretty easy to get you into it.

- Talk to the filled minecart at the top. It will move down and left.
- Switch both levers.
- Talk to the minecart again. It will go left and dump out its rocks, creating a shortcut to the start of the dungeon.
- Switch the left lever, then jump in the minecart and enter the next room.

!enc(786, nil, nil, "Victory Road (B1F & B2F)")

You can check out the map in this next room if you'd like.

!img("vr_mines_1.png")

Jump into this minecart (1) to proceed to the main part of this room, then go right to talk to Charlotte. Head left after the conversation to grab a hidden *Revive*. Time for another minecart puzzle.

- Jump into the minecart (3) towards the bottom left of the area. Switch the lever here (A).
- Jump back in the minecart (4). Pick up a hidden *Super Repel* and jump in the left minecart (6).
- Switch this lever (B) and jump back in the minecart (7).
- Follow the path down and right, then switch this lever (C).
- Jump back in the minecart (8), and reverse the steps until you reach the right side of the area (B, 7, 5).
- If you'd like, cross the tracks at the gold spots on the ground, and follow the Rock Climb path for a spirit fight (path in green).

!battle(["Lexi", :SPIRITF, 0], "Rainbow Field")

Anyways,

- Jump into the lower minecart (11) to reach the next area. Use Rock Climb here.
- You'll need to push this Strength boulder onto the pressure pad by going left, up, right, and up (save often).
- Go up through this new path, and switch the lever (D). Back down, jump into the top minecart (10).
- Switch this lever (E), then jump back into this minecart (13).
- Head back up above the pressure pad and switch this lever back (D), then go down and once more jump into the top minecart, following the path (10, 14).
- Push this strength boulder up twice.
- Head left between the two sets of stairs here. Follow this path to a hidden *Green Shard* and the *Tyranitarite*.
- From here, we'll actually need to back track all the way to the top left corner of the room. Aside from the boulder moving, you'll need to reverse all the steps we took to get here (15, 9, D, 10, E, 13, D, 10, 14, 6, B, 7, C, 8, B, 7, 5, A, 4).
- Push the boulder left, up, and onto the pressure pad.
- Switch the lever (F) in the newly opened path.
- Jump in the nearby minecart (2) to exit this room.

We'll be back in the main room from here. Again, Blake will be trying to hit us with Icicles, so be careful. Climb down the stairs, pushing boulders aside as you go. Climb up some rocks to get a hidden *Synthetic Seed*.

When you reach the section with tons of rocks, your goal will be to push the bottom right one to the right, to where the item ball containing the *Escape Rope* is. If you can do this, then you can walk down and push a rock onto a pressure pad. To do this, go down and right first, then slalom down and left, then finally go down and right again. Save beforehand to make sure you don't get stuck and have to actually use the Escape Rope! It should look something like this:

!img("vr_hub_1.png")

Follow the opened path downward, pushing a boulder one tile right onto the pad. Going up and around, push another boulder out of the way to its left, then go back up, left, and down to reach the bottom left. Grab the hidden *Ultra Potion* and jump into the minecart here. Push this lever, then jump back into this minecart.

Before we enter the door at the bottom, climb the rocks to the right and follow the path to another spirit.

!battle(["Fezz", :SPIRITM, 0], "Swamp Field")

Head back down and enter the door at the bottom. This puts us in the higher level of the previous room. Check out the map if you want, then exit through the door at the top.

### Exploding the Pillar

!enc(792, nil, nil, "Victory Road (2F & Charous Mountain)")

Talk to Charlotte, then head up. You can find a hidden *Calcium* here. Check the map if you like.

!img("vr_2f_1.png")

Go right and down from the map and follow this path (blue). At the fork, use Blast Powder on the rock blocking the rock climb path, then follow the path all the way to a *PP All*.

Backtrack to the fork, this time going left (green). On the hill is a spirit.

!battle(["Kamina", :SPIRITM, 0], "Chess Board")

Backtrack to the center of the room.

Up and left from the map, you'll see another rock climb path fork. Climb the rocks to your right (yellow). Grab the hidden *Blue Shard* and climb up to fight another spirit.

!battle(["Cloud", :SPIRITM, 0], "Underwater Field")

Back at the fork, go left (orange), picking up the hidden *Swift Wing* along the way. You'll see another fork as you go - go left again. Follow the path to the *Kommonium-Z*!

Back at the fork, cross the tracks (red). Follow the path to a hidden *Heart Scale* and another spirit.

!battle(["Trevor", :SPIRITM, 0], "Rainbow Field")

Return to the center of the room, and make your way to the right. There are four minecarts here - we will need to take all four of these, though we can do it in any order. I will start by jumping in the bottom minecart (D).

When you land, Blake will be shooting Icicles at us once more. Start by pushing the nearby boulder up as much as it will go, then hop into the minecart. Push the boulder left and up onto the pressure pad, hop back in the minecart, switch the lever, and hop in the minecart again.

In the basement, our goal will be to successfully push the minecart full of explosives into the pillar in the top left corner. To accomplish this, we'll need a straight track from the start to the pillar, since any intermediate positions will cause it to bounce back. The steps for this room are:

!img("vr_mines_se.png")

- Push the nearby boulder up and out of the way. You can grab a hidden *Electric Gem* via the Rock Climb path. Don't jump down the ledge though, climb back down.
- Switch the bottom lever (A). Go around the bottom of the tracks, then proceed up from here. Smash the rock and push the left boulder to the left.
- Head back down to the bottom and switch the second and third levers from the bottom (B, C).
- Go up and left, and press the top-left lever (E).
- Cross the tracks to the left, go down, and follow the now-opened path to the right. Push the right boulder down twice. Switch the nearby lever (D).
- Switch off the lever in the top left (E).
- Following the left path, head back to the bottom of this area. Flip the bottom switch (A).
- Talk to the minecart. It should explode the pillar. Switch the bottom lever (A) once more and make the long way around to return to the rock climb spot. Follow the path down, around, and out - grabbing the hidden *Purple Shard* along the way.

That's it for this portion - head up and return to Charlotte's room. We have to pick another minecart: I will do the left one (L) this time. Once again, beware of Blake's Icicles when you land.

In the bottom left, you can get a hidden *Blue Shard* by Rock Climb. Don't jump down the ledge though. There is a boulder in the right side, we will need to push it onto the pressure pad at the bottom. Unfortunately the gems and rocks in the center of the room are in the way - you'll need to push it to the top left corner before it can successfully go down and onto the pressure pad. Jump into the minecart.

This room has a similar puzzle to the previous, though this time the explosives can stop at intermediate points. The solution:

!img("vr_mines_sw.png")

- Switch the top left lever (A) then push the minecart. Switch this lever back.
- Switch the bottom left lever (B), then go right and switch the bottom right lever (C).
- Switch the now-opened lever in the top right (D), then the top middle lever (E).
- Push the minecart. Switch the bottom-right lever (B) and push the minecart again.
- Switch the bottom left lever (B) in order to switch off the bottom right lever (C), then push the minecart. Switch off the bottom right lever (C).
- Switch off the top right lever (D), then push the minecart and switch the lever (D) back.
- Switch both of the leftmost levers on top (A, E) and push the minecart. Follow it up, going around the right side of the room to reach the cart.
- Switch the first lever you reach (F) and push the cart. Repeat this for the top lever (G) by going all the way around, and the pillar will explode once more.
- Climb down the rocks on the left side to exit.

Make your way back to Charlotte's room and choose a new minecart: I will do the one on the right (R).

There is a substantial puzzle in Blake's Icicle hell, so be careful. The steps:

- Jump in the cart and flip the nearby lever. Jump in the cart to the left.
- Push the boulder to the right, and grab a hidden *Max Repel* up above.
- Jump back into the minecart at the bottom. Transfer to the other minecart.
- From here, push the filled cart. Make your way back to the top left corner.
- Flip the nearby switch and talk to the filled cart. Use Rock Climb on the path that opens to reach the basement once more.

!img("vr_mines_ne.png")

Time for another "strength puzzle that takes way longer than it seems it should". This time, you'll need to move the boulder that starts on top into the center of the track loop. To do this, continually move it clockwise around the loop, pushing it inward whenever you can without it getting stuck. You'll need to do a lot of track-crossing to succeed. The good news is: once you get it onto the pressure pad, the explosives will ram into the pillar with a simple push. Exit in the bottom right.

One more path to go down: take the top minecart (U) in Charlotte's room.

In this next room, you'll need to push both boulders to the left: one above, one below. The final move for each has to be made from the other side. Solve each rock fully one-at-a-time, then climb down into the pit.

!img("vr_mines_nw.png")

In this room, you'll need to load carts with rocks, dumping it to create climbing paths. The solution:

- Switch the first lever (A) and jump in the cart. Fill it with rocks. Switch the lever (A) back and push the cart down.
- Head down and take the cart back up. Fill it with rocks once more.
- Switch the two levers below (A, B). Push the cart again, then follow it down and ride it back up. Fill it up!
- Switch the bottom lever (C), then make your way back up to the cart. Push it down.
- Climb down all the rocks and push the explosives into the pillar.

Climb down to the left, then go up and talk to Charlotte. We have successfully destroyed the pillar!

### Logic Puzzle 2

Make your way down two rooms, to the large room where Icicles rained down. Take the cart up, then go slightly up and to the right over the rock climbs. After talking to Charlotte, go right. Grab the hidden *Purple Shard*. Enter the next cave. After seeing a conversation and avoiding Fern's arrows, enter the cave at the top.

There is a hidden *Max Potion* and *Green Shard* in this room. Anyways, time for our second logic puzzle. The hints and <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">spreadsheet</a> from the previous puzzle should be useful here as well, note that there are more categories this time.
The clues:

1. No two crystals share any same quality.
2. The second hardest gem is 'Pure'.
3. Ruby has more Foliation than, and is larger than, Sapphire.
4. Sapphire is more pure than Amethyst.
5. The third hardest gem is of 'Middling' Purity.
6. Neither Emerald nor Amethyst is either the least or most pure.
7. The hardest gem has the most Foliation.
8. Sapphire has less Foliation than the 'Pure' gem, which has less Foliation than Amethyst.
9. The softest gem is the smallest one.
10. Emerald is smaller than Ruby, which is smaller than Amethyst.

The solution:

!img("vr_puzzle_2.jpg")

Grab the hidden *Muscle Wing* in the bottom right corner and return to the arrow hell room. In here, you'll need to push boulders out of the way. Save often, and turning off super speed for your sanity. Note that when you reach two pressure pads, push the boulder up once, climb around, then push it down twice to proceed. Along this path you'll get a *Max Revive* and hidden *X Sp. Def* and *Ultra Potion*.

You'll need to push boulders along the path into specific places and push one more onto a pressure pad and... yeah. We trap ourselves. Thankfully we get rescued by cart! Grab the hidden *Green Shard* and enter the next room.

### The Final Rail Puzzle

Pick up the hidden *Red-Hots* and *Fire Gem* in this area. Time for yet another massive rail puzzle. 

!img("vr_mines_final.png")

- Jump into the railcart on the bottom (1). Climb the nearby rocks to get a hidden *Red Shard*.
- There will now be three railcarts all in the same area. Jump into the middle one (3) to reach a spirit.

!battle(["Leo", :SPIRITM, 0], "Chess Board")

Anyways, back to the puzzle.

- Take this minecart back (4), then jump into the top minecart (5). Smash the nearby rock but ignore the boulder for now.
- Take the minecart (6) back up, and jump into the bottom of three minecarts (2). From here, jump into the other minecart, on the upper right side (7). Grab the hidden *Red Shard*.
- Push the boulder down and right onto the pressure pad, then take the minecart (8) back to the right. 
- There is a path to the left across some tracks that lead to a lever (A): switch it.
- Jump into the bottom minecart (1), and it will take you to another lever (B): switch it.
- Use the cart (9) to go back down, then switch off the first lever (A).
- Jump into the bottom cart (1) one more, then into the top of three minecarts (5). To your right is a lever (C): switch it.
- Jump back into this minecart (6), then into the middle of three minecarts (3). This will take you to a pile of rocks (10) - fill the cart, then push it.
- Climb down the rocks and jump into the top minecart (5). Switch off the lever (C) to your right. 
- Go up from the boulder in the bottom left corner, and cross the long line of tracks (yellow arrows). This will lead you to another lever (D) - switch it. Head left and up from here to get a hidden *PP Up*.
- Jump back in the minecart in the bottom left (6), then push the cart full of rocks (3).
- Jump into the top minecart (5), then follow the path up and left from the boulder across the tracks (yellow arrows) once more. You'll now see a new climbable path - take it, then talk to the explosives.
- Push the cart full of explosives (11), then push the lever (D) across the tracks on the right.
- Make your way to the bottom left corner. Jump into the minecart (6) to return to the top left corner. Talk to the filled cart to make an explosion!
- Jump into the bottom minecart (2). From here, go left and up, pushing the lever (A). Take the minecart (1) to reach the top right side of the area, where you can finally exit (12)!

### Introduction to the Gem Chambers

The next room I will call the "central gem room". In the central gem room, climb down either rock. You can get a hidden *Elemental Seed* here. Climb the rocks on the left side of this area. You can get a hidden *Max Repel*. Enter the Sapphire area in the top left corner.

!enc(800, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Sapphire B3F)")

Grab the hidden *Chewing Gum*. You'll notice a rock climb path on the left side of the room - follow it to reach a spirit.

!battle(["Savage", :SPIRITM, 0], "Water Surface")

Fun fact about this one: apparently when Savage challenged the Reborn League back in the day, Shade used a Shedinja. Wonder why Savage went mad.

Use the Blue Crystal Key atop the central hill to create a path in the ice puzzle. Cross this path (D L U R D L D) and grab a hidden *Cheri Berry*. Proceed to the next room.

!enc(801, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Emerald B3F)")

Pick up the hidden *Green Shard* and *Cotton Candy*, then use the Green Crystal Key atop the central hill. Climb up to the right and exit back into the central gem room.

Grab a hidden *Hyper Potion*, then use Strength to push the boulder onto the pressure pad. After this is done, make your way to the right side of the central gem room, grab the hidden *Red Shard*, and enter the Ruby room.

!enc(799, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Ruby B3F)")

Use the Red Crystal Key and follow the path. You can get a hidden *Zinc* on your way out.

!enc(802, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Amethyst B3F)")

Grab the hidden *Telluric Seed* and *Fairy Gem*, then use the Purple Crystal Key. Climb up and out to the left.

Back in the central gem room, push the boulder into place then pick up the hidden *Swift Wing*. Climb to the center of the central gem room and go down through the now-opened gates. Use the levers to open some shortcuts. Follow this path to the next room.

### Logic Puzzle 3

We're back in the room with the massive rail puzzle - but worry not, as we don't have to do any more railing for now. Pick up the hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Heart Scale*, *Star Piece*, and *Max Elixir* as you proceed through the path and into the next room.

We'll find ourselves on an upper path of the room where Fern tried to hit us with arrows. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and proceed to the next room.

We'll find ourselves in Charous Mountain. After a conversation, proceed through this room. Grab a hidden *Ice Heal* along the way.

Enter the next room and grab the hidden *Magical Seed*. Pick up the hidden *Max Elixir* and *Purple Shard* in the rest of the room after another conversation.

Oh boy, it's time for another logic puzzle - this time with five categories. Download the <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">spreadsheet</a> if you'd like. Hope you're ready.

The clues:

1. No two crystals share the same quality.
2. Ruby is bigger than Sapphire.
3. Sapphire's Purity is less than Ruby's Purity, which is less than Amethyst's Purity.
4. Amethyst does not have 'Vitreous' Luster.
5. Ruby is more lustrous than Amethyst, which is more lustrous than Sapphire.
6. Amethyst is not 'Miniscule'.
7. Ruby has less Foliation than Sapphire.
8. The largest gem is more lustrous than the smallest gem.
9. The gem with 'Difficult' Foliation is smaller than Emerald.
10. Amethyst has 'Eminent' Foliation.
11. The gems are, in order of ascending hardness: the 'Medium' gem, the 'Middling' Purity gem, the gem with the least foliation, and the 'Pearly' gem.
12. The 'Indistinct' gem is also the least pure.

The solution:

!img("vr_puzzle_3.jpg")

Enter the door at the bottom to return to Charous Mountain once you're done.

Grab the hidden *Elemental Seed*. At the fork, go down to grab a hidden *Calcium* and fight another spirit.

!battle(["Owen", :SPIRITM, 0], "Desert Field")

Head back up to the fork and go right. After a few more climbs you'll find another fork. Going right will lead you to another spirit.

!battle(["Duster", :SPIRITM, 0], "Big Top Arena")

Continue along the path from here. Grab the hidden *Max Ether* along the way. Exit the mountain to reach Charous Path.

!enc(794)

Another mostly linear path. At the fork, go left to get a hidden *Ultra Potion* and fight a spirit.

!battle(["Jonah", :SPIRITM, 0], "Fairy Tale Field")

Back at the fork, go up and left. Grab a hidden *Ultra Ball* as you proceed. Enter the next room for another logic puzzle!

### Logic Puzzle 4

Grab a hidden *X Attack* in here. If you follow a path on the right side up and over the machines, you can find the *Gengarite* as well as another spirit.

!battle(["Zippo", :SPIRITM, 0], "Icy Field")

Head back down to the main part of the room: there is another logic puzzle waiting for us... And this one, is a doozy. If you have managed to avoid using the <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">spreadsheet</a> by now, I recommend it.

The clues:

1. No two crystals share any same quality.
2. The Habit of the second hardest gem is less than the Habit of the 'Pure' gem, which is less than the Habit of the Emerald.
3. The Purity of the 'Vitreous' gem is less than the Purity of Emerald, which is less than the Purity of the 'Pearly' gem.
4. The Luster of the 'Miniscule' gem is less than the Luster of the 'Medium' gem, which is less than the Luster of the 'Hexagonal' gem.
5. The Hardness of the 'Small' gem is less than the Hardness of the Amethyst, which is less than the Hardness of the 'Pure' gem.
6. The 'Middling' Purity gem's Luster is less than the Luster of the 'Medium' gem.
7. The Foliation of the 'Pearly' gem is less than the Foliation of the 'Vitreous' gem which is less than the Foliation of the 'Silky' gem.
8. The Habit of the 'Silky' gem is less than the Habit of the most pure gem.
9. The Size of the 'Impure' gem is less than the Size of the 'Perfect' Foliation gem, which is less than the Size of the Sapphire.
10. The Foliation of Amethyst is less than the Foliation of the second hardest gem, which is less than the Foliation of the Sapphire.

The solution:

!img("vr_puzzle_4.jpg")

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Solve Logic Puzzle 4 in five or fewer tries (+1 Radomus)
- Attempt the logic puzzle incorrectly six times, causing Radomus to solve it (-1 Radomus)

Grab the hidden *Max Revive* beyond the gate and proceed to the next room.

### Dropping the Stalactite

We'll find ourselves back in the previous hub room where Fern is, but on the highest level. Go down the path and talk to Hardy here, and the stalactite will be dropped. Back to the left, a new path will be opened up. Left and up from here, you can get a hidden *Synthetic Seed* and fight a spirit.

!battle(["Quinn", :SPIRITM, 0], "Inverse Field")

Head down from here, and you'll find yourself in the left side of this large room. Down from here you can find rocks to climb to proceed to the right. Grab a hidden *Dusk Ball* here, then go down the rocks on the bottom. The cave entrance here is just a shortcut to a previous area, so go to the right instead. Pick up the hidden *Magical Seed* and fight another spirit.

!battle(["Troy", :SPIRITM, 0], "Mountain Field")

Make your way back to the center of the room and continue climbing rocks up and to the right. To the right of where Fern trapped us, get a hidden *Ultra Potion* then climb up and grab the hidden *Muscle Wing*. Exit out to a lower section of Charous Path.

When you reach a fork, go down the rocks to get the *Metagrossite*! Back on the main path is a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Calcium*, and *Pok√©Snax*.

At the bridge, on Zekrom route, you'll see a story sequence play out. On Reshiram route, you'll obtain Taka's Chatot. Grab the *Purple Shard* and continue into the next room.

### Fire & Ice Room

!enc(796, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Final Rooms)")

I'll call this room the 7-gem puzzle room. grab the hidden *Iron*, *Full Restore*, and *Rare Candy*. Before proceeding with the main path of Victory Road, there is one side area we can go to. On the right side of this room, you'll see a path that leads to the bottom right corner, where you can fight a spirit.

!battle(["King", :SPIRITM, 0], "Desert Field")

Climb the nearby rocks to enter the side area.

!enc(797, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Fire & Ice Room)")

Grab the hidden *Burn Heal* and *Fairy Gem* in the starting area.

Make your way onto the ice on the left side of the area, and loop your way all the way around to activate the Blue Crystal. 

Back on the land, head to the right side of the area and grab the three *Glitter Balls*, then activate the Red Crystal.

Next, proceed through the red rock and ice bridge path that is now to your right. Push the nearby strength boulder down so it is out of the way, then return to the Red Crystal and activate it again.

Down and left, a new path will be opened up. Climb down onto the ice, grab hidden *Ice Heal* at the bottom, then use the rightmost Rock Climb spot to go up and left to activate another Blue Crystal. Return to the left side of the room to grab the *Lucarionite* and fight another spirit.

!battle(["Franz", :SPIRITM, 0], "Chess Board")

With that, return to the 7-gem puzzle room.

### The Ruby Chamber

Step on the panel towards the top and talk to Florinia. Heading down from here, a warp tile will appear. Take it to return to the central gem room from earlier.

We need to return to each of the four gem rooms we were in earlier. I will start with Ruby, in the top right corner.

Use the Red Crystal Key and go up. Grab the hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Proceed to the next room.

!enc(803, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Ruby B4F & B5F)")

Pick up the hidden *HP Up* here. As you might expect, it's time for a larger puzzle involving the Red Crystals that move rock climb spots around.

!img("vr_ruby.png")

- Climb to the right and push the boulder left, out of the way. Climb back down, activate the first red crystal (1), then go right and follow the path.
- Activate the crystal on the hill (2), then go right and activate the next crystal (3). Reset the previous one (2) so you can go left up both rocks.
- Follow this path to the left. You'll reach another crystal (4): activate it. To proceed, you'll need to double back around the bottom side of the room (through 1, 2, 3)
- Activate both crystals (5, 6) you find in the next area. Follow the path this creates, then use the left crystal again (5) to create a new path to the left. Follow it up.
- Push the boulder down twice to get it out of the way here, then activate the nearby crystal (7). You'll have to go down, activate the left crystal (5) again, then and make your way back up. Past the boulder, there should be a new path in the top left to follow (7, using the rock climb near 9). Down from here is a spirit.

!battle(["Godot", :SPIRITM, 0], "Burning Field")

Continuing with the puzzle:

- Up and left, activate another crystal (8). Once more, we'll have to drop down and make our way all the way back around the bottom right side of the room (using the climbs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9)...
- Climb the new set of rocks (8), but don't go up the one to the left quite yet, instead, head up and rock climb towards the center of the room. Activate the crystal on the left (9).
- Back down and left (towards 8), climb up on the left side, going clockwise around the room. Down a rock climb, activate a crystal (10).
- Make your way back to the left side of the room via going towards the previous climbs (past 9 and 8) and go up to get 3 *Glitter Balls*!
- Heading back up towards the top of the room (above 8 and below 9), take the rocks generated previously by using the crystal (9) to go down towards the center of the room. 
- Use the two crystals here (11, then 12 twice from two different angles, then 11 again) to navigate around the center of the area, grabbing a hidden *Dragon Gem* in the middle, then go right. Grab the hidden *Escape Rope*.
- Climb down the lower rocks (at 13) to push the rock onto the pressure pad, then activate the crystal (13). Follow the path to the right side of the area.
- Again, you'll use two sets of two crystals each to maneuver through this area (14, 6, 14 again).
- Climb up from here. You'll need to activate two crystals here (15, 16), then head up and down the ledge. Backtrack through the center using the crystal by the pressure plate (13) to return to the bottom right side.
- Activate the crystal in the way (15), then follow the path made earlier (16). Creep along the right side as you go up, and grab a hidden *Purple Shard*. Before entering the cave, follow the path on the right side down to reach another spirit.

!battle(["Allan", :SPIRITM, 0], "Psychic Terrain")

This is the first fight in the game with natural Psychic Terrain. Thankfully it's not too crazy for now... just wait until the postgame!

Anyways, return to the top right corner to enter B5F. Prepare for a fight.

!battle(["Sirius", :Sirius, 2], "Dragon's Den")

Our final fight with this guy is a toughie. His leads employ double strategies like Intimidate + Lightning Rod + Discharge. Notably his Tyrantrum makes amazing use of the field - one Dragon Dance will boost it to +2, making it able to OHKO most of your Pokemon with ease. However, with good doubles strategies and/or a bit of Dragon move spam, you can surely defeat Paul Clark from accounting.

After winning, you'll be free to explore this room. Make sure you grab the 3 *Ruby Stars* before leaving, as we'll need those. Oh, and get the hidden *Big Nugget* too. Take the warp point back to the central gem room!

### The Sapphire Chamber

Use one of the three conveniently placed Light Shards if you want, and make your way to the Sapphire room in the top left. Pick up the hidden *Max Ether* and proceed into the door at the top.

!enc(804, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Sapphire B4F & B5F)")

In this room, we have to use Blue Crystals to open up spots on the ice for navigation. There's a crystal to the left: use it to make a path across the ice, then cross (L D L) and climb up.

!img("vr_sapphire_1.png")

Grab the hidden *Magical Seed* then enter the next ice puzzle. You'll need to first make your way to the very bottom of the ice (L D R U R D R U L D L D), climb up, and activate the crystal. Before proceeding, there is a sneaky rock climb path on the right side here leading to a spirit.

!battle(["Josh", :SPIRITM, 0], "Big Top Arena")

Anyways, back down on the puzzle, we can now reach the top middle to activate another crystal (R U R D L U). This lets you get to the top left and escape (D L D R D L U L).

Head right, picking up the hidden *Blue Shard*. This next ice sheet is massive, so here's a step by step guide for this part:

!img("vr_sapphire_2.png")

- L U L D R D R U L, activate the crystal (1) at the top of the hill, then climb back down.
- R D L U L U2 L U L U L D R U L U L D L, activate crystal (2).
- D R U R D, activate crystal (3).
- U R D L U R U R D R D R D R D R (now at the starting tile) U L D L U R U L U R D L U R, activate crystal (4).
- L D R U L U L D R D L U R U R D R D R D R D R (now at the starting tile) U L D L U L U L U L D, activate crystal (5).
- R D L2 U L U R D L D R U R, climb up. Grab the hidden *Guard Spec*.

Head into the next room when you're ready.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Blake you will get in his way (-1 Blake)
- Tell Blake you won't get in his way (+1 Blake)

!battle(["Blake", :BLAKE, 2], "Icy Field")

One more round with this guy too. Unfortunately for us, his team of Water and Ice types doesn't mess around, combining two of the best offensive types with a field effect that lets them stack speed on you, power up their attacks, neutralize Fire and Rock moves easily, and more. This time, the field isn't stacked on top of a Water Surface, so you can't burn it away. Fighting and Electric moves are generally good keys to victory for this fight, especially if you have some priority moves that help you boost your speed and Brick Break to knock out his screens.

Grab the hidden *Heart Scale* and *Protein* as well as the three *Sapphire Stars*, then warp back.

### The Emerald Chamber

Enter the Emerald room in the bottom left next.

Grab the hidden *Max Elixir* and exit at the bottom.

In this next room, pick up the hidden *Repel* and *Ultra Ball*. There is a path along the bottom that will take you to a Green Crystal: activate it.

!img("vr_emerald.png")

Head to the middle of the room and climb down, then activate the Green Crystal. Fern will start firing arrows at us. Once you get control, turn off speed up for your sanity, then start avoiding the arrows. If you get hit by one, it will drag you backwards, and deal damage to your team. There is a Light Shard at the bottom of the room. Since your Pokemon won't die from the arrows, might as well solve most of the puzzle before using the Shard. Oh, and there's a hidden *Genius Wing* on the left side if you have an opportunity to grab it.

On the left side of the area, climb the ivy (1) to follow the path we made earlier to a spirit.

!battle(["Nate", :SPIRITM, 0], "Desert Field")

To defeat Fern in this room:

- Back down in the main area, follow the ground-level path (2) on the left side. Push the boulder up, right, and up, onto the pressure pad.
- Next, follow the second ground-level path (4) from the left up, and pull the lever.
- Climb the ivy between these two paths (3) and go up. Push the lever, then talk to the Crystal to deal the first blow to Decidueye.
- Climb the next ivy to the right (5), and activate this lever.
- Go to the third ground-level path from the left (6) and go up. Pull the lever at its end.
- Head over to the rightmost ground-level path (12), go up, and switch the lever.
- Climb the second-from-the-right ivy (9), and switch the lever.
- In the bottom left side of the area, there is a boulder. You'll need to push it right and up the second from the right ground-level path (10) onto a pressure plate at the top.
- This will open up the path up from the rightmost ivy (11). Follow it, switch the lever, and activate the crystal to deal the second blow to Decidueye.
- Finally, the middle ivy path (7) will be open. Follow it to the crystal and deliver the last blow to Decidueye.

With that out of the way, now is a great chance to use the Light Shard! You can now take the long path (8) up to the top of the room. Grab the hidden *Grass Gem*, then climb the rocks on the right side of the top of the room to reach another spirit.

!battle(["Taro", :SPIRITM, 0], "Ashen Beach")

Back down the rocks, enter the door at the top.

!enc(809, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Emerald B5F)")

Grab the hidden *Max Repel*, *Magical Seed*, *Green Shard*, and the 3 *Emerald Stars*. You can also find one more spirit by climbing a hill in the middle and using the Green Crystal Key.

!battle(["Tenshi", :SPIRITM, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Use the warp tile to return to the central gem room.

### The Amethyst Chamber

Finally, head over to the Amethyst room in the bottom right corner. Pickup the hidden *Max Ether* and proceed into the room at the bottom.

Grab the hidden *Calcium* near the start, then prepare yourself for what's to come! Basically, you'll need to dodge the void, which aims for you. Getting hit by it will send you back to the start, unfortunately. To proceed in each area, look for the Purple Crystal and get the void to land on top of it.

More tips: don't use speedup, don't use repels, since the "another?" message will actually cause you to be a sitting duck for the void; there aren't wild Pokemon here. Create straight lines for the void to follow onto the crystals to make it more predictable. Finally, save often!

Once you exit the room at the bottom successfully, you can return to the previous room, where you will no longer be chased. In here we can find a hidden *Protein* and *Carbos*.

!img("vr_amethyst.png")

Towards the top of the room, you can follow a rock climb path to the *Salamencite*!

In the bottom left side of the room, we can access a path that takes us up some rocks and to a spirit.

!battle(["Ikaru", :SPIRITM, 0], "Psychic Terrain")

Once you're done, enter the room at the bottom right.

!enc(810, nil, nil, "Victory Road (Amethyst B5F)")

Pick up the hidden *PP Up*, *Max Revive*, *Hyper Potion*, and the 3 *Amethyst Stars*. Return to the central gem room via the new warp.

### Victory over Victory Road

Back in the central gem room, take the warp back to Florinia. You'll need to place 7 of the 12 stars into the slots, then step on the tile above. On the left side, you'll see gems light up gold corresponding to the number of correct stars you've picked. On the right, you'll see gems light up silver corresponding to the correct orientation of the gems.

And... it's actually random what the correct answer is per save file, so I can't just give you the solution this time.

Solving this thankfully isn't too bad (especially compared to the last Logic Puzzle we did...) since we have infinite tries. What I like to do is place all 3 Ruby Stars in, and see how many light up. Take away all but that number of Ruby Stars, then move them around until the right side lights up with the same number. Repeat this for Sapphire Stars next, knowing that the Ruby gems are correct. Emerald can then assume Ruby and Sapphire are correct... so it's pretty simple from here. Soon you'll be done!

Enter the next room and pick up the hidden *Full Heal*. Once you're ready for a tough fight, head up and right.

!battle(["Fern", :Hotshot, 7], "Crystal Cavern")

One more round with our favorite Swag Jockey. His team is pimped out for maximal pain on the field, which... aside from an early game Aster & Eclipse fight and Ditto-Arceus, we haven't gotten to fight any significant trainers on. Three of his Pokemon have Rock Tomb, which gets a 2.25x power boost here and alternate hitting with Fire, Water, Grass, then Psychic sub-typing, cyclically. Any Pokemon's use of a Rock move, Multi-Attack, Strength, or Rock Climb will cause the sub-typing to move to the next, in fact. Dragon moves are also boosted here, so Haxorus (perhaps after a Dragon Dance), Krookodile (who will outspeed with its Scarf) and Serperior (perhaps after a Contrary Leaf Storm) will tear through you with theirs. Rhyperior's Rock Polish actually also boosts both attacking stats on this field, so if you can't take it out in the first turn, it might sweep you. It's also worth noting that Krookodile's Earthquake will turn the field to a Cave, where this move can now hit Flying type Pokemon you were hoping to switch in on it. Oh, and he has a Bullet Punch machine in Mega Scizor and a Z-Move 'roided Decidueye with priority.

By now, I know you can win this one! Aside from a generally well-built team, Pokemon that make careful use of the moves I mentioned earlier to gain beneficial sub-typings and ruin Fern's sub-typings can be useful here. Dragon types can fairly easily sweep here if you can get some momentum and Stealth Rocks going, as well. Transform it into the Dark Crystal Cavern or Cave if you like those options better.

Once you win, proceed to the right. Before we leave though, there is one last spirit that we can fight - hug the bottom wall as you go right to reach them. Grab the hidden *Ultra Potion* while you're here.

!battle(["Saya", :SPIRITF, 0], "Glitch Field")

Make your way to the exit, grabbing the final hidden item of Victory Road... a *Blue Shard*. Exciting.

In the outside area in which you emerge, hug the bottom wall to pick up the *New World Field Readout*. Study up!

Head into the Pokemon Center up and to the right, and talk to the girl behind the counter to learn a bit about Reborn's Elite Four.

Before we do that, however, fly on over to the other side of Victory Road, just north of Labradorra. If you've been fighting the spirits, we can get rewards for doing so! Talk to Azer.

|Reward                                             |Number of Spirits Collected    |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|*Choice Specs*, *Steelium-Z*                       |5+                             |
|*Choice Band*, *Flyinium-Z*                        |10+                            |
|*Choice Scarf*, *Fightinium-Z*                     |15+                            |

|*Catching Charm: Emerald*, *Life Orb*, *Leftovers* |25                             |

You'll also get the *Exp. All* for catching all the spirits if you haven't obtained it yet.

With that taken care of... that's really it. Every Pokemon, Mega Stone, Z-Crystal, hold item, TM... aside from those that relate to Legendary Pokemon, we now have 'em all. Nothing else is holding us back from finally doing this thing. Fly on back to Charous Mountain in the top right corner of the region and prepare yourself as best you can for what's to come.

## Reborn Elite Four & Champion

Enter the Charous Hall, to the right of the Pokemon Center. Reminisce on the eighteen gyms you've beaten as you head up! Once you pass into the door at the top, you'll be unable to return, so make sure you're ready.

!battle(["Heather", :HEATHER, 0], "Mountain Field")

Do you remember when we fought Corey, obtained the Silver Ring, and later found five of his six Pokemon? Now we know where his Crobat went. Fittingly, Heather uses Flying and Poison type Pokemon.

On this field, Tailwind lasts for five turns and sets up Strong Winds. Crobat's speed and its Sash means you're not going to be able to easily steamroll with Ice, Electric, and Rock type moves once it gets off Tailwind. Archeops, another fast Pokemon, also has this move for support. Flying moves and Rock moves are all boosted here, meaning Crobat, Archeops, Gyarados with its Z-Crystal, and Salamence will all hit like trucks. Additionally, her Gengar's Icy Wind and Ominous Wind are boosted by 1.5x on this field, then again by 1.5x whenever Strong Winds are present. Oh, and Thunder never misses. A very tough optimized fight, but nothing too unexpected for Reborn's Elite Four.

It's hard to recommend changing up your team specifically for this fight, because you have to bring the same team through the entire Elite Four. Still, if you are stuck on this fight, there are a lot of things you can use. For example, while Strong Winds do neutralize Flying type weaknesses, you can use the Thunder, Icy Wind, Hyper Voice, and Rock move boosts yourself to narrow the gap. Especially once Crobat and Archeops are down, that may be the way to victory. Trick Room will also help you turn Tailwind on its head if need be, where a Pokemon like Decidueye with a 1.5x attack boost from Long Reach may be able to sweep. You can also use your own Flying types to deal massive damage: Talonflame's Gale Wings is always on while Strong Winds are on, for example. Alternatively, you could consider switching the field to Snowy Mountain via the Blizzard TM if you want to use Ice moves more effectively.

Once you win, you'll get the *Ruby Ring*. Proceed to the next room.

!battle(["Bennett & Laura", :BENNETTLAURA, 0], "Flower Garden")

Good news: it's not a 12v6. Bad news: Bennett and Laura use Bug and Grass types on the most broken field effect in the game that we haven't yet seen even once: Flower Garden, with natural Rain to boot. Flower Garden has 5 stages, each stage essentially being more beneficial for their team than the last. It starts at Stage 1, but the Synthetic Seeds on the leads will automatically bump it up to Stage 3. Three more seeds in the back, Venusaur's Bloom Doom, Lilligant's Growth, and three Pokemons' Nature Power (which becomes Growth) will each up the stage. Swarm will always be on, boosting Volcarona and Galvantula's Bug Buzz, and gets an additional boost on Stages 3 and 5. If used at Stage 1 or 3, Growth will get powered up, so watch out for that. Grass moves get increasingly powerful as the stage increases, and Bug moves have boosts specifically on Stages 2 and 4. The five Synthetic Seeds also boost Special Defense and grant Ingrain, which is four times as powerful on Stage 4 specifically. Oh, and in Stages 4 and 5, Chlorophyll will always be on, meaning half of their Pokemon will consistently outspeed and destroy your team with their field-boosted moves.

One thing to consider is just using the field yourself. If you can spare a party slot or two, you can bring a few Pokemon optimized for Stage 5 Flower Field and go off. Bennett and Laura only take advantage of maybe half of the boosts this field provides, so you can try using the other half. For example, Sweet Scent at Stage 5 lowers Evasion, Def, and SpD by 3 stages each, so using this move with something fast can set up your other Pokemon for easy knockouts. Flower Shield and Flower Veil grant massive defense boosts to your Pokemon and Grass type allies, meaning you can just out-tank your Grass type opponents by targeting the Bug types first. Infestation does a massive 1/3 HP each turn, so if you can get this move out and wait out a few turns, you can easily clean up that way. Nature Power is Growth up until Stage 5, when it becomes Petal Blizzard, meaning this move will allow your Pokemon to set up and sweep all in one! You can also use your own offensive Bug moves - fighting Swarm users with Swarm users may be smart, or you can carefully keep the field at Stage 4 in order to benefit from those boosts.

Or, you can try to fight the Flower Field directly. Cut gets a 1.5x boost and deals an additional 2x damage to Grass types, meaning it can effectively hit with 150 Power against the Grass types. It and X-Scissor cut down the stage by one, meaning once all the seeds are exhausted, you may be able to keep the Stage relatively low by spamming these. Using the Poisonium-Z to fire off a Acid Downpour will instantly take the field back to Stage 1. With good timing, this will allow you to halt their momentum and hopefully get some of your own going.

Perhaps you could just change the field altogether: Sun will turn the field into the Rainbow Field for a little while, so you can try to devise a strategy involving that field if you want. What's better though is Burning Field. The Rain will stop you from turning the field to Burning Field, as would Sand. It's a bit tricky to set up, but Hail (we have the TM) followed up by a burning move like Lava Plume or Inferno Overdrive (we have the Z-Crystal) will succeed at this task! You can probably guess how well your opponents team will do on the Burning Field.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett you know what Apolysis is (+1 Bennett)

You'll get the *Sapphire Bracelets* for winning. Proceed to the next room, and ride the tile elevators upward.

!battle(["Elias", :ELIAS, 0], "Holy Field")

We finally get to fight Arceus' favorite holy man. He uses Normal and Dragon types on the Holy Field. Notably, Normal moves become super effective against Ghost and Dark types, and special Normal moves like Noivern's Boomburst get a power boost. Dragon and Psychic moves also get boosts, making Noivern, Kommo-o, Dragonite, and Drampa even more powerful. On the Physical side, Dragonite's Extremespeed and Mega Kangaskhan's Return also get boosted on this field. With Mega Kangaskhan's double Power-Up-Punch, Noivern's SpA boosting seed, and Kommo-o's omniboosting Z-Move, there are a lot of threats that can set up on you, making the aforementioned moves even more powerful. Oh, and he has a Choice Scarf Imposter Ditto that loves to swap in as soon as any of your sweepers set up to outspeed and kill.

There are no built in field switches for this one, but it does leave you a few great options. Notably, special Fairy type moves and your own Dragon type moves are boosted here, so if you're able to get them off, you can potentially sweep Noivern, Drampa, Kommo-O, and Dragonite after hazards. You can also abuse Nature Power Judgement, Return, and Extremespeed for massive power boosts. Rock and Steel types can switch in on Banded Dragonite doing a power trip with Extremespeed, giving them a chance to turn momentum in your favor. Just have a plan for Scarf Impostor Ditto!

Take the *Emerald Brooch* and proceed to the next room.

!battle(["Anna", :ANNA, 0], "Starlight Arena")

The last Elite Four member is a child who will destroy your team with her Psychic and Fairy types on top of the Starlight Arena. Psychic and Fairy moves are boosted here, and Dark moves get a Fairy subtyping, taking away one of Metagross' weaknesses. There are further boosts for Ninetales' Aurora Beam, Gardevoir's Signal Beam, Starmie's Flash Cannon, Gardevoir and Ninetales' Moonblast, Sylveon's Swift, and a massive boost for Mega Metagross' Meteor Mash that shreds almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Starmie with its seed and ability gets +3 SpA upon switch in, which paired with its high speed and coverage moves, means danger. Defensively, Cosmic Power and Wish are boosted, so Sylveon and Jirachi can potentially tank you. Ninetales' Aurora Veil is also always enabled.

If you want to win this one, as usual I think you can get away with taking advantage of the field yourself. Your own Meteor Mash, Mirror Shot, and Moonblast can all be potentially viable here. Wish and Moonlight heal more than usual, and Cosmic Power works for you too, so you can take advantage of the lack of priority aside from Bullet Punch to set up a tank of your own. Any weather condition will turn off the type boosts and the Fairy subtyping for Dark moves, so if you want to neuter her offensive power to some extent you can change the weather. We can't destroy the field or change it naturally, so make use of your teams synergy and the field effect to win this one.

You'll get the *Amethyst Pendant*. Proceed to the Champion room when you're ready.

You knew this was coming:

**If you didn't give Blake the Ruby Ring:**

!battle(["Lin", :LIN, 0])

**If you gave Blake the Ruby Ring:**

!battle(["Lin", :LIN, 1])

So, a Champion fight. If you look carefully, you'll notice that this team is almost entirely comprised of Pokemon stolen from Lin's victims... Ninetales from Ame, Gossip Gardevoir, Garchomp from Solaris, Conkeldurr/Togekiss from Samson/Ciel, and Delphox from Ace... So that's something. No field this time, so compared to the previous four fights this one generally won't be as bad. There is PULSE Abra in the back, this time not using Hyper Beam every turn, so you have to find a way to live its high powered special moves and hit back hard after defeating the other five Pokemon. You can take out the champion, I believe in you!

Once you regain control, head up and through the path. You'll need to use the Emerald Brooch on the first floor and solve a quick logic puzzle.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Or so it would seem. All four are Dark.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the puzzle solution</a>
</div>

In the Sapphire Bracelet room ahead is... another puzzle? Just choose an answer for each one. Proceeding from here, you can get the *PULSE Readout 11*. Oh boy.

Make your way to the top of the Arc and talk to Lin. Prepare your team and head in... Reborn's REAL champion fight is ahead.

Across this guide I've mentioned various choices that you can make to reach an exclusive postgame route - known by the community as the Anna Route. If you do not complete any one of the requirements for the Anna route, you will instead be on the Lin Route for the postgame. However, I actually think the first time player will get MORE out of the Lin Route than the Anna Route as far as the story goes, so don't feel like you're left out if you have missed one of the requirements. The Lin Route is still great and you should consider doing it first, going back for the Anna Route in a second playthrough. There is still one 'choice' left to make, so you can still opt out of the Anna Route if you'd like.

A summary of the Anna Route requirements till now:

1. Find all the police officers before fighting Ace in the Jungle
2. Defeat Solaris atop Pyrous Mountain
3. Refuse to fight Sigmund at Yureyu
4. Stop the doctor at Belrose
5. Side with Radomus at Citae Astrae, then defeat El
6. Don't give Blake the Ruby Ring
7. Refuse to fight Taka at the WTC
8. Allow Taka to join you in the desert

**Lin Route Fight:**

!battle(["Lin", :LIN, 2], "New World")

**Anna Route Fight:**

!battle(["Lin", :LIN, 3], "New World")

If you thought Lin's earlier fight was a bit too easy... well... there's this... a fitting end to the main game of Pokemon Reborn... and it's just brutal.

Let me first pause to make fun of some of you. Did you create your team largely around utilizing a specific weather condition? Or, are you even more crafty and use Pledge moves to create your own field, or perhaps the Lycanium-Z to destroy fields you don't like? Do you like the move Earthquake? Well, surprise, none of those things work here. Weather effects and generated fields simply do not work, so you'll always be fighting on New World without weather. And to lose against this fight means you'll have to go all the way back through the previous five. Your team is complete trash without your weather or field? Sucks for you! Remake it and battle your way all the way back. By the way, when I said "some of you", I meant me in the past, marching on in with a Rain Mono-Water team. Pelipper literally died in one shot to every single one of Lin's Pokemon no matter what I did. Sad. But I did eventually win!

So, onto the fight itself. Power Gem, Earth Power, Draco Meteor, Dazzling Gleam, Flash Cannon, and Dark type moves are all boosted here. All of her Pokemon have at least one of these. The New World Field also has this thing where grounded Pokemon have three-quarters speed and levitating Pokemon have slightly lowered Defenses. Lin having 4/5 non-grounded Pokemon essentially means unless you have a lot of them too, you're going to basically be losing speed battles you'd otherwise win. The defense drop is cancelled out on her Pokemon by virtue of the PULSE2 adding defenses to the sweepers anyways.

As for the team itself, it's real good. Mismagius is a cruel lead, taking advantage of the field boosts and speed nerf to hit fast and hard. Honchkrow is there to ruin your sweeper's day, getting off Sucker Punch to probably knock you out and snowball into a sweep. Clefable does usual Clefable things: saying NOPE to your boosts, getting double Cosmic Power boosts, and laughing in your crying face. Flygon (on Anna Route) and Hydreigon like to mercilessly overwhelm your Pokemon with their wide coverage. She also has the first enemy Ultra Beast... ugh. This thing is super tanky, has a STAB boosted move in Flash Cannon and good coverage in Flamethrower and Giga Drain, and also carries Leech Seed just in case you thought you were smart about using a tanky Pokemon of some kind. And the most cursed ability ever: Beast Boost, which will raise its SpA in this case.

You'll notice that I haven't mentioned the puppy in the room. It seems like the route that so far is harder to get into has an easier time with this fight, and that's true... sorta. While Anna Route gets PULSE Arceus replaced by Flygon, winning the first, easier fight will actually send you right into another fight. No healing or switching your team around in between.

!battle(["Lin", :CHILDLIN, 0], "New World")

So, yeah. With a 975 Base Stat Total, Perfect IVs, and a PULSE 2, no matter your route, you get to fight this thing, and if you're fighting it separately, you don't get to carry any momentum like stat boosts or hazards over from fighting the other six Pokemon. For that reason, doing the two-fight gauntlet version is strictly harder than the one-fight version, so I will give some advice for doing the gauntlet version.

It's worth noting that this is actually the 9th and final Anna Route requirement:

**Once you win the first fight, if you lose the second fight, you will be kicked out of Anna Route.**

You'll also have to fight the first New World Lin fight again, this time, it will be the version without Flygon and with Arceus. (If you still want to go to Anna Route, you can restore a backup if you want - there's actually one automatically created for you in the saves folder.)

Anyways, onto the strategy. Really, these fights come down to choreographing every single move pretty much. If you don't know whether Honchkrow is going to Sucker Punch or use its Z-move, you will probably lose. If a random attack of yours misses, it will likely throw off the whole fight and you will lose. Lots and lots of trial and error will probably be key here. I recommend setting your Z-move to Steel, Poison, or Rock in most cases. Clefable is usually the most annoying Pokemon to take out aside from Arceus, so having either a super-effective nuke or a field-boosted Continental Crush to take it out is usually a good idea. You may instead want to use it on Celesteela, in which case Fire, Electric, or field-boosted Dark are good bets. Even though all the other stuff like field changes and weather are out, ol' reliable TRICK ROOM is here to save the day - it even gets an automatic 8 turns on this field, freeing up your Trick Room user to hold something else like Light Clay. A Z-move of one of the aforementioned types or Mold Breaker on a slow set-up sweeper under Trick Room can barrel through the bulk of the team, freeing you up to worry about Arceus!

One more fun tech is that the Magical Seed grants an omniboost while causing you to recharge. If you hard switch, the Pokemon that comes out gets the recharge turn cancelled out as part of the switching turn, so that's nice. If you have a Pokemon with Recycle, it will cause the seed to be regenerated and consumed, but the recharge turn will again be done on that turn... meaning you can literally omniboost all the way to +6 if you have some way to not die in the meantime. A fun thing to turn to if all else seems lost.

Then there's Arceus. In the easier version, it is holding a Life Orb, so poisoning it then hiding behind Substitutes can be a funny way to watch it knock itself out. Unfortunately the harder version has a Z-Crystal and you don't get the time to set up anything on it, so you're going to have to use whatever scraps of your team remain after the previous fight to do... some cheap crap, pretty much. My first time it was just double Protect on Speed Boost Sharpedo followed by Destiny Bond. This time it was Accelerock for some chip plus a Sturdy Metal Burst. Some people will call strategies like these cheap, but what else can you really do against a Pokemon with 975 BST, full EV's, and IV's, and field boosts too? Do what you must and win both fights if you want to stay on Anna Route, or defeat just the one-team version to proceed to Lin Route.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat the 2-fight Lin Gauntlet and advance to Anna Route (-2 Terra)

Either way, once you complete this fight, you're like, done? You've completed the main game of Pokemon Reborn! Congratulations! I am proud of you! And thanks for reading so far :)

Head to any PC if you want to look at your Hall of Fame progress!
