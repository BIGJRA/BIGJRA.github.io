# Episode 8: Of Fathers Forgotten

Make your way all the way back out of the Wasteland. You'll find Cain near the exit. Prepare for a fight.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- If Cain ran away from home earlier, say you know what he means (+1 Cain)

!battle(["Cain", :Cain, 3], "Wasteland Field")

Another fight with Cain, this time on a field that benefits his team to some extent. Most of his Pokemon aren't very fast, so a fast sweeper or two can probably clean house. Just watch out for Muk who hits like a truck and also has Minimize for extra shenanigans.

Return to South Obsidia Ward.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you believe Cal (+1 Cal)
- Say you don't believe Cal (-1 Cal)

Cal will give you *TMX4 Strength*!

## Strength Exploration

Having Strength means there is a lot of exploration that we can now do. First of all, put Chingling into your party with the Soothe Bell attached. We'll need it evolved for a quest soon, so might as well take advantage of all the walking we are about to do.

First, note that the candy store has new inventory now.

!shop("Sweet Kiss (Bottom) (5-6 Badges)", ["Common Candy", ["Exp. Candy XS", 500], ["Exp. Candy S", 2000], ["Exp. Candy M", 5000], ["Exp. Candy L", 10000], "Rare Candy"])

Back in Opal Ward, there are new trainers on the bridge.

!battle(["Owen", :StreetRat, 0])

!battle(["Mikey", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

!battle(["Lulu", :BEAUTY, 0])

Next, make your way all the way up to Citrine Mountain 2F via Beryl Bridge.

!img("citrine2f2.png")

Go down and right (1). You'll see a strength boulder. Push it from the top so it goes down. Then, make your way around to the left (2) and step across the ice path that is now open. You will find a hidden *Shoal Salt* and *Red Shard* as well as *TM94 Secret Power*. Exit the mountain.

Make your way west to the Beryl Cemetery. Victoria is down from here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria in the cemetery (+2 Victoria)

Next, we're gonna return to Byxbysion Wasteland. Make your way to the right, going down the slide as before. After exiting the tall building, head up over the ledge and enter the cave at the top. Push the boulder into the hole and follow it, then go into the now accessible cave. Prepare for a fight and talk to the grave.

!battle(["Kiki", :Spectral, 0], "Wasteland Field")

Another tough fight with a single Pokemon, but you have some cheese strategies in your back pocket if need be.

Win and you'll obtain **Misdreavus**.

Back outside in the wasteland, make your way to the tunnels area and enter the room with two canisters. Head through the secret path to the left. When you get outside, go down the slide and enter the next room. Take the ladder up then immediately back down. Now we can move this boulder aside! Jump down the hidden ledge and move the next boulder to the left, then go up.

Here, you can find an *Exp. Candy L*, *TM12 Taunt*, and hidden *Ability Capsule* and *Nugget*. On rainy days you can also find a **Squirtle** chilling in the fountain, which we can catch. This is the first of the starters we can obtain aside from the starter table at the beginning of the game.

Return to the wasteland proper, and enter the tall building with stairs on the left side of the map. Show the Squirtle we caught to the guy inside for a *Data Chip*.

Next, take the boat to Apophyll. Head inside Pyrous Mountain and make your way up to 3F. Carefully maneuver the boulder into the hole here and follow it down. You'll find Tepig here, but talk to it and it will flee. Next, make your way to B1F and go to the right. Move the boulder and talk to Tepig again. Grab *TM37 Sandstorm* while you're here. Finally, make your way to the peak. Talk to **Tepig** and you'll be able to catch it!

Exit and take the boat to Azurine Island. At night, if your Chingling has enough friendship, it will evolve into **Chimecho**. Take Chimecho into the building where we battled Taka and show it to a guy here to obtain **Chikorita**.

## Yureyu Building

With that out of the way, head into the Underground Railnet and use Strength to reach the top. Grab the now-accessible hidden *Red Shard* and enter the door with the Y. This room has a hidden *Great Ball* and *Dragon Gem*. Upstairs is a hidden *Exp. Candy M* and outside you can find a hidden *Link Stone* and *Exp. Candy L*. Head into the Yureyu building.

You'll be partnered with Cain.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk with Cain while you're in Yureyu (+1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Try to leave Yureyu while partnered with Cain (-1 Cain)

!partner(["Cain", :Cain, 4])

It's a very straightforward area: defeat all the Meteor grunts as you make your way up.

!dbattle(["Hilda", :MeteorGrunt_090, 2], ["Ricardo", :MeteorGrunt, 2], "Short-Circuit Field")

!dbattle(["Kenneth", :MeteorGrunt, 1], ["Brenna", :MeteorGrunt_090, 1], "Short-Circuit Field")

!dbattle(["Simon", :MeteorGrunt, 2], ["Tara", :MeteorGrunt_090, 2], "Short-Circuit Field")

!dbattle(["Mary", :MeteorGrunt_090, 2], ["Coleman", :MeteorGrunt, 2], "Short-Circuit Field")

!dbattle(["Ringo", :MeteorKnight, 0], ["Rod", :MeteorKnight, 0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Once we reach the floor that Sigmund is on, we'll have a story choice to make.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to refuse fighting Sigmund at Yureyu.**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say Yes to Sigmund asking if you'll fight him (+1 Heather, -1 Sigmund)
- Say No to Sigmund asking if you'll fight him (+1 Sigmund, -1 Heather, -1 Cain)

### Fought Sigmund at Yureyu Route

If you said no to Sigmund, [jump to the next section](#didnt-fight-sigmund-at-yureyu-route)

!battle(["Sigmund Connal", :DOCTOR, 0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Thanks to the assistance of Cain, this one shouldn't be too bad. Musharna will use Psychic Terrain like last time, and his Electric and Psychic core will try to wear you down. The Short-Circuit Field will boost the former and the Psychic Terrain the latter, so make sure you neutralize the most threatening of your two opponents is each turn and you'll probably win.

### Didn't Fight Sigmund at Yureyu Route

If you said yes to Sigmund, [jump to the next section](#underground-railnet-east)

!battle(["Sirius", :Sirius, 0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Thanks to the assistance of Cain, this one shouldn't be too tough. You'll have to be careful of Minior setting up. Otherwise his Pokemon are generally fast and strong but frail, so if you have good type advantages and basic doubles strategies you can certainly do it.

## Underground Railnet East

Back on the ground floor, head east to enter another part of the railnet.

!img("railnet_east.png")

This room is pretty huge - scattered around you can find a hidden *Awakening*, *Revive*, *Super Potion*, *Resist Wing*, *Red-Hots*, *Swift Wing*, *Purple Shard*, *Protein*, *Cheri Berry*, 3 *Blue Shards*, 2 *PokéSnaxs*, and *Super Repel*. These items are roughly nearby the yellow marks on the map.

You can also find a bunch more of those shallow walls that you can use Rock Smash on - indicated by green arrows above. Behind these are *House Key*, *Iron Ball*, *Corrupted Poké Ball*, and *TM44 Rest*. You can also open the gate to the left (circled in blue) to create a shortcut to the Aron room.

Talk to Shelly on the right side of the area, then enter the train at the bottom of the map. Back outside, you'll need to use levers to connect this train to the exit area on the right. Essentially you can just follow the tracks until you hit a roadblock, then backtrack and click the lever and follow the new path until you are all done.

If you get stuck, set up the tracks such that the train would follow the orange arrow in the above image.

Talk to Noel when you have the correct layout. Re-enter the train. Talk to Shelly if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Shelly she was helpful (+1 Shelly)
- Tell Shelly she was not helpful (-1 Shelly)

Talk to Charlotte. CHOO CHOO!

## Tanzan Cove

We will emerge in a new area. Here, you'll find a *Purple Shard*, *Full Heal*, *Normal Gem*, and *Elemental Seed*. If it's raining, a guy on this map will tell us about the password *stablweather*. You can actually choose whether to go to the Belrose Manse via Tanzan Mountain first, or to go to Spinel Town via the forest first. Here, we will go to Belrose first, but you can skip this section and come back to it after Spinel if you'd like.

!enc(231)

On the left as you walk in, you'll see whichever of **Solrock** and **Lunatone** that you didn't get to catch earlier.

On this map, you'll find hidden *X Speed*, *PokéSnax*, *Hyper Potion*, 2 *Blue Shards*, *Revive*, *Ground Gem*, *Steel Gem*, *Escape Rope*, *Ultra Ball*, *Purple Shard*, and a visible *Exp. Candy XL*.

Talk to Charlotte then emerge at the top into Tanzan Cove.

!enc(232, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

In this area you can find a hidden *Escape Rope*, *Green Shard*, *Guard Spec.*, *Blue Shard*, *Peppermint*, *PokéSnax*, *Heart Scale*, *Rose Incense*, and *Elemental Seed*.

Enter the house at the top.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Enter Belrose Manse before going to Voclain Estate (+1 Noel, +1 Laura)

To the left you can see something glowing in a bookshelf. Interact with it to get the *Family Picture* for a sidequest way down the road. Anyways, talk to everyone in the house then head out.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly in Belrose Manse (+1 Shelly)

## Chrysolia Forest

Make your way back through Tanzan Mountain and exit at the bottom. Enter the forest on the bottom right side of this map.

!enc(234)

Make your way forward and follow the path up and around to the left.

!battle(["Elizabeth", :RANGERF, 0], "Forest Field")

You'll see a cave entrance hidden behind a tree - walk up to this tree and it will teleport away.

**Chrysolia Spring 1F**

!enc(238, ["Cave", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

More importantly, you'll find a *Mystic Water* and hidden *Link Stone* inside.

Back outside, head to the left and down, and attempt to exit the forest. A nearby tree will disappear, so follow the newly created path downwards. By now you've noticed that stuff is teleporting in and out. While this is confusing, the good news is that the path is mostly linear from here.

!battle(["Christian", :Casanova, 0], "Forest Field")

Go up, right, and down. You'll notice a single tree blocking off an open path below; approaching the tree will make it disappear. Follow this new path to find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Exp. Candy L*, and *Heart Scale*. To the right, you can talk to someone for the *Grassy Terrain Field Readout* and pick up a *Mild Mint* and a *Hasty Mint*. Enter the train to the left, and pick up the egg. It'll be **Cacnea** or **Maractus**, randomly determined.

Head back up and go left, continuing our linear travel through the teleporting tree forest. You'll go up towards the entrance, then go right.

!battle(["Ceratisa", :BEAUTY, 0], "Forest Field")

In the bottom right part of the forest you'll see a lone tree guarding an open path - you know what to do. Follow this path to reach a cave.

!enc(251)

Inside the railcave, there are two secret paths to goodies. First, you'll notice that each room has train tracks that point to three out of the four directions: start by entering the entrance that is not being pointed to by the tracks. Repeat this process over and over until you reach a room containing an *Ill-Fated Doll* and **Eevee**! You can read the Captain's Log here as well.

Back in the main area of the railcave, you'll notice that each room contains three rocks. In each room two of these rocks are close to one of the four directions - enter this direction. Repeat this process over and over until you reach a room containing a hidden *Ability Capsule*, the *Psychic Terrain Field Readout*, and *TM32 Double Team*.

Back in the forest, continue your circles by going left instead of up. Once you reach the upper right side of the area you'll see a path leading to the right.

!battle(["Aurelia", :LADY, 0], "Forest Field")

Here you'll find a hidden *Ability Capsule*. Head into the clearing here.

!enc(465, nil, nil, "Chrysolia Forest (Clearing)")

You'll find a hidden *Elemental Seed* as well as the *Burning Field Readout*, a *Quiet Mint* and an *Exp. Candy L*. This is also the Mossy Rock where you can get Leafeon.

Continue your circles by going up and left. You'll finally be able to enter Spinel Town at the clearing in the top right side!

## Spinel Town

You'll notice that everything is chaos here, teleporting like crazy. Enter an apartment building on the left side and a girl's furniture will all disappear. She'll ask us to get it back, so head out of her house.

Down from here, there's a tree in front of a house. The tree will move when you approach it. Inside, you can return the Kadabra girl's bed, and pick up the *Good Rod*! Outside, the fountain will disappear as you approach. Heading towards the center of town, you'll see the Kadabra girl's TV on top of a building. Trying to enter the Pokemart will cause it to teleport as well. To the right, you'll see Kadabra girl's bookshelf.

Enter the left tall apartment building. Inside, you'll find Kadabra girl's table. In the building to the right, a person inside will offer to trade your Shelmet and Karrablast for their respective evolutions. You will also be asked to pet every Eeveelution: new long sidequest!

Talk to a lady sitting on the bench, and she will completely disappear. Ok then. Go down and to the right: a house here will also disappear. Beyond it you will find Kadabra girl's first chair. Her second chair is up and to the right of the Pokemon Center. Speaking of, a guy inside the center will tell us a password: *hardcap*.

Enter the museum. Unfortunately every time we enter here it will cost $500. You can explore the museum to learn a bunch of lore. Upstairs is a person who will revive our fossils! So, that means depending on what you've found mining it is now possible to get **Omanyte**, **Kabuto**, **Lileep**, **Anorith**, **Cranidos**, and **Shieldon**. Unfortunately to finish the revival you have to leave the museum and pay the fee again! I will note that if you only have a single Helix Fossil, there is a quest later on that requires us to have one, so consider saving it for now if you aren't dying to have an Omanyte right now.

Anyways, head down and out of the door upstairs here and into the door on the other side to pick up the *Eevium-Z*. We can't use Mega Stones or Z-Crystals yet. Kadabra girl's nightstand is also in here, as well as a standard Ice Cream vending machine that contains a **Vanillite** like in the Sweet Co.

In the downstairs area of the museum at night, you'll see two Meteor grunts. Talk to them and they will flee to Tanzan Mountain. We will get to them in a bit. Oh, and there's a *Luxury Ball* in the trash to the right.

Outside, attempt to enter the Voclain Estate in the top right corner. Before you talk to Serra, talk to Bennett if you want points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett you knew Cascoon had perfect memories (+1 Bennett)

I hope they remember me killing 15 of them with Fire type moves in Pokemon Legends Arceus.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Bennett a second time (+1 Bennett)

In the upstairs rooms, you can find *Silk Scarf*, the *Mirror Arena Field Readout*, *TM85 Dream Eater*, *Bug Memory*, and *Weakness Policy*. You'll also find Kadabra girl's last bookshelf in Bennett's room.

With that, we should now have all of the furniture back, so return to the girl to get the *Exp. All*. An excellent item that levels your whole team and prevents leveling over the cap.

## Good Rod Encounters and Other Things

We could now go for the next badge, though there are many new Pokemon and items we can now get after visiting Spinel Town.

Grab your Male Burmy from the PC and level it to 20 so it evolves into **Mothim**.

Return to Chrysolia Forest - you'll have to basically do the circles in reverse to exit the forest. On your way you'll find the house that teleported earlier. A guy inside will do an in-game trade: your Mothim for his **Bruxish**.

Down from here, you'll find the teleported fountain. **Remoraid** will jump out for you to battle.

Return to Tanzan Mountain. Inside, you'll find the grunts from earlier.

!dbattle(["Devin", :MeteorGrunt, 2], ["Sanchez", :MeteorGrunt, 2], "Cave Field")

Defeat them here - we will return to the museum later to claim our reward. 

Now that we have a new rod there are a lot of encounters we can now get.

!enc(238, ["Fishing"], ["Good"])

!enc(232, ["Fishing"], ["Good"])

Make sure you catch a Luvdisc for an in-game trade we'll get to in a bit.

Once you return to Reborn City via the railnet, we can now snag the other gang mascot than ours. If you joined Magma Gang, head over to Lapis Alleyway.

!enc(170, ["Fishing"], ["Good"])

If you joined Aqua Gang, head over to North Obsidia Alleyway, where you will be able to find **Houndour** inside.

Anyways, some more encounters await: whether you go fishing from the Peridot side, Coral Side, Azurine Island, or Apophyll Beach side:

!enc(97, ["Fishing"], ["Good"], "Azurine Lake")

!enc(46, nil, ["Good"], "Lower Peridot Pool")

!enc(153, ["Fishing"], ["Good"])

The other major thing we can do now in Reborn City is to head on over to Onyx Ward and return the House Key to the girl on the west side to get a *Heart Scale*. She is the Move Relearner and will trade us relearned moves for Heart Scales... which we have in spades thanks to mining. Juice up your movesets if you'd like.

Take the Coral Ward boat to Apophyll. Grab Luvdisc from the PC, then head along the outer right wall of the academy to find someone who'll do an in-game trade: your Luvdisc for their **Darumaka**.

Finally, head all the way back through the railnet and the forest to Spinel Town. Talk to the museum curator to get your choice of *Plume Fossil* or *Armor Fossil*, which you can revive for **Archen** or **Tirtouga** respectively.

## Rime Badge

Return to Voclain Estate. Enter the room towards the back to reach the gym. In each room, you'll have to look for something that's wrong on one of the two sides. It could be a misplaced or miscolored item or something thematically tied to the gym. Anyways, once you find this discrepancy, smash the wall immediately above. If you're wrong, your party will take some damage, but you can always heal.

For each of the three puzzle rooms (so, a max of +3), you can get the following:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Smash the correct mirror on the first try (+1 Serra)
- Smash 2-5 incorrect mirrors before finding the answer (-1 Serra)
- Smash 6-7 incorrect mirrors before finding the answer (-2 Serra)

!battle(["Lydia", :BEAUTY, 0], "Mirror Arena")

!battle(["Lallia", :BEAUTY, 0], "Mirror Arena")

!battle(["Lania", :BEAUTY, 0], "Mirror Arena")

!battle(["Layla", :BEAUTY, 0], "Mirror Arena")

Save before you enter the third room.

!battle(["Bennett", :BENNETT, 0], "Mirror Arena")

It's time for our first battle with Bennett. Despite mainly using the crappy early game bugs, he has a highly optimized team for the Mirror Arena. All of the accuracy and evasion items and abilities raise his team's chance to get critical hits. With field boosted moves like Signal Beam, his Pokemon hit hard and fast. Five of six have Quiver Dance, so they'll probably try to set up on you. That said, his Bugs are all pretty frail and have lots of weaknesses - simply loading up on Rock moves will probably solve most of the problem. It's a good opportunity to try out your own Mirror Arena boosts - read the field notes.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Bennett on the first try (+1 Elias, -1 Bennett)
- Beat Bennett on the second, etc. try (+1 Bennett, -1 Elias)

Break the last mirror and head into the gym arena when you're ready.

!battle(["Serra", :SERRA, 0], "Mirror Arena")

Serra is a tough gym leader that operates on the back of her very unique field effect. Instead of thinking about how to beat a Hail-team like you normally would, you have to play around the fields various Accuracy and Evasion shenanigans. Her Bright Powder, Wide Lens, and Synthetic Seeds as well as Snow Cloak abilities all raise accuracy or evasion and boost critical-hit rate. For that reason you won't really be able to pull off a Special Defense boosting strategy nor use screens. In general, physical attackers will have a much harder time here since when they miss, they take damage. Special attackers, of which Serra has five, have a chance to hit anyways even when they miss - some of their attacks are even boosted in this case. Her Jynx, Froslass, and Sandslash under Hail are all incredibly fast as well. On the flip side, Glaceon, Alola-tales, and Lapras are a bit tankier. The latter two like to set up 8-turn Aurora Veil to further support their defensive strategy. All in all this is a tough fight that doubles down on the weaknesses of the Ice type and uses the Mirror Arena to great effect.

As you would assume just looking at the team, non-hail weather, and Brick Break / Psychic Fangs are generally good things to bring. Luckily, as stacked the Mirror Arena is for Serra, you can pretty easily use it to your benefit as well. There is a list of abilities that you can use to get Accuracy or Evasion, and we also have access to the Lax Incense and Zoom Lens at this point. All of these will allow you to get a boosted critical hit ratio - with priority, that means you can pick up some easy one shots on the glass cannons. The accuracy ones in particular will allow your physical attackers to overcome the misses + recoil damage and capitalize on the low Defense on Serra's Pokemon. Mirror Coat is a good option that you can use situationally to boost your defensive stats and knock out a threat like Lapras.

All of these things are nice, but it turns out there's something *even better* that you can use. Nature Power turns into Mirror Shot, which is boosted by two times and will always lower accuracy. That means any Special Attacker with access to Nature Power can use a 130 BP Steel type move that will never miss... against a team full of Ice types - only Lapras and Sandslash take neutral damage from it. On top of Chlorophyll, this allows even a team of all Grass types to effortlessly sweep the team of Ice types!

It's worth noting that there are a list of moves in the Field Notes that can destroy the Mirror Arena entirely. This can be another viable strategy to force Serra onto a more even playing field. However:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Break the Mirror Field in the gym fight (-1 Serra)

Once you win, you'll get the *Rime Badge* which boosts our cap to Lv. 55. You'll also get *TM70 Aurora Veil*.
