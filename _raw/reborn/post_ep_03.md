# Postgame Episode 3: The Umbral Issue

Back in the Nightclub, there are new quests we can pursue. The level cap has also been raised to Lv. 115.

## Route 3 New World

Talk to Sandy and accept her quest to check out Route 3.

Fly over to Calcenon, then go down the stairs and right onto the route. Head east and into the first cave, where you'll find a New World Door.

!enc(835, nil, nil, "New World (Route 3)")

Head up and talk to the Ringmaster. Once Virizion runs off, follow it left. You'll be attacked with gusts of wind, so it might be smart to turn off super speed. Once Virizion runs off again, the gusts will stop.

Head down and right when you're ready.

!partner(["Alistasia", :RINGMASTER, 0])

!dbattle(["One for All", :MUSKETEER1, 0], ["for One", :MUSKETEER2, 0], "New World")

Ringmaster Alistasia will be your ally, meaning you do have a numbers advantage in this one. If you can keep her Primarina alive and give it Trick Room support, it can fairly easily deal with Cobalion's trio. Focus on knocking these out first since alone the Silvally trio is not very threatening.

With the battle done, two of the three will run off to allow you to catch them. **Virizion** can be caught to the left in the grassy area. On the right side of the area, you'll find **Cobalion**.

Head outside of the New World. Make your way through the Route 3 Cave system towards the LCCC. In the Sapphire Cave you'll find **Terrakion** up some rocks.

But wait, there's more! Return to the New World Door in the Ruby Cave and talk to the Ringmaster at the top of the area. Head in to the next area.

!enc(839, nil, nil, "New World (Route 3 Back)")

Head up when you're ready for one heck of a battle.

!dbattle(["Keldeo", :KELDEO, 0], ["Swords of Justice", :MUSKETEER3, 0], "Ashen Beach")

We once had an optional Victoria battle on Ashen Beach, then the Kiki fight. One of the Victory Road spirits battled on it too, but this is the fourth significant battle in the whole game here. May take a bit of time to get used to it again!

Anyways, this is the hardest fight in the Postgame so far. 12 Pokemon that are all threats, inherently or because of the field, against you and an ally that loves to make terrible decisions sometimes (COME ON PRIMARINA TARGET KELDEO IT'S THE OBVIOUS THREAT). You have to have some kind of plan for the opener: Weavile uses Beat Up on Cobalion, granting it +5 attack by the turn's end. Not good. On top of that, all the field boosted mud attacks, Surf, and Focus Blast will deal heavy damage. I recommend first stopping Weavile, getting up Trick Room and doing everything in your power to defeat the right side first, then hoping you end up in a position where Alistasia's Hawlucha is alive, since it can OHKO all three of the Swords of Justice and Mega Lucario. Psychic moves are generally good here - boosted Calm Mind and Psychic with speed support may be one way to sweep. 

Afterwards, you'll be able to battle and catch **Keldeo**! Thankfully your team will be healed beforehand.

If you refused to give Blake the Ruby Ring, you'll have another fight now.

!battle(["Samson", :UMBSAMSON, 0], "Ashen Beach")

An interesting team for Samson, focusing this time on feminity in particular. Be careful of the numerous Focus Blasts, particularly on his Ultra Beast Pheromosa, which can easily set up on you. Lots of speed here so as usual I will suggest Trick Room.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- After refusing to give Blake the ring, defeat Umbral Samson (+1 Samson)

Accept Alistasia's offer to return to the Nightclub.

## Route 4 New World

Talk to Aster and accept his quest to head over to Route 4 via Calcenon City. 

### Purple Zone

Climb the rocks, then at the fork go up. Go left from here to find a New World Door.

!enc(836, nil, nil, "New World (Route 4)")

The lower floor looks like this:

!img("nw4_purple_lower.png")

And the upper floor looks like this:

!img("nw4_purple_upper.png")

Follow the path up, and down, taking ladders A, B, C, D. From above, you'll see light bridges shining from the level down below - keep track of where these are. Once you go down the fourth ladder (D), you'll need to hop across to the north, then follow the path. Use the first invisible bridge right, down, and left to continue.

You'll reach a fork here: go to the left, follow the ladders E, F, G up and down, then interact with the orb.

Backtrack to the fork, this time, going across the narrow path on the bottom right. Traverse two ladders H, I. Here, hug the right wall and follow the green path right to reach:

**ZCell 03: New World (Route 4)**

!img("zcell_03.jpg")

Continue following the path from here, hopping to the north and traversing ladders J, K. You'll reach what appears to be a dead end: there is an invisible bridge on the right side that will bring us back to a landmass with two ladders (B, C) we visited previously. Take the bottom ladder (B, then A) and follow the path to exit this section of the New World.

### Gray Zone

Back on Route 4, make your way past the first lake map, on route to the Glass Workstation, but go right on the next map instead, down the rocks. You'll see another New World Door, so head in.

!img("nw4_grey.png")

Follow the path, then climb the ladder L. It will take you up to see some light bridges below - note these, then head back down and follow the light bridge to the left. Continue following the light bridges in the bottom right side of the area. Climb the next ladder (M) to note some more light bridges near the entrance that we didn't see before.

Head all the way back to nearby the New World Door, and go left across the invisible bridge. Going up the next ladder (N) will give you more information about light bridges: follow the path across invisible bridge after invisible bridge from here, hopping across to other landmasses when necessary. Eventually you'll reach a ladder (O), where you can find another orb! You can now hop up from here and go left to reach a warp that will take you back to the New World Door.

### Blue Zone

Back on Route 4, make your way to the map containing the Glass Workstation. Surf on the lake, and take the waterfall at the bottom of the map. Enter the New World Door on this next map.

!img("nw4_blue.png")

This map is the simplest of the three: use the two ladders (P, Q) to discover light bridges below that you can use to reach the top right ladder (R). Talk to the third orb!

Head up, and cross the bridge to the right. You'll now notice hop platforms going up from here, so follow this path up when you're ready.

!battle(["Anomaly", :GENIES, 0], "New World")

Trick Room + Ice Move = Profit.

Once you defeat this team, the three will split up. Hopping across the rocks in all three directions, you can catch **Tornadus**, **Thundurus**, and **Landorus**.

Once you're done and try to head out of this area, if you gave Blake the Ruby Ring, you'll have a battle here.

!battle(["Ciel", :UMBCIEL, 0], "New World")

Ciel uses a team full of Flying types on New World Field, meaning they'll all have a speed advantage over grounded Pokemon but have weakened defenses. Celesteela will probably give you flashbacks to the Lin fight - it's as cruel as ever, this time with a Magical Seed to really amplify the Beast Boost shenanigans. With a Special Landorus Set, mega Pinsir with Priority, boosted Darkinium-Z Zapdos, and more... this is a tough team. I recommend abusing Power Gem / Rockinium-Z boosts, Magical Seeds of your own, and Trick Room for this one.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- After giving Blake the ring, defeat Umbral Ciel (+1 Ciel)

Head down from here, use the warp, and return to the Nightclub.

## Chrysolia Deepwoods

Talk to Nyu in the Nightclub and accept his quest.

Fly over to Spinel Town, then make your way to the train in the south side of the Chrysolia Forest. Enter the New World Door to the right.

!enc(838, nil, nil, "New World (Chrysolia Forest)")

The rest of the Ultra Beasts are wild-only in this game, so keep an eye out. Magnetic Lure makes getting one easier.

Follow the path and exit through the New World Door on the other side.

!enc(840)

On this map, you can find a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Great Ball*, *Max Repel*, *Zinc*, *Quick Ball*, *Exp. Candy XL*, *Red-Hots*, *Dusk Ball*, *Super Repel*, *Oran Berry*, *Iron*, *Red Shard*, and *Ultra Ball*. 

There are also some trainers on this map:

!battle(["Trevor", :AceTrainerM, 0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Tac", :PkMnRANGER_Male, 0], "Forest Field")

Once you've finished exploring the woods, head to the large structure in the center.

Follow the arrows to the statue to the right and press the button. Talk to Smeargle. He was kind enough to write instructions for us in this next area! How nice. Essentially, you'll need follow the numbered instructions one by one in this area. Note that once you complete the first 6 steps you can go to the far top right corner and grab the *Reveal Glass*.

Once you succeed at solving Smeargle's helpful instructions, enter the New World Door at the top. Hug the right wall as you proceed.

**ZCell 04: New World (Chrysolia Forest)**

!img("zcell_04.jpg")

Head up when you're ready.

!battle(["Regigigas", :REGIGIGAS, 0], "New World")

This one isn't too bad really, again it's a Trick Room Team that relies entirely upon it's lead, meaning if you can prevent Trick Room, cancel it out, or stall it out, you'll be just fine. Everything is weak to Fighting type moves, too!

Afterwards, you'll be challenged to a battle, where you can catch **Regigigas**. Head out once you're done...

## Umbral Battle at Vanhanen Castle

Your level cap is now Lv. 120, by the way.

Back in the Nightclub, talk to Seacrest, and accept the quest. Head over to Vanhanen Castle when you're ready... Oh boy.

!dbattle(["Radomus", :UMBRADOMUS, 0], ["Gardevoir", :ANOMGARDEVOIR, 0], "Chess Board")

12V6 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

So yeah this one is really hard. Two megas! Two entire teams that are specifically designed with basically the best candidates for every chess piece, including the best non-legendary Pokemon in the game in Aegislash! It's just... brutal. Even if you go for Stomping Tantrum or Tectonic Rage to destroy the board... you're still stuck fighting all of these guys. Trying Trick Room? Aegislash, Aggron, and Escavalier are slow, while Kartana and Lopunny are super fast.

Anyways, I think there are two strategies to consider. The first, while not that simple as mentioned earlier, is simply to smash the field and just overwhelm your opponents with a very well prepared doubles team. Setting up a sweeper or two with speed and good coverage can be difficult to pull off, but can make it work. A lot of the team relies on Physical moves this time, so if you can deal with Kartana's Brick Break, Reflect can be helpful here.

Alternatively, you can try to use the Chess Board to your own benefit. Having two pawns means you get free Focus Sashes to try to develop some momentum, though Cloyster's multi-hit moves do make this difficult. Setting up a good hard-hitting King via the King's Rock can be crucial, especially if they are on the slower side.

Either approach may yield you results but don't be afraid to try, try again, try again more times, cry, and try again. Eventually you'll probably succeed.

Accept the warp once you win back to the Nightclub. That's it for this section.
