# Episode 2: Reap What's Been Sewn

Head outside, and talk to Victoria outside the gym. She'll tell us our next destination is to the east of the Grand Hall.

Before we continue though, there are a couple quests we can complete before we proceed to the next area.

## 1 Badge Quests

Head nearby the train station in Lower Peridot. While it is raining, if you have a snax in your bag you can give it away to get **Numel**!

Nearby you'll find a hiker. Talk to him, then talk to the person in the house containing Whismur earlier on. Return to the hiker and follow him to the house to receive **Onix**!

Next, enter the Grand Hall. The Common Candy salesman near the shop is now gone, but in his place is a person with glasses who will give us the *Rainbow Field Readout*. Keep this field in mind for later.

Now that we have a badge, Pokemarts will be updated:

!shop("Default Mart (1 Badge)", ["Potion", "Antidote", "Paralyze Heal", "Burn Heal", "Escape Rope", "Repel", "Poké Ball"])

Having a couple repels never hurts, but money is still scarce and catching them all is an expensive task, so I still recommend focusing mostly on balls.

You'll also notice that there are more trainers on Opal Bridge. Again clockwise:

!battle(["Zane", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

!battle(["Elena", :Doxy, 0])

!battle(["Elio", :Casanova, 0])

## Obsidia Ward

When you're ready, talk to Victoria on the right side of Opal Bridge.

Head into the Central Salon. Inside, you'll find a friendship checker as well as a groomer who will raise your Pokemon's friendship for $1500. Do this once if you have the money.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Get at least one massage at the Central Salon (+1 Serra)

A lady on the right will ask to see a Pokemon with maximum friendship. Your starter is likely here by now if it's stayed in your party the whole game so far, you've done all the sidequests, and you haven't let it faint too much. If you do show her one, you'll get the *Soothe Bell*! Helpful if you want to accelerate the evolution of your Igglybuff, Woobat, etc.

The building to the right is Critical Capture, where you can buy custom balls.

!shop("Critical Capture (Right)", ["Heavy Ball", "Moon Ball", "Fast Ball", "Love Ball", "Nest Ball", "Net Ball", "Dive Ball", "Timer Ball", "Friend Ball"])

Most of these are really not too worth it right now compared to the regular variety (especially Friend Ball... yikes) but I recommend picking up a few Love Balls - their 4x catch rate can be activated fairly easily on-genderless Pokemon, helpful for Pokemon with lower catch rates we may encounter.

Outside, head right and up.

!battle(["Franklin", :StreetRat, 0])

Enter the Pokemon Center, and talk to both the girl on the left and the mother on the right to activate some quests.

Enter the building to the right, and talk to the daycare couple one-by-one over and over until they drop their facade and battle you.

!dbattle(["Grant", :MeteorGrunt, 1], ["Janis", :MeteorGrunt_090, 1])

Eventually, we will be freeing the real daycare couple! In a house to the left, we'll learn about an in-game trade we can't complete just yet. Head outside, and to the left, grab a hidden *Steel Gem* in the rock. Go down the stairs to access a new part of the railnet.

!enc(103, nil, nil, "Underground Railnet (Obsidia Side)")

Klink is pretty good on the Factory Field, which we'll be seeing a lot in this game. There is also an *Escape Rope* hidden in the leftmost rock.

Head back out and enter the Devon Corp building on the main street.

!shop("Devon Corporation", ["Potion", "Repel", "Poké Ball"])

Nothing special here for sale, but if you talk to the mysterious salesman, he'll give you a free *Premier Ball* the first time.

The next building in line is the Sweet Kiss Candy Shop building. In the top left corner, you can complete a puzzle to get **Swirlix**! The completed puzzle looks like this:

!img("swirlix.jpg")

At the top, a kid really wants some Vanilla Ice Cream. Since he's blocking the machine though we can't get any here - you'll have to wait until it's sunny and buy some from Opal Ward. Give it to this kid and then buy a Vanilla Ice Cream for $1000 from the vending machine - it will be a **Vanillite** in disguise! After this the vending machine will be normal again.

!shop("Sweet Kiss Vending", ["Vanilla Ice Cream", "Choc Ice Cream", "Berry Ice Cream"])

There is a 1% chance you will actually get a *Blue Moon Ice Cream* whenever you buy any one of these. Choc and Berry are more expensive here than in Opal Ward, so there's really no reason to buy these here ever.

!shop("Sweet Kiss (Top) (0-12 Badges)", ["Whipped Dream", "Peppermint", "Chewing Gum", "Pop Rocks", "Salt-Water Taffy", "Red-Hots", "Cotton Candy"])

If you're planning on evolving Swirlix, grab a Whipped Dream. We will eventually need another Whipped Dream for a quest. Cotton Candy functions as a Revive, but is very expensive. The rest are just expensive versions of the status healing items, but all raise friendship.

!shop("Sweet Kiss (Bottom) (0-1 Badges)", ["Common Candy", ["Exp. Candy XS", 500], "Rare Candy"])

Since grinding trainers give them every time you beat them, you don't need to spend your precious money on Exp. Candy or the expensive Rare Candies.

Back outside, follow Victoria to the right. If you'd like to get to battle Victoria and potentially get a point with her in a bit, talk to Florinia.

!img("hidden011.png")

- (A): *PokéSnax*
- (B): *PokéSnax*

Head left and down.

!battle(["Davinson", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

Grab the hidden *Potion* (C), then proceed into South Obsidia Ward.

Enter the building here and talk to the guy here. His Lillipup will run off - we will have to chase it. I will come back to this quest once we can access all the locations. For now, exit the building and follow the path down.

!battle(["Wayne", :StreetRat, 0])

!img("hidden012.png")

- (A): *Dire Hit*
- (B): *Blue Shard*
- (C): *Green Shard*

While it's windy, you can catch wild **Hoppip** here! Anyways, enter the slums.

## Obsidia Slums

Grab a *Potion* (A, below) in the trash can to the left and head up.

!battle(["Rafe", :StreetRat, 0])

!battle(["Omar", :StreetRat, 0])

!img("hidden013.png")

- (B): *Great Ball*
- (C): *PokéSnax*
- (D): *Red Shard*

!battle(["Ulf", :StreetRat, 0])

!battle(["Gregory", :StreetRat, 0])

To the left you'll find a Light Shard, which heals your party but disappears after.

If you talked to Victoria near the park earlier, head up and talk to Victoria for a battle. If you didn't or you want to skip her battle, talk to the fridge in the upper right corner to delete the barrier. Talk to the nearby trashcan to get a *PokéSnax*.

!battle(["Victoria", :Victoria, 1])

Her Torracat likes to try to set up on you, so be careful of that. Otherwise her team isn't anything too crazy - Ralts and Pichu are pretty weak and you can set up on them.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Victoria in the Slums (+1 Victoria)

After that's done, head down the escalator to the right. There are encounters in this area.

!enc(88)

A long time from now you can trade Pidove away for something much better, so catch one if you like.

!img("hidden014.png")

- (A): *Oran Berry*
- (B): *Great Ball*, not hidden
- (C): *Max Repel*

Sneak between the escalators to reach the latter and a *Carbos* in the next room. Head back up the escalator and go up to proceed.

!enc(90)

!battle(["Neville", :TechNerd, 0])

!battle(["Brody", :StreetRat, 0])

!img("hidden015.png")

- (A): *Pop Rocks*
- (B): *Rawst Berry*

Head upstairs.

!enc(91)

Head to the left, then go up the stairs once more. Talk to Corey here, then pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy S* in a jar below. Grab the *Zinc* at the top and head back downstairs and follow the path clockwise around the room, picking up items:

!img("hidden016.png")

- (A): *Moon Stone*. You need to be up against the bottom fence to hop across to reach this one.
- (B): *Exp. Candy XS*
- (C): *Potion*
- (D): *Ice Heal*

!battle(["Mason", :StreetRat, 0])

One of Ame's stated goals with Reborn was to ensure every Pokemon appeared in at least one enemy team. Here's to Cascoon!

Head left and emerge onto the roof. There's another Light Shard here - usually they mean either "you're halfway through a dungeon" or "there's a super hard fight coming up". Anyways, follow the path and talk to Mankey in the elevator. Take it to 1F to open a shortcut, then take it to B1F.

!shop("Obsidia Slums Vending", ["Fresh Water"])

Sometimes you even get two! Talk to the guy at the bottom of the area... turns out this is the guy who stole our $1000 Pokemon from the thieves in Peridot!

!battle(["Kai", :YOUNGSTER, 0])

But, alas, he sold it to someone else. This quest to be continued once more!

!img("hidden017.png")

- (A): *Normal Gem*
- (B): *Exp. Candy S*
- (C): *Red-Hots*
- (D): *Green Shard*
- (E): *Purple Shard*

Enter the gap on the left and pick up the *Friend Ball*. Head back out.

Talk to the box in front of the elevator to watch it scurry away. Enter the elevator and go to 1F. Grab the *Net Ball* and talk to the kid here to make him move, opening a shortcut. In the elevator again, go to 2F to grab *TM60 Quash*. Quash!!!!!

Back on B1F, enter the big door and head up.

!battle(["Dax", :StreetRat, 0])

!img("hidden018.png")

- (A): *Oran Berry*
- (B): *Poké Ball*

In the next room, it's time for a battle!

!battle(["Gang", :Pokemon, 0])

As long as you are able to bully Scrafty when it comes out you should be able to make this work with a team of six.

!img("hidden019.png")

- (A): *Potion*
- (B): *Blue Shard*

Proceed to the next room.

!img("hidden020.png")

- (A): *Potion*
- (B): *Exp. Candy S*

We're back in the large basement area for the third time. Lots of items to get here; follow the path down and to the right.

!img("hidden021.png")

- (A): *Cotton Candy*, between escalators
- (B): *Burn Heal*
- (C): *Antidote*
- (D): *Cheri Berry*
- (E): *Super Potion*, not hidden
- (F): *Exp. Candy S*

This is a dead end without Rock Smash. Backtrack your way to the escalators and go up. Talk to the backpacker below to get the grate opened for a shortcut.

Immediately up and to the right, you'll find a box containing an *Awakening*. Head to the right and jump your way through this path, pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* and an *Antidote* in rocks on the right side, and go down. Here you'll find an abandoned egg. When it hatches it will be **Bronzor**, **Ducklett**, or **Drowzee**, determined randomly.

Backtrack to the previous room and follow the path up. Talk to the Spoink hiding under some beams here to begin a quest, then emerge into daylight!

!img("hidden022.png")

Grab the hidden *Repel* (A) and enter Coral Ward at the bottom.

## Coral Ward

Welcome to Coral Ward.

!img("hidden023.png")

- (A): *Potion*
- (B): *Ultra Potion*
- (C): *Purple Shard*
- (D): *Chewing Gum*
- (E): *Repel*
- (F): *Aspear Berry*

!enc(109, nil, ["Old"])

Inside the apartment complex at the top, you'll meet Danielle who will give you a quiz. Feel free to go find the answers yourself if you'd like. Otherwise, here they are.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    4, 7, 31
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Coral Quiz Answers</a>
</div>

As a reward for completing the quiz you'll get the *Misty Terrain Readout*. Useful, since Coral Ward is covered in mist.

In a house below, there is an in-game trade. Raise your Patrat to Lv. 20 to get **Watchog**, then trade it for a **Nosepass**.

On the dock, if it is raining and you have Snax, you can obtain **Lotad**.

!battle(["Wade", :FISHERMAN, 0], "Misty Terrain")

Talk to the blue haired girl towards the top.

!battle(["Cain", :Cain, 1], "Misty Terrain")

This one isn't too crazy. Notice that Popplio's Icy Wind is boosted by the field, so watch out if you were planning on using anything weak to Ice. Nidorino hits somewhat hard but a Steel type can wall it.

After the battle, you'll be given *TMX1 Cut*!

## Obsidia Park

Return to South Obsidia Ward and use your new field move to chop down the tree. Thankfully in this game an HM, or "TMX", can be deleted from your Pokemon at will.

!battle(["Carter", :StreetRat, 0])

Talk to the kid here - we will reunite him with his mother as soon as we can. Enter the Glazamonia Salon here. Furfrou can later be groomed here, they also offer massages for $2000. A lady here will ask us to investigate the Central Salon for them - we will do so later.

Back in Obsidia Ward, head up from here. You'll be back in the area in front of the park - we can actually access one more side area before we proceed into the park. At the left end of the ward, down from the Cafe Salon, cut down the tree and go south.

!battle(["Vinny", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

Defeating this trainer gives us access to the Obsidia Alleyway.

!enc(105)

!battle(["Terrance", :YOUNGSTER, 0])

!battle(["Sally", :Punk, 0])

!battle(["Brittnay", :Punk, 0])

There is a hidden *Potion* in the top rock immediately upon entering the area, and a *Green Shard* in the box in the top right.

At the top of the area during the morning and day, you'll find a Litleo, who will run off.

At night, you'll see two Mightyena's bullying **Electrike**, who will join you if you can defeat them.

!battle(["Strays", :MIGHTYENA, 0])

To the left of the area, a **Minun** or a **Plusle** will pop out and join you if you give it snax. You can get both by exiting and re-entering.

If this is a bit too hard for now feel free to skip this one, but if you enter the Underground Railnet from the Obsidia entrance you'll find Litleo and have to fight a strong Pokemon.

!battle(["Mechanightmare", :KLINKLANG, 0], "Cave Field")

If you're able to defeat this thing, you'll get **Litleo**!

With all that out of the way, return to the park area and talk to Victoria, Amaria, and Florinia. Head into Obsidia Park. Note that once we are done here we can't re-enter, so if you want the hidden items and such grab them while we're here. All of the Pokemon will be available later, though.

!enc(269)

!img("hidden024.png")

You can start by grabbing a hidden *Oran Berry* (A) in the third bush to the left.

!battle(["Chad", :MeteorGrunt, 0], "Forest Field")

Pick up some more items:

- (B): *Poké Ball*, not hidden
- (C): *Chesto Berry*

Cut wiggly tree #1, then make your way back to the entrance.

!img("hidden025.png")

Cut wiggly tree #2 near the entrance, and follow the new path down and to the right. Pick up the *Leppa Berry* (D) then cut wiggly tree #3. From here, return to the entrance by going right, down, then back to the left.

!img("hidden026.png")

Up from here, cut down wiggly tree #4. This opens up a path to the left, so follow the path left from the entrance of the area. Grab a *Pecha Berry* (E) in a bush, then head right to cut wiggly tree #5 to open up a shortcut. Go right to cut wiggly tree #6.

Follow the path to the right from here.

!img("hidden027.png")

!battle(["Minta", :MeteorGrunt_090, 0], "Forest Field")

Straight down from here is a hidden *Super Potion* (F). Follow the path to watch a scene, cut wiggly tree #7, then take the paved road upwards. Grab the hidden *Green Shard* (G).

!dbattle(["Christopher", :MeteorGrunt, 0], ["Ama", :MeteorGrunt, 0], "Forest Field")

!img("hidden028.png")

Cut wiggly trees #8 and #9. Follow the blue line from here to reach a building: inside, you'll find *TM54 False Swipe* and the *Warehouse Key*. Back outside, follow a path straight to the left to obtain an *X Sp. Def*.

Back down from here, follow the yellow path to the left. In the second rock you'll find an *Antidote* (H). Use the Light Shard if you'd like, then prepare for a battle!

!battle(["ZEL", :ZEL, 0], "Forest Field")

This is our first battle with a PULSE! For this, and all custom Pokemon forms in this game, I provide a reference for base stats, typing, and other data [in the appendices](#custom-pokemon-form-lookup). The Field Notes app in game also has you covered, minus specific numbers.

As you can see from its stats, Tangrowth is pretty slow, which luckily means you can take the chance to cripple it with paralysis or stat debuffs. It doesn't hit ridiculously hard either, so your Pokemon will likely be able to live a few turns before being knocked out, but you do have to be cautious of field-boosted Grass moves. The difficulty lies in its combination of Acid Spray and Mega Drain, as it likes to weaken you then heal back to full. Making sure that you're dealing more damage than it is able to heal will be the key here.

Once you succeed, the vines will recede and we'll be back in the park.

!enc(36)

Catch a Sentret and add it to your team for an in-game trade in a bit if you'd like.

There are some hidden items in this area as well:

!img("hidden029.png")

- (A): *Heart Scale*
- (B): *Exp. Candy M*
- (C): *Super Potion*

To the left of the Super Potion is a trainer.

!battle(["Eilee", :COOLTRAINER_Female, 0])

Pick up the last few hidden items here:

- (D): *Cotton Candy*
- (E): *Red Shard*

The building on the left is Silph Co., but we can't do much here for now. The right building here is the Department Store. Time for Shopping!

**Department Store 1F Left Shop**

!shop("Department Store 1F (Left)", ["Poké Ball", "Escape Rope", "Common Candy", "Repel", "PokéSnax"])

!shop("Department Store 1F (Right)", ["Potion", "Antidote", "Awakening", "Burn Heal", "Paralyze Heal", "Ice Heal"])

We can also talk to an employee to get the *Membership Card* and the *Department Store Sticker: Porygon*. Each time we get a stamp, we can access another floor of the building. We'll be slowly getting these across our adventure.

!shop("Department Store 2F (Left)", ["Oran Berry", "Cheri Berry", "Pecha Berry", "Rawst Berry", "Chesto Berry", "Aspear Berry", "Persim Berry"])

!shop("Department Store 2F (Right)", ["Pomeg Berry", "Kelpsy Berry", "Qualot Berry", "Tamato Berry", "Hondew Berry", "Grepa Berry"])

Our Pokemon have been getting random EV's so far - if you in the future want to EV train your Pokemon, you can buy these to make the process easier. In Reborn, 20 EVs per berry are lowered instead of the canon 10. Don't worry about them for now - EV training will become a lot easier later on.

Make your way down and left to the Obsidia Pokemon Center and talk to the mom inside. Tell her where her son is to get an *Ability Capsule*!

If you're interested in a trade, evolve Sentret we got earlier by raising it to Lv. 15 to get **Furret**. In the house left from the Pokemon Center, you can trade it to get **Castform**!

Take another visit to the Central Salon and talk to the people inside. Then return to the Glamazonia Salon and talk to the lady, who'll let you take home **Glameow**. They'll also lower their massage price to $1400. That's not all for this quest though, no. Take your Glameow to the Central Salon and show it to the lady on the right; she'll allow us to battle her.

!battle(["Suzy", :BEAUTY, 0])

Obviously this is a pretty tough fight for this point in the game, feel free to return to it later. Maybe a fire type might be able to lower its stats or something since it resists both of its attack moves?

If you're able to win, you'll get **Bounsweet**!

That's pretty much all we can do in Obsidia for now, but before we continue the story we can take a brief detour back to Coral Ward for some goodies.

The warehouse key we got earlier works on three of the warehouses here. In the left one, you'll find the real daycare couple! By freeing them, the daycare will now be in service for all your Pokemon breeding needs.

The second warehouse contains a *Macho Brace* as well as **Spoink** randomly hiding in one of the boxes. The third warehouse contains a Meteor Grunt. Talking to him allows us to get a Pokemon later on. Also in here is a **Happiny**!

## Onyx Ward

Head up into Onyx Ward from the northeastern corner of Obsidia. Onyx Ward is pretty small, but there are some things we can do here before challenging the gym.

First, we'll do a counter-clockwise loop of the area. Trainers include:

!battle(["Baxter", :YOUNGSTER, 0])

!battle(["Joel", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

!battle(["Tammy", :COOLTRAINER_Female, 0])

!battle(["Ginelle", :Punk, 0])

!battle(["Jacee", :COOLTRAINER_Female, 0])

There are hidden items too:

!img("hidden030.png")

- (A): *Cheri Berry*
- (B): *Antidote*
- (C): *Carbos*
- (D): *PokéSnax*

The bottom left building is the Move Relearner house, but we can't enter it yet. Head in to the apartment to the right and talk to the girl on the left twice; for saving the Daycare couple, she'll give us an egg! It will be one of the following, determined randomly: **Clauncher**, **Seel**, **Remoraid**, **Spheal**, **Clamperl**, or **Frillish**. That's all here for now, so head next door to the game corner.

<div class="shop_section"><table>
<thead><tr><th colspan="2" class="table-header" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Onyx Arcade Loto Attendant</strong></th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><em>Reborn Ball</em></td>

</tbody></table></div>

We can play the lottery once a day, though without a Coin Case, there's not much else to do yet. 

Enter the trainer school at the top left entrance. Fern will lock us out, so head outside and defeat the trainer to enter the school at the top right entrance.

!battle(["Blane", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

This area is mostly linear with a few detours. Talk to every green bookshelf and stray green book that you find lying around - they'll give us lore as well as the answers to some questions we'll need to answer later on.

!dbattle(["Tristy", :COOLTRAINER_Female, 0], ["Jojo", :YOUNGSTER, 0])

!battle(["Noah", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

In the first door upstairs, a guy will give you the *Coin Case*!

!battle(["Landon", :EXPERT_Male, 0])

The next room contains *Protective Pads*.

!battle(["Terry", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

!battle(["Susan", :COOLTRAINER_Female, 0])

The third room contains a *Quick Claw*. Talk to a guy staring at the wall in the hallway from the right to open up a door to the left.

In this door, go to the left. Here you'll find the first tutors.

!tutor("OTS Move Tutor 1", [["Iron Defense", 1000], ["Snore", 500], ["Bind", 500], ["Spite", 250]])

!tutor("OTS Move Tutor 2", [["Magic Coat", 500], ["Magic Room", 500], ["Wonder Room", 500], ["Telekinesis", 100]])

It's worth noting that every tutor in the game will only charge you once per move - so don't feel bad about deleting a tutor move once you've learned it once since you can go get it back for free.

In the room above there are more tutors!

!tutor("OTS Move Tutor 3", [["Gravity", 500], ["Magnet Rise", 500], ["Block", 500], ["Worry Seed", 1000]])

!tutor("OTS Move Tutor 4", [["Snatch", 500], ["Helping Hand", 500], ["Ally Switch", 250], ["After You", 250]])

Head upstairs to grab the *Desert Field Readout*!

Head downstairs from here, head out to the main hall and go downstairs again.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Yes (+1 Hardy)

Enter the door above and to the right and talk to the girl for a *Telluric Seed*. Unlock this gate for a backtrack shortcut. Head to the left.

!battle(["Trey", :YOUNGSTER, 0])

!battle(["Lithi", :COOLTRAINER_Female, 0])

!battle(["Destry", :YOUNGSTER, 0])

!battle(["Skye", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

Proceed to the left a few rooms for another rival battle.

!battle(["Fern", :Hotshot, 1])

Fern can be tough to defeat now that his Budew and Rowlet have evolved. Roselia likes to try to tank your attacks and heal back thanks to Leech Seed and Mega Drain, while Dartrix tries to hit hard with its STABs or go for an omniboost. Sandile can sweep with Moxie if you're not careful, so lead with something that can handle it and you should be fine.

Before we continue to the gym, now is a good time to wrap up a couple of quests and areas.

First, head on over to the Arcade. With our Coin Case, we can now go to town here. Note that by interacting with NPC's and random tiles throughout, you can pick up 1205 Coins for free.

!shop("Onyx Arcade Coins", [["50 Coins", 1000], ["500 Coins", 10000]])

Unless you're coming back here really late in the game, don't buy coins. They're way too expensive, and starting with the free coins you can get up to the magic number needed to get all the rewards: 23900 coins.

You can play the slots, roulette, or Voltorb Flip. Previous versions of the guide recommended Voltorb Flip to grind all your coins, but I've since realized that the fastest strategy by far is the 100 coin Roulette board.

All you need to do is save before playing the board, pick any spot (12x payout), and play all seven balls. Note that you need to switch to a new spot if you get a jackpot on your current pick. Reset if you don't get a single jackpot on any of the seven balls, otherwise, save after all seven balls have been played. Even if you only hit one spot, you'll net 500 coins per round, a payout which only gets better the more jackpots you manage to get. You'll reach your target in no time.

!shop("Onyx Arcade TMs", [["TM45 Attract", "1000 Coins"], ["TM42 Facade", "4000 Coins"], ["TM90 Substitute", "7000 Coins"]])

These TMs have very wide pools of candidates, so grabbing them will generally be helpful in the early game when your movesets aren't complete yet.

!shop("Onyx Arcade Pokemon", [["Snover", "600 Coins", true], ["Slugma", "1000 Coins", true], ["Mantyke", "1800 Coins", true], ["Nidoran M", "3500 Coins", true], ["Shinx", "5000 Coins", true]])

All of these Pokemon have something going for them:

- If the egg we previously got was Remoraid, you can get Mantyke and immediately evolve it into Mantine, which is really overpowered at this point in the game.
- Nidoran M also can immediately evolve twice with the Moon Stone we got earlier, and Nidoking tears through this part of the game.
- Snover can generate Snow Warning, our first weather ability.
- Slugma
- Shinx is one of the first Intimidate users we can get and evolves quickly.

Back outside, head into the building to the left. Fern's friend will feel bad and let us access the rooftop garden. Up here you'll find *TM63 Embargo*.

!enc(128)

When the weather is clear up here, you can also find a **Pichu** behind a tree if you have snax in your bag.

There is another event we can do, but it only works on certain weekday nights. For now, we have access to three alleyways. You'll need to go to any one of the following:

- Obsidia Alleyway, on a Monday night
- North Peridot Alleyway, on a Thursday night
- Lower Peridot Alleyway, on a Friday night

Whichever you go to at the right time, you'll find a **Zangoose** digging through the trash that you can catch.

Finally, now is a good time to go finish the search for Lillipup.

After talking to it in the apartment in South Obsidia Ward it will randomly go to one of these five places:

- On the second pier from the top in Coral Ward
- To the left and up from the Central Salon in Obsidia Ward
- Between the Panpour / Pansear area and the Railnet in Opal Ward
- At the very north point of Peridot Ward by the closed gate
- In the northwest corner of Peridot Ward, nearby the apartment containing Snubbull / Stufful

Once you find it, head back to the Onyx Ward. To the left of the Move Relearner house, you'll see the owner with it. You can then obtain **Lillipup**.

## Rainbow Scent Quest

One more large sidequest has now opened up! This is a limited-time quest, so its best to get started on it now. If the battles are a bit too hard for now, the final time you can complete this quest is immediately after defeating the Bug-type gym leader.

Head down to the Obsidia Park area. Talk to the pink-haired girl if you are ready for a battle.

!battle(["Swarm", :RAINBOWSWARM, 0])

Combee and Venonat are fairly weak, allowing you to get set up. This is also our first encounter with Enemy Z-Moves: Pineco is holding the Buginium-Z.

Laura tells us that she is looking for three Pokemon with flowers on their bodies. Talk to her again to learn there is a Comfey with a gentleman somewhere in Peridot Ward. Head over to the Upper Peridot Alleyway when you are ready for a little gauntlet...

Note that all of the following are custom forms, where the only difference is their otherwise illegal movesets and abilities:

!battle(["BRUHCHAMP", :QCHAMP, 0])

!battle(["SAWKONDEEZ", :QSAWK, 0])

!battle(["DEEPTHROH", :QTHROH, 0])

Because these are all separate battles, you can't set up and steamroll the gauntlet. A fast Flying or Psychic type will probably be your best bet here if they can OHKO, though a full team of six can probably take down three Pokemon if the matchups are favorable enough.

After the scenes have concluded, you can get **Comfey**! Add this to your party and take it to Laura in Obsidia Park.

Laura wants to check out three Pokemon total: this Comfey works as one of them. Two more can be pulled from the following list: Ivysaur, Venusaur, Gloom, Vileplume, Bellossom, Meganium, Skiploom, Cherrim, Maractus, Roselia, Roserade, Flabebe, Floette, Florges, Shaymin, Aromatisse, Munna, Deerling, Sawsbuck (Spring), Wormadam (Plant), and Lilligant. At this point in the game though, we don't have most of these: unless you picked Bulbasaur as a starter, the easiest Pokemon to get at this point are **Gloom**, **Roselia**, and **Skiploom**, all obtained via evolution.

Completing this quest rewards you with the *Rainbow Scent*, an item that controls the rate at which wild Pokemon are attracted to you, as well as a **Petilil**!

## Canopy Badge

With all that out of the way we can head back to the gym. In order to battle Florinia, we're gonna need to answer all the quiz questions. The answers are here, from right to left:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    1, 367, True, 410, True, 37, 15, True
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Onyx Gym Quiz Answers</a>
</div>

Head to the left and enter the gym room for a battle.

!battle(["Florinia", :FLORINIA, 0], "Desert Field")

This is a pretty neat and out of the ordinary team that helps teach the player about the versatility of field effects. In general, the Desert Field actually doesn't really benefit Grass types or most grass type moves. Regardless, Florinia's team is mostly built around using the field successfully. Specifically, most of her team have at least one of Needle Arm, Pin Missile, and Sand Tomb, which are all boosted by the field. Cacnea's Sand Veil is always activated here, and Ferroseed's Telluric Seed allows it to gain a bit more bulk and speed in exchange for being trapped by Sand Tomb. Sandstorm lasts for eight turns on the field, and Ferroseed, Cacnea, and Cradily will all be immune to its damage while you may not. Cradily also gets a Special Defense boost from the sand, adding to its already strong bulk with Stockpile and Recover. On top of all that, Nature Power turns into boosted Sand Tomb, and Cottonee has priority with this move due to Prankster!

All that goes to show how even fields that aren't as *obviously* beneficial like Electric Terrain for Julia can lead to difficult challenges. Aside from Pin Missile Linoone you don't really have many options to get boosts from the field yourself yet, so the key will be to overwhelming her otherwise. Fury Cutter is a pretty great move for this fight - you can get around Ferroseed's Iron Barbs with the Protective Pads we found earlier, and after a few uses the move will tear through Cradily before it can bulk up. Snover is also a good option if you want to cancel out the Sandstorm with a different weather condition, or you could use Sunny Day with Castform or Cherrim to sweep with Fire moves under the 8-turn Desert Field sun. You could also try to run a Flying type offensive core, which ignores Sand Tomb and can pretty easily deal with everything except Cradily. A great example of having to think outside the box in Reborn; you can do it!

After winning you'll get the *Canopy Badge* as well as *TM96 Nature Power*. You'll also receive the *PULSE Dex* as well as the *PULSE Readout 5C*. The level cap also shoots up to 35!
