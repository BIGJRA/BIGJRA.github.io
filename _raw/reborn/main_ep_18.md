# Episode 18: Void-Kissed

Exit the gym! Time to progress the story just a little bit in order to knock out some sidequests.

Head over to Calcenon City, then enter "that one apartment building where a bunch of plot happens, for some reason". You know the one.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree with Hardy about charging the base (+1 Hardy, -1 Florinia)
- Disagree with Hardy about charging the base (-1 Hardy, +1 Florinia)

Head out towards Route 4. In the gatehouse, talk to Charlotte if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you believe her while you have >= 0 points with her (+1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you believe her while you have < 0 points with her (-1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you don't believe her while you have >= 0 points with her (-1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you don't believe her while you have < 0 points with her (+1 Charlotte)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you are going to do something about it (+1 Charlotte)

Head out to Route 4. On the east end of the right, you'll see Hardy standing next to a Rock Climbing wall, and as you might guess, he gives us *TMX9 Rock Climb*. Up the nearby hill would be where we'd go to continue the story, but we do have a few sidequests to take care of in the meantime!

## Reborn Restoration Project 3

With 16 badges in hand, we can finally complete the third and last of the Grand Hall restoration projects.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #3 (+1 Adrienn)

Once you've funded all three projects, the guy at the desk will give you the *Absolite*.

If you'd like to complete another one, the choices and corresponding references are here:

- [Affordable Living in Obsidia](#affordable-living-in-obsidia-project) ($60000)
- [Railnet Reconstruction](#railnet-reconstruction-project) ($100000)
- [Azurine Nature Center](#azurine-nature-center-project) ($80000)

## Starter Egg Quest Part 2

Since the last time we made progress on this quest, it is now guaranteed that we can complete all three of the restoration projects, meaning by now it is guaranteed that we can breed Bulbasaur, Chimchar, and either Oshawott or Litten depending on gang choice. We also recently found Rowlet, so we can donate four more eggs to Kamaya in the Grand Hall.

This brings the total up to 17/21 eggs donated; since we passed 15, that means we get the *Reset Disc- SPDEF* as a reward. The next time I will bring us back here, we will for sure have the last four starters to finish this quest.

## Rock Climb Exploration

We've chopped down menacing small trees. We've smashed brittle rocks and pushed aside heavy boulders. We've crossed massive bodies of water, gone up perilous waterfalls and dived down to the deepest trenches imaginable. We've lit up the darkest of dungeons and flown across the vast Reborn Region. But now? It's finally time to climb rocks.

You can probably tell we're reaching the endgame, so there are tons of excellent but optional rewards that we can now get with Rock Climb. Follow along to grab 'em all, or jump to the Route 4 section to get on with the story. Note that any rock walls that I don't mention here are merely shortcuts (and, mostly obsolete thanks to Fly).

### Climbin' at Azurine & Apophyll

I'll start with some easy ones. Fly over to Azurine Island. Surf up from the nature center - towards the middle of the big island, you'll see a climbable wall. At the end of the short path above it, you'll be able to pick up the *Poisonium-Z*!

Next, fly over to Apophyll Beach. Make your way towards Pyrous Mountain, and climb down to get *TM52 Focus Blast*. Hope you don't miss!

### Climbin' at Teknite Ridge

First, fly over to the desert. Make your way all the way to the Teknite Cave in the northwest. Progress through the cave until you reach the split paths on 4F. Use the top left exit and make your way all the way to the dead end.

By hopping across some rocks to the top left corner, you'll notice a climbing wall. At the top, you can find a hidden *Ability Capsule* and a **Jangmo-o** egg! Sweet.

That's not all we can do in the Teknite Ridge, but we will be accessing a different side of the ridge to finish up.

Fly over to the Beryl Ward, and enter the Beryl Cave. On 1F, you can use Rock Climb to access a new area. Grab the hidden *Red Shard* and head into the next room, which has a hidden *Hard Stone*. Climb up once more to emerge into a new section of the Teknite Ridge.

!enc(744, nil, nil, "Teknite Ridge (Beryl Cave Side)")

Hidden on this map, we can obtain a *Green Shard*, *Energy Powder*, *Dusk Ball*, *Common Candy*, and *Calcium*. Enter the cave at the top.

!enc(746, nil, nil, "Teknite Cave (Beryl Cave Side)")

Grab the hidden *Heart Scale*. We'll need to transform this field to Dark Crystal Cavern - using the TM for Dark Pulse, this should be doable.

Once you succeed, smash the wall at the top and proceed to the next room. Head up once you're ready for a fight.

!battle(["Fulgor", :VOLCARONA, 0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

A fight against one strong Pokemon! Pick up the *Catching Charm: Ruby* here, as well as the hidden *Fire Stone* and *Ability Capsule*. Talk to the sunburst thing in the top right side of the room to battle and catch **Larvesta**!

Exit the cave. You can fly out from the Ridge.

### Climbin' at Route 2 and Route 3

Fly to the Celestinine Cascade. By heading down the stairs from the Fiore Gym, climb the first rock wall you see to get *TM28 Leech Life*. If you haven't moved the nearby Crustle to access the cave behind it, Rock Climb will make doing this easy.

Make your way to the north side of Route 2. On the right, you'll see a short climb leading to 5 *Exp. Candy XL*.

Next, climb the ladder to Route 3. Climb down the single tile Rock Climb to skip the first cave, then go as far right as you can. Enter the next cave and climb the rock in the top left corner inside to get a hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. From here, proceed all the way through the cave as we did once before until you emerge back on Route 3.

From here, go right and climb down the rocks nearby. Grab the hidden *Synthetic Seed* and enter the nearby cave. Here, you can get *TM53 Energy Ball*, a *Dragon Fang*, and a hidden *Full Restore*. Exit this cave.

### Climbin' in Tanzan Depths

Fly over to the Tanzan Cove and enter the main part of Tanzan Mountain. Go past the meteor base and down the stairs to enter the Tanzan Depths.

In the area where we fought Steelix, make your way to the top left and climb across the metal beam. Climb up here. You'll find a *Muscle Band*, *Rock Memory*, *Big Nugget*, and *Kangaskhanite* here as well as hidden items: *Escape Rope*, 4 *Tiny Mushrooms*, *Green Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Exp. Candy XL*, *Awakening*, *Blue Shard*, and *Carbos*.

!battle(["Will", :PkMnRANGER_Male, 0], "Cave Field")

Enter any one of the three caves.

!enc(614, nil, nil, "Tanzan Depths (Gem Caves)")

Use Earthquake, Magnitude, etc. in a battle twice to make some green crystal gems fall - this is necessary to explore the other part of the Tanzan Depths.

Use an Escape Rope or Dig to save time if you'd like, and return to Tanzan Cove. Surf across the cove and enter the Tanzan Mountain entrance here. Climb down the rocks.

In the next room, you can find an *Exp. Candy XL* as well as a hidden *Super Repel*, *Escape Rope*, 2 *PokÃ©Snax*, *Purple Shard*, *Stardust*, and *Great Ball*, as well as tons of mining rocks. Once you get everything, break the ground by using Magnitude or Earthquake twice in battle once more.

The floor will collapse, creating a new climbing wall. Head down. In the next room, talk to the Green Crystal to get Larvitar to move. You can get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Awakening* in here. Proceed to the next room.

Here is the first of the Larvitar puzzles. By knocking down the four green crystals, we can use them as directions that we want Larvitar to go. As long as there is a path in the specified direction (up, down, left, right) to a translucent rock, it will go there and remove it. I will provide routes in invisible text that remove the most rocks and allow you to get all items.

  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Larvitar Puzzle 1 Solution</a>

Pick up the now-accessible *Jolly Mint* and *Timid Mint*. Proceed to the next room.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    L U R D U R3 U L R D R L U R U L R6 D R2 D L D2 L D U R D2

</div>

Pick up the now-accessible *Focus Sash*, *Modest Mint*, and *Nugget*. The door in the bottom left side where Larvitar entered will lead you to an *Ability Capsule*. Backtrack and enter the next room in the top right.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">

</div>

Pick up the *Amplifield Rock*, *Adamant Mint*, and 4 *Glitter Balls*, then proceed. In this next room, you can get the *Rockium-Z* as well as a hidden *Dark Gem* and 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. And, you can battle and catch **Larvitar**!

That's all we can do here, so escape from this cave.

### Climbin' in the Iolia Valley

Make your way to the east side of Route 1, then Rock Slide down into the Iolia Valley. Make your way to Luna's gym room. You can actually rock climb in here.

Do so, then use the purple crystal to grab a *Dark Material*. Exit the cave.

We should now have 3 Dark Materials - one is at the top of the waterfall in this valley, the other was in the locked room of the Sanctum. With all three in your bag as well as a Soul Candle, fly over to Lapis Ward and make your way down to the Subseven Sanctum.

Talk to the summoning table for a battle with **Deino**.

### Climbin' in the Mountains

Next, it's time to enter the three-mountain complex one more time for a few goodies. Fly over to the Route 1 Nature Center, grab a Tauros and make your way to the Celestinine Mountain B2F entrance via the North Aventurine Woods.

At the top of the ice puzzle, you'll see a climbing wall. Go up it, then surf to the left and push the nearby boulder to the left. Rock climb back down, this time making your way down the stairs to the left of the ice puzzle. Head up past the pushed boulder to get a *Life Orb*. Pokemon Showdown, here we come.

From here, our next destination is Ametrine Mountain 2F. You can either go through the mountain complex to get there or just fly to the Circus or Ametrine City and make your way there that way.

We've gone this path once before to get some items. Climb the waterfall in the northeast side of Ametrine Mountain 2F to reach 3F, then cross the ice north. Carefully go across the ice on the top left side to climb another fall to 4F. Once you reach 4F, save the game for in case you mess up, then beach at the top. You'll see a rock chilling in the middle of the ice puzzle towards the top left side. Drop down the ledge such that you'll be stopped by that rock, then go right and up into a climbable wall. Grab a hidden *Blue Shard* then go up to 5F.

Complete an ice puzzle here, grab a *Paralyze Heal*, then take the waterfall down. Not down one floor, not two, but down EIGHT floors, you'll land on Ametrine Mountain B4F.

!enc(379)

Yay, another pseudo legendary now obtainable.

On this floor, you can also pick up the *Icium-Z* as well as a *Jolly Mint* and 4 *Exp. Candy XL*. You can also find a hidden *Burn Heal* and *Antidote* down here.

That's all we can do in here, so escape the mountains however you please.

## Upper Route 4

That wraps up all the optional rocks that we can climb, so fly on back to Calcenon and head east to where Hardy is on Route 4. Climb the rocks here.

Note that there are a lot of different encounter tables for the various maps of Route 4.

!enc(713, nil, nil, "Route 4 (Forest Maps)")

!battle(["Rhett", :HIKER, 0], "Forest Field")

On the map you can get a hidden *Red Shard*, *Guard Spec*, *Heart Scale*, and *Green Shard*. Climb the rock to the next map.

Grab a hidden *Cotton Candy* here then use the left of the two rock climbs to go up. Grab a hidden *Telluric Seed* and proceed up the next slope.

!battle(["Lena", :RANGERF, 0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Autumn", :AceTrainerF, 0], "Forest Field")

You can get a hidden *Max Repel*, *Red Shard*, and *Escape Rope* on this level. Towards the bottom left side, there is a climbing path that goes down and left. Climb down it.

This brings us back to the first map we were on, at a different point. Grab a hidden *Synthetic Seed* then climb up the rocks on the left. Grab the *Full Restore* and the hidden *Green Shard*.

Make your way back to the previous map and go up the slope towards the top. On this map, a chill will settle in the air.

!enc(712, nil, nil, "Route 4 (Mountain Maps)")

Pick up the hidden *Super Potion*. As hinted at as we entered, we're going to need to transform the field. Battles are fought on the Mountain Field - to transform it into Snowy Mountain, you'll need to use Blizzard, Subzero Slammer via the Ice type Z crystal we got previously, or by letting Hail be on the field for 3 turns. Piloswine will be able to use Blizzard, so you can try to encounter one if you don't have these moves.

Once you do, snow will gather on the map.

!enc(721, nil, nil, "Route 4 (Snowy Mountain Maps)")

Grab the *Ice Stone* atop the hill once you're able to. Climb back down the hill, and back down to the first fork. Climb up the hill to a new map with a lake on it.

!battle(["Seal", :BLACKBELT, 0], "Forest Field")

On this map, you will find a hidden *Red-Hots*, *X Sp. Def*, *Magical Seed*, *Ice Gem*, *Salt-Water Taffy*, *Ice Heal*, and *Hyper Potion*. There are lots of paths we can go from here, and I will start by doing the rock climb path in the top left, accessible via surfing on the water. To reach the water, surf from the hop rock with the little stairs at the bottom.

On the next map you can find a hidden *PokÃ©Snax* and an *Ice Stone*. Climb back down the hill.

This time, go around the rocks in the water to climb the waterfall at the top.

Grab a *Revive*. This is another map in which we'll need to transform Mountain to Snowy Mountain. Do so.

Once you succeed, climb the mountain. We'll land on a higher part of a map from earlier. Grab the hidden *Stardust* and enter the shed here.

Pick up *TM73 Thunder Wave*. Press 'A' while you're above the disconnected wires to connect them, prepare your team, then make your way to the top left corner for a fight.

!battle(["CL:4R1-C3", :BRELOOM, 0], "Short-Circuit Field")

This is a very tough fight with a custom, overpowered Breloom robot! With mixed attacks, the ability to put you to sleep, and a set up move, it can sweep. Wear it down with status conditions and stat debuffs to win!

Once you win, a **Gastly** will pop out of the robot. It will run around the robot to hide from you, but you can battle it by talking to it if you're quick enough. I recommend disabling speed up for this part.

Return to the area with the lake. This time, take the rock climbing path in the top right corner. Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* here.

As you're hinted to do, we'll need to transform the Snowy Mountain Field here into a Mountain. Many of the burning Fire type moves like Lava Plume and Fire Pledge will do the trick. You can also use a Fire type Z-move. Once the field is changed, you'll be sent to a new map. Use the hopping stones to enter the cave.

!enc(750)

As in the previous map, it is hinted that we're gonna want to change the field, this time from Icy Field to Cave Field. Doing this will open the above water encounters as well as letting you grab the *Heracronite* and hidden *Focus Sash* in the pond.

This room also has a secret. From the pond, go clockwise around the ring. You'll be able to sneak behind a rock here. A counter-clockwise loop will lead to 3 hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. Follow the loop clockwise, until you see the shortcuts in the bottom walls to climb up further. Use these to reach the cave exit, but don't go out quite yet. From here, follow the outermost loop clockwise all the way around to get a hidden *Big Nugget*. Backtrack this loop, then exit the cave at the bottom.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* and *Nugget*. Talk to Bagon here and show it how to Fly... and it will do so, off the cliff. Backtrack through Charous Mountain all the way back to the map with the lake.

This time, make your way all the way to the bottom right corner of the map. Climb down here. Once more, burn the Snow on the Mountain away to uncover the *Lycanium-Z*. I think it's worth noting here that in Pokemon Reborn the exclusive Z-move Splintered Stormshards carries forward its canon effect of destroying Field Effects... including all of Reborn's custom ones. If you really find yourself in a rut of being unable to deal with an opponent's field synergy, it may be worth considering training a Lycanroc to remove it.

Climb back to the previous map, this time going down the rocks to the left. 

!battle(["Fawkes", :Casanova, 0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Nicky", :HIKER, 0], "Forest Field")

You can find a hidden *Swift Wing*, *Big Pearl*, and *Chesto Berry*.

Use the rock wall in the bottom right corner to reach a new map. Grab the hidden *Escape Rope* here. Transform the field to Snowy Mountain and a new rock climb path will be created, so follow it up.

Pick up the *Ultra Potion* and hidden *Liechi Berry*, then melt the Snowy Mountain as we've done before. In exchange for a Revive, you'll be able to obtain our friend from earlier and the final pseudo-legendary: **Bagon**.

Head back two maps. This time, use the rock climb in the bottom-left corner to go down to another map with a large lake.

!battle(["Simon", :AceTrainerM, 0], "Forest Field")

You can find a hidden *Elemental Seed*, *Ultra Ball*, *Moon Stone*, and *Rawst Berry* here. Surfing across the water to the little island, you can get a *Max Elixir* and a hidden *Heart Scale*.

Climb the rocks in the upper left corner to reach a new section of the first Upper Route 4 map we landed on, containing the *Mimikium-Z*. Let's snuggle forever. Return to the previous map.

That's it for Route 4 exploration and goodies, so talk to Hardy in the big open area on the left side of the area.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Take on Hardy's bet (+1 Hardy)

Enter the building, and look around with Hardy. Once he leaves, follow him outside and talk to him again. Move the metal plate. If you took on the bet you'll get $2000.

Up and to the right, you'll see a now-accessible ladder, and Absol. Don't we love it when Absol shows up? Head down the ladder...

## Glass Workstation

Talk to Hardy, then follow him into the elevator. Talk to Bennett.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say "To be stronger than anyone" (-1 Bennett)
- Say "To win Luna" (Neutral)
- Say "To make things different" (+2 Bennett)
- Say that you don't remember (+1 Bennett)

Once you wake up, climb up the ladder, and go left into the opening. Follow Glaceon down the path. You'll see one of its abilities: to bridge short gaps on the upper floor with its ice. Jump down to the bottom floor. There's a door towards the bottom here which contains a healing machine and PC.

This building is basically a big puzzle. Feel free to skip ahead if you'd rather solve it yourself.

Talk to Glaceon again to see another of its abilities: creating a path over lava. Confront the Meteor Grunt at the top, and he will run away. Thankfully there is another way in: down and to the left, you'll see a glass window! By now hopefully we should know what to do when we see glass.

!battle(["Geoff", :MeteorAceM, 1], "Factory Field")

Defeat the Team Meteor Grunt, and talk to the monitor in the corner to open the door. Glaceon will start to follow you. You can talk to it to heal status conditions on your team members for free. You can also choose whether to pet Glaceon or not, for the quest but also for points and a different battle later on. Pretty intense choice, I know.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Glaceon (+2 Lumi)
- Don't pet Glaceon (-3 Lumi)

Exit this room and make your way left. Use Glaceon's ability on the lava in both places, then make your way to the left. Glaceon can also create paths across sand, so do so here. Make your way to the top left side of the room and attempt to enter the small room towards the top. Defeat the grunt.

!battle(["Bruno", :MeteorAceM, 1], "Factory Field")

He'll lock you out, so make your way back towards the right. A path will be cleared for you, so break the nearby glass and defeat another grunt inside.

!battle(["Ray", :MeteorAceM, 1], "Factory Field")

Talk to the monitor in the corner to open the door, then talk to Espeon's cage. We can't get it out of here quite yet, however.

Exit this room at the bottom. You'll notice another glass window to the right, which you can again smash your way into. 

!battle(["Sanchez", :MeteorAceM, 1], "Factory Field")

Defeat the grunt and pick up the *Timid Mint*, 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, and *PP All*. Exit this room.

There's nowhere else to go but up the ladder to the right. Unfortunately Glaceon can't follow you up the ladder, so keep that in mind. Anyways, follow this linear path into another room and defeat the Meteor.

!battle(["Devin", :MeteorAceM, 1], "Factory Field")

Grab the *Cage Key*. Head all the way back, join back up with Glaceon, and free Espeon!

Espeon can use Future Sight, which shows a blurry image of our next objectives. Helpful if you get stuck... or you can just read on. Anyways, you can also choose to pet Espeon for the quest, and for points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Espeon (+1 Eve)
- Don't pet Espeon (-1 Eve)

You'll notice that Espeon and Glaceon won't both be able to follow you at the same time, so you'll need to position the one you don't wanna take with you in the right place. You'll see what I mean now: switch to Glaceon outside, then head to the left of the nearby pallet of glass. Talk to Glaceon, and tell it to stay where it is. Head back to get Espeon, who can use telekinesis to move glass. Back on the side where Glaceon is, move this glass pallet up by interacting with it, then pressing up.

From here, go right across the sand, then up at the first lava bridge. Move the glass at the top to the left, then smash your way into the nearby room via the window. 

!dbattle(["Deryl", :TechNerd, 2], ["Naoman", :TechNerd, 2], "Factory Field")

Defeat the two scientists here, then talk to the monitor at the top to unlock the elevator.

Back outside, move the right glass pallet down to save a bit of time later on. Make your way to the bottom right corner of this room and move the glass up to get the *Sablenite*. Move this pallet back down by going around.

Heading left, you'll see three pallets of glass close to each other. Before we move these, you're going to want to actually swap Espeon for Glaceon. Drop off Glaceon on the right side of these three pallets. Go pickup Espeon once more, and move the pallets respectively up, left, and down to open a path.

From here, swap back to Glaceon, then drop it off near the ladder in the bottom right. Head back up to grab Espeon, then make your way back to the ladder where Glaceon is. Move the nearby glass up, then enter the door to the right. 

!battle(["Arcturus", :NWCultist, 1], "Factory Field")

Grab the 2 *EV Boosters* then return to the main room and go left. Move the bottom-most of the three glass pallets back up so we can pass along the bottom. Switch to Glaceon and make a path over the ice in the bottom left. Switch back to Espeon.

Enter the bottom left room where we found the key. Move each of the five glass pallets left to reach *TM29 Psychic*! Exit this room. Cross the lava and move the nearby glass up. Go right from here, and move a glass pallet to the right to get the *Gyaradosite*!

Make your way to Glaceon, and reverse the steps we took to get both Pokemon to the bottom so that both Pokemon are now back towards the top. After clearing a path to the elevator in the top left corner, switch to Glaceon and head up to B1F.

From here, follow the path to the left, bridging gaps with ice. Enter the next room. 

!battle(["Kaiden", :NWCultist, 1], "Factory Field")

Defeat the grunt to pick up 3 *Exp. Candy XL* and an *EV Tuner*. Back at the elevator, go straight to the right and use Glaceon to bridge a gap towards *PULSE Readout 8*. Up and left from here, you'll find a room containing glass, so we'll come back later. Continue bridging gaps and enter the room on the right.

Back in Ametrine Mountain, we made a choice whether or not to give Blake the Ruby Ring. If we gave him the ring, we will have the following fight:

!battle(["Aster", :AsterKnight, 5], "Factory Field")

It's been a while since we've seen Aster on this route. This time he encorporates a few of Eclipse's Pokemon into his own team. As usual, he focuses on Rock and Ground types, with Passimian there to provide hard hitting coverage. His team is generally pretty fast and physical, so speed control and/or some physical tanks will probably be able to find success. If you can tank an Explosion from Solrock and set up, he has no priority moves to prevent a sweep. He'll give you the *Meteor Card*.

If you refused to give Blake the Ruby Ring, grab the *Meteor Card* at the top. You can also get 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Open the pods in this room.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Use Heal Bell on Noel (+1 Noel)

Take the elevator back to the bottom floor. Before we continue, take Glaceon into the elevator where Hardy is sleeping.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Use Heal Bell on Hardy twice (+1 Hardy)

Next, switch back to Espeon. Return to the room on the upper floor with the glass. Move the glass out of the way. Note that despite every pallet in the dungeon so far appearing to only move "along the grain", you'll need to push the bottom right one down to finish this puzzle. It's a bit odd but mess around with this puzzle a few times and you'll figure it out. Anyways, you'll get a *Reborn Ball*! This is Reborn's Master Ball.

Return to B2F, and switch to Glaceon. Move Glaceon up and to the left of the rightmost sand pit, then switch back to Espeon. From here, take Espeon to the top right, pushing the first and second glass pallets to the right. Head back and switch to Glaceon, then use it to make a path across lava in the top left. Grab the 5 *Exp. Candy XL*.

Position Glaceon exactly in this spot:

!img("glass_glaceon.jpg")

Next, pick up Espeon and stand directly under Glaceon. Move the two glass pallets out of the way, then deposit Espeon up and to the right in exactly this spot:

!img("glass_espeon.png")

Switch to Glaceon and make a bridge across the lava to the north. Switch back to Espeon and head up, moving two more pallets out of the way and revealing the Meteor Card scanner. Use it to open the door.

Undo the moves we did to reach the top right corner. Head to the top left corner and use Espeon to finally clear a path to the door. This is it for exploration. Prepare your team as best you can for the shenanigans to come, and enter the door at the top!

### The Glass Gauntlet

Now begins one of the most glorious parts of Reborn. I'll let each of the fights speak for itself.

!dbattle(["Cain", :Cain, 6], ["Shelly", :SHELLY, 3], "Factory Field")

This battle is our first 12v6! On average each of our Pokemon has to be knocking out 2 each in order to win this thing. While that is a fairly large disadvantage, there are lots of tactics we can use to come out on top in this fight: The best advice I can give for Reborns 12v6 doubles fights (there will be more) is that conserving momentum is extremely important. In this case, Cain and Shelly each have Pokemon all 7+ levels *under* the cap, and neither team is particularly suited to abuse this field effect in particular, so it's a good fight to ease into the 12v6 setup.

Shelly's entire team is weak to Rock Slide, so it's not a bad idea to operate from the doubles priniciple: "support your Rock Slider at all costs". Heat Wave is also pretty potent here for similar reasons - a sun team can devastate here. You can fairly easily opt for a speed control strategy of some sort - Magic Bouncing back the Sticky Web or embracing it and abusing 8 turn Trick Room are excellent choices. You can also use Factory Field to your advantage blah blah... you knew that by now. Optimize your team to the max cap, come with a strategy to conserve momentum, and you'll be able to find a way to come out on top.

!battle(["?????", :QMARK, 0], "Factory Field")

Ok, so after finally overcoming a fight with all the odds stacked against you... surprise, a singles fight against a mystery trainer. You can't switch out your team at all but thankfully you do get a heal before this one.

Here's the thing. This fight, generally speaking, isn't gonna be the worst thing in the world. It's a 6v6 and your opponent has a mostly frail team plus Umbreon and sort of Gothitelle. If that's all there was to say, I'd assume you'd be able to find a way through this one and that would be that. The problem is: *any Pokemon that are fainted at the end of this fight stay fainted for the next*, basically as if you use Full Restores on all living Pokemon and nothing more. And for the next fight, you'll really want as many Pokemon as you can take.

So, with the goal of simply making sure that every one of your Pokemon stays alive? Weavile has a Focus Sash, meaning your lead for the whole gauntlet needs to be able to deal two hits of damage without dying (or switch). Mismagius is fast and if you make the mistake of letting it set up a Nasty Plot, there's a good chance it will claim a soul or two. Honchkrow is really nasty, with Sucker Punch allowing it to punish weakened Pokemon. Umbreon is annoyingly bulky, with Foul Play to hurt your physical attackers even more. Mega Absol is really strong, and you're usually going to find yourself in a kill or be killed scenario with it. Finally there is Gothitelle... who has Shadow Tag and Calm Mind. Meaning if there's any Pokemon on your team the AI has realized it can beat by switching in Gothitelle at any time... that Pokemon is as good as dead!

So now you see the challenge this seemingly simple 6v6 fight offers. If you think you can beat the next fight with 4-5 Pokemon alive, feel free to try if you are having a hard time with this one. There are some general tips I recommend to make it through this one with minimal casualties, however. For Weavile, Fake Out, multi-hit moves, and Sandstorm are all viable ways to break the sash, so setting up your gauntlet team with one of these first in your party will probably help. Honchkrow likes to come in on a weakened Pokemon, so try to anticipate Sucker Punch and either switch or set up further if you can. Keep in mind if you're faster than Honchkrow, other priority moves like Quick Attack will go before Sucker Punch. Make sure you're always ready for a Gothitelle switch in, or maybe learn exactly when the AI will try to switch it in so you can pivot to something that can knock it out. Speed control, either by superior stats, Tailwind, Trick Room, etc., will then be key to one-shotting Mismagius and Absol before they can get you. If you are able to 2HKO Umbreon, it won't be able to heal itself, so making sure you have either a physical attacker that can live some Foul Plays or a really strong special attacker are key. Even though you already have to plan for other fights with your team... keeping these tips in mind will help you overcome this obstacle, hopefully.

Even after making it through the previous two battles, you're thrusted into a third, and surprise, its another 12v6. While opponent levels are indeed a bit lower, without being able to change your team after the previous two fights and the aforementioned faint follow-through, you might even be stuck doing this fight as a 12v4 or 12v5. The good news here is that almost everything in this fight is a frail Ice or Psychic type. The real exceptions here are Bronzong and Metagross, both of which are extremely bulky and can hit really hard on this field, Clefable, who likes to spread Paralysis as a lead, and Bisharp, who can keep up the pressure with Sucker Punch and has enough bulk to live a good chunk of even super effective moves. Ninetales' hail and Aurora Veil are, as always, very beneficial to their team, as is the 8-turn Psychic Terrain Alakazam will try to get off. Really seems like there are lots of threats and not enough Pokemon to cover them all.

Otherwise there's not really a ton I can say: spam 'D' to drop a save before this fight and just play it out as many times as it takes for you to realize where the threats to your team are, and how you can overcome them. Conserving momentum is key as before, Trick Room as always is very potent, and weather and/or the field can help you steamroll. Using Snatch or Brick Break to mess with Aurora Veil, changing the weather, etc. are good options. Even if you have dropped a save mid-gauntlet, don't be afraid to throw away some money (or load a backup save) to better prepare for the gauntlet.

Once you win this battle, you'll find yourself in an area simply called "???".

## Inside The Void

This area is fairly straightforward, as whatever branching paths there are don't really lead anywhere. It's a very story-centric area, so if you are digging the story, talk to every NPC you can and pay attention to your surroundings as you make your way through the void.

When you reach a table full of starters, talk to the position corresponding to the starter you picked when starting the game.

Later on, you'll pass Aya's segment. You can optionally talk to Cain for a third time.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Cain in The Void after Aya's section (+1 Cain)

After seeing Luna and Taka on the left side, a voice will talk to you. Prepare your team before going up, as there's a fight coming up!

!battle(["Hypno", :HYPNO, 0], "Starlight Arena")

The only way it's healing itself is with Dream Eater, so a Dark type can slowly whittle it down. With a 4X weakness to bug and a weakness to field-boosted Fairy moves, there's a good chance you'll have something to deal with it. You can also stall with Toxic! Chesto Berries, Safeguard, Sleep Talk, etc. can all help you deal with its 100% accurate Hypnosis as well. 

Keep following the path, and you'll eventually exit the Void. After another massive conversation, accept the fast travel request to get the heck out of the Glass Workstation.

## The Raid on Agate City

Back in Calcenon City, talk to Shelly towards the right side of the map. Enter the "story building" in Calcenon for some points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly while she is talking to Titania/Serra (+1 Shelly)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reshiram Route only: Talk to Titania while she is talking to Shelly (+1 Titania)
- Zekrom Route only: Talk to Serra while she is talking to Shelly (+1 Serra)

Talk to Eve near the Pokemon Center.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Eve and learn about all the PULSEs remaining (+1 Eve)

Enter the "story building" once more. The squad will leave for Agate City, so fly over to Vanhanen Labyrinth and enter Agate City from the south once more.

A note:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reshiram Route only: Talk to Titania while doing the Agate raid (-1 Titania)

Defeat the grunts as you progress upwards. 

!battle(["Ricardo", :MeteorAceM, 1])

!battle(["Christopher", :MeteorAceM, 0])

!battle(["Antoine", :MeteorAceF, 1])

!battle(["Ezra", :NWCultist, 1])

If and only if Titania was not fed during the Water Treatment Center back in Episode 15, Meteor Lyla will be alive and this fight will be a double battle with her:

!dbattle(["Ezra", :NWCultist, 1], ["Lyla", :NWCultistF, 1])

Past the Light Shard is a mini-gauntlet.

!partner(["Hardy", :HARDY, 0])

!dbattle(["Howaya", :NWOrderly, 1], ["Christina", :NWOrderlyF, 0])

This fight is a 12v10, with Hardy on your side. Shouldn't be too crazy with his help, just know that whatever team you prepare for the following battle is what you'll be stuck with for this one.

!battle(["Solaris", :Solaris, 2])

After all this time, we finally get to fight Meteor's Leader Solaris, one-on-one. No field effects are in play this fight: it's just the raw power of basically a Gen 7 OU team versus yours. Staraptor with Intimidate that hits hard? Yep. Technician Scizor with ridiculously strong Bullet Punch? Yep. Dragon Dance Gyarados? Yep. Tyranitar and Excadrill sand core? It's there! And on top of all that is his Mega Garchomp. That is not a typo above: it really does have max EVs in every stat, thanks to its PULSE 2. Get used to these for the end game. Essentially what this means is Garchomp will hit hard but also be bulky enough to live a couple of attacks.

At this point you also have a lot of mega Pokemon and Z-moves to your name. In particular, I find that the Icium-Z can often ensure a kill on Garchomp if you need. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a single special attack on his team... so you can focus your team entirely on physical defense. Some fast (or slow under Trick Room) special attackers running Fire, Ice, and Electric moves will be able to get 5 out of 6 of his party members super-effectively... leaving Tyranitar an excellent candidate for a Close Combat or something. I believe in your ability to defeat this guy!

Make your way to the right.

!battle(["Ama", :MeteorAceM, 0])

You'll reach a dead end, so surf up to the left of a tree to continue on.

!enc(763)

Climb the first waterfall and grab the hidden *Stardust*. After climbing the second waterfall, head to the left. You'll find a hidden *Quick Ball*. Go down the waterfall and dive down.

!enc(741, nil, nil, "Agate City Underwater")

You can find a hidden *Silk Scarf*, 2 *Potions*, *Ether*, *Quick Claw*, *PokÃ© Ball*, and *Ultra Ball*. If you surface on the right side of the area, you can climb some waterfalls to get the *Pinsirite*. Back underwater, enter the cave at the top.

In the next room, Lin will flex on us. Grab the hidden *Super Potion* and *Lucky Egg*, then backtrack to the main part of the city. To the east of the Pokemon Center, watch the scenes play out then talk to Shelly. Hardy will then extend an offer to challenge his gym!

## Agate City

We could accept Hardy's gym battle offer right away, but there are some sidequests with excellent rewards now open: to cut to the chase, we can actually get every single non-legendary Pokemon before fighting Hardy - and if we do get them all, there's a really awesome reward waiting for us. So, let's get into it.

Head to the left side of Agate City and into the Agate Circus.

Relationship Point Choices:
- (Refuse Blake Route Only) Talk to Ciel on the top left side of the circus after the raid (+1 Ciel, +1 Ace)
- (Give Ruby Ring Route Only) Talk to Samson in the Big Top after the raid (+1 Samson)

Back in Agate City, starting at the Pokemon Center, head straight to the left and enter the house here. Talk to the Hiker inside, who will leave for Route 4. We'll follow him later. Outside, grab a hidden *Purple Shard* above then enter the top building. If you previously joined the Magma Gang, you have the opportunity to do an in-game trade here: your Basculin for **Litten**.

Back at the Pokemon Center, this time go east. Talk to the lady in the house here to begin another quest, which we'll complete in a bit.

We'll come back to the next house up and to the right in a bit. Enter the apartment complex beyond, next to the rock climb. In the lobby, if you previously joined the Aqua Gang, you will have the opportunity to complete an in-game trade: your Oranguru for **Oshawott**.

Head up from here. Near the gym, you'll find a hidden *Everstone*. Back down and to the right, climb up the rocks in the northeast side of the city, and follow the path. Grab a hidden *Ability Capsule* as you scale waterfalls.

## Route 4 Sidequests

By climbing the top waterfall, you'll emerge in a new area of Route 4.

!enc(742, nil, nil, "Route 4 (North of Agate)")

Grab the *Ground Memory* as well as the hidden *Health Wing* and *X Sp. Def*. Climbing the waterfall at the top will return us to a map we had previously visited.

From here, make your way to the other map with the lake - you'll need to climb up a couple of rocks. In the southwest corner of the higher lake, you'll see the Hiker from Agate City. Talk to him for a battle.

!battle(["Karim", :HIKER, 0], "Forest Field")

Once you defeat him, he will let his Pokemon out to hang out on the map. Talk to the Hiker for 5 *PokÃ©Snax*. Talk to him again. He'll ask if you have a spare belt in your bag. By giving a Black Belt, you'll get a *Fist Plate*. If you don't have any Black Belts in your bag but you do have an Expert Belt, you can trade it for a *Life Orb*. Note that we will be able to get more Expert Belts in a bit, so don't feel bad about trading it away if you'd like.

Once you've done these things, give snax to the Pokemon. Specifically, give a snax to Altaria, then another to Golem. By doing so, a new rock path will open up, so climb down to reach a new area.

!enc(716, nil, nil, "Route 4 (Central Creek Map)")

Grab the *Sceptilite* and *Big Nugget*. Hidden here is a *Blue Shard* and an *Ultra Potion*. That's it for Route 4 for now!

## Magic Square Quest

Fly over to North Obsidia Ward next. North of the Spyce, enter the open door into the building where we once fought ZEL and Magnezone. Talk to the monitor in the first room, and use your Meteor Card on it. Talk to the now-open shafts behind to jump down.

In a room to the right, you can get an *EV Tuner* and 5 *Exp. Candy XL*. You can also read the book to the right to get some lore (including Sirius' real name LOL).

Back in the main room, time for one of the community's most dreaded puzzles. Talk to the monitor at the bottom to learn of our quest. We'll need to make it so both 3x3 squares are magic squares, that is, all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number: 15. Additionally, only the middle square can be the same across the two squares.

There are essentially two parts to this quest: figuring out what numbers you want where, and actually moving them into place. It's also worth noting that for some reason whether or not Saphira was kidnapped back in Belrose actually affects the starting positions of the numbers, but my solving method actually works for both versions.

### What Goes Where?

I actually graduated with a degree in Mathematics once upon a time and do Computer Science-adjacent stuff for a living. So I'm gonna nerd out for a little while. Skip ahead a bit if you just want to see what the solution looks like. :)

!img("magic_square_0.jpg")

First we are going to solve for what we are looking for. It can be proven fairly easily that the middle is 5. Here's why:

Notice that from the middle row: B1 + B2 + B3 = 15, and from the diagonals that A1 + B2 + C3 = 15, and C1 + B2 + A3 = 15. Adding these three equations and moving things around a bit, we see (A1 + B1 + C1) + (A3 + B3 + C3) + 3 * B2 = 45.

We also can observe from the first and third column that A1 + B1 + C1 = 15 and A3 + B3 + C3 = 15. Thus simplifying the above result leads to 3 * B2 = 15, so B2 is 5.

!img("magic_square_1.jpg")

I'll solve for just one magic square for now.

We might as well try putting 1 in a corner and seeing what happens. Since we can just rotate the square, without loss of generality we can see what happens when we place it in the top left corner of one of the magic squares and seeing if a contradiction arises. This will also force 9 to be in the opposite corner to keep with the 15 sum rule.

!img("magic_square_2.jpg")

Consider the highlighted tiles. Each cannot be 1, 5, 9 since each is used, so it must be inclusively between 2 and 4, or inclusively between 6 and 8. If the tile is at most 4, then the remaining tile in the row with 1 would have to be at least 10, which is impossible. If the tile is at least 6, the column with 9 would be too large. So there is no possible value that works in either highlighted tile, meaning that putting 1 in the corner leads to no solutions. Therefore, we can assume 1 is in one of the four tiles adjacent to the middle, making 9 appear opposite. Again without loss of generality due to rotations, I'll put 1 on the left.

!img("magic_square_3.jpg")

The column containing 1 has two empty tiles that will add up to 14, meaning the only possibility with the remaining numbers is for them to be 6 and 8 (as 2, 3, 4 are too small, and we can't use 7 twice). Since we can simply reflect our square across the horizontal line through the center, again there is no loss to generality to put 6 on top, and 8 below. Solving the diagonals puts 4 in the bottom right and 2 in the top right. Then all we have to do is put 3 and 7 into the final cells, which leaves us with one completed square.

!img("magic_square_4.jpg")

You can check that each row, column, and diagonal add up to 15 if you don't believe me. The final stipulation of this puzzle is that only the center can be the same across puzzles. To deal with this issue, I simply rotate the puzzle by 90 degrees: obviously the rows, columns, and diagonals all still add up to 15, but now each non-5 piece is in a different place.

!img("magic_square_5.jpg")

This is the solution we will solve for. Due to rotations and reflections as mentioned before, one or both of your squares may look different from mine.

### Moving Pieces Into Place

Now, we just have to execute. Some players seem to be driven kinda mad by this step, but I am here to tell you about an algorithm with a handy invariant that guarantees we can complete the puzzle pretty easily! Essentially, we will solve piece by piece: by column, then by row. In fact, we can guarantee that we will be able to solve the first five columns in this way without messing up anything that came before!

!img("magic_square_6.jpg")

Suppose we are solving for the highlighted tile on the left (the *destination*), and we need to move 5 in (the *target*). Note that the tiles in all the columns to the left (just column 1) have already been solved, and the tiles above our target as well (here, just column 2, row 1). We intend to keep the puzzle this way after putting the next tile into position. So, here's the algorithm:

- If the target is in the same column as the destination, we can do a few things.
    - If the destination is the top tile, simply move the column until the target is at the destination, then we are done.
    - If you the destination is the bottom tile, then the tile will already be correct, so we are done.
    - Otherwise, the destination will be in the middle, and the target will be in the bottom row. Simply move the bottom row right, the column now containing the target up, then reset the bottom row by moving it back left once.

- If the target is in the same row as the destination, move the column containing the target up once so that it is no longer in the same row.

!img("magic_square_7.jpg")

- Move the row containing the destination right as many times as it takes for the destination tile to be directly above/below the target.

!img("magic_square_8.jpg")

- Move the column containing the target up or down so that the target is now in the correct row.

!img("magic_square_9.jpg")

- Now, simply move the row containing the target back to the left until it is once more solved. You'll notice that if you did the steps right, it will leave all the previously solved pieces the same, and put the new piece into the correct spot.

!img("magic_square_10.jpg")

Next, you'd move a 3 into the destination below the 5 we just moved in, then the 2 into the destination: top tile of the next column, and so on. That's really all there is to moving pieces in the first five columns into place. Do so, and your puzzle will look something like this:

!img("magic_square_11.jpg")

In my case, the dashes will represent 2, 6, and 7. Moving the rightmost column up or down if necessary to put the correct number into the top right, either this will solve the puzzle right away, or it will have the other two numbers switched around. If this occurs, essentially it means that you put the wrong number into the left side puzzle. Your board should look somewhat like this in this case:

!img("magic_square_12.jpg")

There is a simple fix however: switch 6's. Simply move the right column up, the first row left, the right column down, and the first row right again. Finally, move the right column down once again.

Anyways, once you complete the puzzle, the *Darkinium-Z*, the *Gardevoirite*, and *TM24 Thunderbolt* will drop down. Very nice. You'll also notice that the screen has changed a bit: one number per column is now white.

Head on back to Agate City, and enter the building to the right of the Pokemon Center. Talk to the lady and give her the code in white we just found: 139749.

In the next room, you can get the *Manectite* as well as *Department Store Sticker: Manectric*. Hallelujah. You know what that means!

!shop("Department Store 11F (Left)", ["Rocky Helmet", "Shed Shell", "Expert Belt", "Safety Goggles", "Flame Orb", "Toxic Orb", "Wise Glasses", "Wide Lens", "Muscle Band", "Black Sludge"])

!shop("Department Store 11F (Right)", ["Magmarizer", "Electirizer", "Protector", "Reaper Cloth", "Dubious Disc", "King's Rock", "Dragon Scale", "Razor Fang", "Razor Claw", "Metal Coat", "Deep Sea Tooth", "Deep Sea Scale"])

A lot of high-tier held items and evolution items, all now available in bulk.

## Murmina's Quest

Fly over to Calcenon City next. Down the steps to Route 3, go east and into the little cave. Inside, you'll find a trainer who will fight you!

!battle(["Murmina", :MURMINA, 0], "Factory Field")

This is actually a somewhat tough team, with Mega-Steelix in the back as well! Nothing you can't handle, though. She'll leave, talking about Caroline's basement. This next part of the quest is pretty obscure.

Fly over to Agate City, and enter the building below the gym. There is a child in the bottom right (who kinda blends in with the chair?!) who will let you access the basement. Pay very close attention to the tiles in this basement, then fly back to Calcenon City.

Enter Charlotte's gym, and make your way to the back. I actually mentioned this before in the guide, since you can open the secret door at any time, and doing so earlier allows us access to an extra Charlotte point and an early Mega Stone. If you didn't open the door then, we need to make the tiles in the back section of Charlotte's gym match the tile layout in the random Agate basement. It should look like this when you're done:

!img("calcsecret.jpg")

Follow the path from here and grab the *Charizardite X* if you didn't get it earlier. Give Murmina the Family Picture we once yoinked from a shelf in the Belrose Manse. She'll gift us a **Torchic** egg. Very nice.

## Bee's Pokedex Completion Quest (Part 1)

Fly back to Agate City, this time heading into the small house towards the right side of the city. The girl inside is named Bee, and she'll basically offer us rewards for every 100 Pokemon we've added to our Pokedex. At the point in my playthrough I was playing parallel to this guide, I had 569 Pokemon. Your mileage will certainly vary depending on what evolutions you've done, which Pokemon you've bred, etc., but I think it is a safe assumption that if you've been following along closely, you'll have at least 500 Pokemon at this time. So, you'll get the following rewards:

|Pokemon Caught |Reward         |
|---------------|---------------|
|100+           |*Galladite*    |
|200+           |**Froakie**    |
|300+           |*TM13 Ice Beam*|
|400+           |*Scizorite*    |
|500+           |*Electrium-Z*  |

Clearly some excellent rewards in here, and we're not even done with the quest.

## Starter Egg Quest Part 3

Did you notice? After obtaining Froakie, we actually now have obtained all 21 starters! Breed whichever of Oshawott and Litten that is newer, as well as Snivy, Torchic, and Froakie, donating all four eggs to Kamaya in the Grand Hall.

For reaching 18 eggs donated, you'll be given the *Reset Disc- SPEED*. The rewards for donating all 21 are even better: you'll get *TM26 Earthquake*, *Psychium-Z*, and *Garchompite*.

## Completing the Pokedex (Minus Most Legendaries)

Even better: did you notice? After obtaining Froakie, we actually now have obtained at least one member of every single non-legendary evolution line in the game, plus Type:Null and Phione. This also means that we actually can carry out the rest of Bee's quest right now, before we even get the last two badges! That also means that we're going to have to do a lot of evolving and breeding... so if you don't care enough about these rewards, or would rather do the quest later, you can skip this part.

The following is a table of Pokemon you'll need to breed or evolve at this point in order to complete the Pokedex:

|Pokemon to Obtain  | Method                                            |

## Bee's Pokedex Completion Quest (Part 2)

Fly back over to Agate City once you've gotten all 731 Pokemon so far. Talk to Bee once more.

|Pokemon Caught |Reward         |
|---------------|---------------|
|600+           |*Groundium-Z*  |
|700+           |*Blazikenite*  |
|731            |**Poipole**    |

Hell yes. One of the best Ultra Beasts is ours, before the last two gyms!

Use the move relearner or tutor to teach it Dragon Pulse and give it a level, and it will evolve into **Naganadel**.

## Geode Badge

Well, not much else to do for now than to finally take on the seventeenth gym leader.

Enter the Agate City gym and defeat the three trainers on the right side. 

!battle(["Alistair", :GUITARIST, 0], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Xavier", :GUITARIST, 0], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Noivy", :GUITARIST, 0], "Rocky Field")

Talk to the guy in the top left corner for a guide to the gym. The guy here will play a musical riff that we are supposed to change the blocks on the right to match musically.

If you talk to the guy again and say "Help", he'll battle us, then tell us what to play.

!battle(["Isaac", :GUITARIST, 0], "Rocky Field")

Bottom to top: turn the blocks to C, E, high G, B, B, low G, A, A. Climb the rocks once you do so, and enter the newly opened room.

!battle(["Hardy", :HARDY, 1], "Rocky Field")

This might be the "simplest" gym fight yet: Boosted Rock Slide spam! On Rocky Field, it adds extra damage when it flinches you. His team minus Gigalith are all fast and hard-hitting Rock types that all have this move, many above the level cap. That's really all there is to say about him: you'll be hit hard, fast, and likely flinch a lot.

If you are able to dispense with Gigalith, a slow team can steamroll his frail Pokemon under Trick Room. You can also take advantage of the move Wide Guard to prevent Rock Slide spam. Your own Rock Slide spam will also be reasonably effective here as his team doesn't resist Rock.

When you win, you'll get the Geode Badge, which boosts our level cap up to 95. You'll also get *TM80 Rock Slide*. Sweet.
