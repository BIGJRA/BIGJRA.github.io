# Chapter 3: Tainted Light

Eldest will give us *2 Super Potions*. Accept the fast travel. From Route 2, talk to Aelita at the train station to head into the city. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Complete Karrina's gang quest before Ch. 3 (+2 Aelita)

Some of the Gearen shopowners have their usual inventory for sale to the left if you need items. I recommend having an Oran Berry in your bag for later. Anyways, make your way to the sewers. Talk to Amanda for a battle.

!battle(["Amanda",:TRAINER_AMANDA,1], "City Field")

This is a surprisingly tough battle thanks to Miltank. Once it paralyzes your Pokemon and starts stomping, it's hard to get off a hit sometimes. Putting Miltank to sleep long enough to knock it is one way to win this one. Anyways, after battle, she'll give you *HM01 Cut*!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'll get it done! (Karrina +2, Aelita +1)
- ... (Neutral)
- I'm kinda scared... (Karrina -2)

Enter the sewers, cutting trees along the way to reach the back room.

## Chrysalis Manor

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Hi Lucha. (Venam +1)
- You're Venam's friend? (Venam +2)
- Have we met? (Neutral)

!enc(390)

After Venam asks you to figure out how to get in, read the inscription to the right: Password #3: 8187. Head over to the left side and enter the left hole in the hedge to get a weird key. Use it on the first gate. Go up, then go through the hole on the left and open the second gate from behind. Talk to Venam at the door, then sneak in the window.

Answer the questions as you like. When you regain control, head upstairs and talk to Marianette to get her to join your party! 

!partner(["Marianette",:LEADER_MARIANETTE,0])

Talk to her in every room of the house for background info. Enter Indriad's room by talking to the maids guarding it.

He'll send you on three trials. Before we do that though, talk to the maid in the entry room and she'll give you a bonus trial we can do while completing the others.

Take the downstairs left door to the Hedge Garden. Essentially a Dusknoir will warp us back if we ever turn around, so make sure you're always following the red ivy to continue. We can come back without Dusknoir in a bit to get all the items.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yeah, I am. (Marianette -1)
- It was nothing... (Marianette +2)
- You flatter me... (Marianette +1)
- Say it again. (Marianette -2)

Afterwards you must fight a servant!

!battle(["Moya",:SERVANT,0], "Grassy Terrain")

This can be tough, but Marianette's Pokemon do help out.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It was cool. (Neutral)
- Calm down. (Marianette -3)
- You were a great help! (Marianette +3)

Enter at the top and save Luca.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're growing. (Marianette +2)
- Yeah, you are. (Marianette -2)
- You can change that! (Marianette +3)

Back in the maze, there are some items. From the top: you can get a *Sitrus Berry* by going up past three red ivys. Continuing on, you'll see a maid:

!battle(["Lara",:SERVANT,0], "Grassy Terrain")

Defeat her to continue the extra maid quest. In the northwest corner is an *Elixir*. Dead ends in the middle of the maze give us two *Super Potions* and a *PP Up*. Another dead end in the bottom right leads you to 2 *Exp. Candy M's*. A path in the southwest leads you to a *Normal Gem*. Finally, a dead-end to the west says Password #1 is 7896. 

Now follow the right path through the mansion. In the dining room, talk to Marianette, you may randomly get a chance to give her an Oran Berry.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Give Marianette an Oran Berry in the dining room (+7 Marianette)

Exit to the right. If you hug the left wall and go through a secret passage, you'll see another inscription. This one says Password #2 is 3135. Head up and beat the second optional maid, Yara, hiding in the left corner.

!battle(["Yara",:SERVANT,100], "Grassy Terrain")

At the top, you need to navigate two pieces onto the colored tiles, but the buttons control both pieces. Carefully use the walls to your advantage to solve this one: 

1) L U R U L U L L R
2) L U U U L R
3) L L U R R R R

Three times and you're done: save Lenny.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- To instill fear. (Marianette +2)
- Who knows? (Marianette -1)
- It's a fun hobby! (Marianette -3)

Next, head back out the way we came in through the courtyard. Talk to the maid in one of the gardens to the south, Deandra, for a battle.

!battle(["Deandra",:SERVANT,0], "Grassy Terrain")

We've now fought all three maids, so return to the one in the main room. She unlocks all the doors in the mansion! Head through the door on the left and go up. Inside you'll find a *Full Heal, Reverse Candy, Ability Capsule*, and *Elixir*. Talk to Marianette while you're in here and ask about a box to fight a **Bronzor**. 

Finally, return to the room we woke up in and go through the upper doors. You can't go through with Marianette with you, so we'll have to come back when she's not with us anymore.

Head back into the courtyard and enter the Absol statue.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'll be fine! (Marianette +1)
- HURRY AND FREE ME! (Marianette -4)
- It's okay, stay calm (Marianette +4)

The first two rooms are not too hard, grab the *Max Repel* while you're at it. In the final room, you just must push the colored statues onto the respective tile without getting caught by Tangrowth, then guide Tangrowth to its own tile.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You did well. (Marianette +4)
- You cut it kinda close... (Marianette -2)

If you have at least five points with Marianette right now, you'll get the following dialogue choice:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's okay Marianette. (Marianette +8)
- I don't know... (Marianette -12)

Now that Marianette is no longer following us, we can go through the path in our room again. Enter the three passwords (7896, 3135, 8187) in the machine, then head through the frozen prison to speak with Anju.

To get an item, tell her the truth here. To do so, tell her the world is safe, Sheridan is safe, but Hiyoshi is destroyed. If you do answer truthfully, she will give you *Anju's Pendant*!

## Normality Badge

Exit and return to the mansion. Before we proceed, exit all the way out to Gearen to pick up what Aelita dropped: *3 Super Potions, 4 Exp. Candy M, 2 Exp. Candy S, 2 Chesto Berries*, a *Cheri Berry*, and *Protective Pads*. Back in the mansion, in the main doors, there is an Audino breeder, and each time you win, you'll get 5 *Exp. Candy S*.

!battle(["Miikal",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

As soon as you're ready, follow the path up from here.

!battle(["Marianette",:LEADER_MARIANETTE,0], "Blessed Field")

!move("MULTIPULSE")

Overall, what is said in by the gym guide is good advice. The first thing you must be cautious of is Delcatty, who likes to Baton Pass +2 in both defenses to Chatot or Drampa, who can then boost and go on a rampage. A move like Roar is a good counter for that. Otherwise, a decently rounded team should be able to deal with most of the Pokemon here - four are dual types with varied weaknesses.

Once you win, you'll be awarded with the Normality Badge! Our new level cap is now 35. Enjoy the following cutscene. Head outside to talk to Aelita and get *TM42 Facade*!
