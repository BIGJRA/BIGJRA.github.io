# Chapter 10: Stopped in Our Tracks

There's just a few more things we can do before leaving on the train. Up on the Valor Cliffside, if you donate to a guy 10 Rock types, you'll get a *Protector*, which you can use to evolve Rhydon.

Next, head over to Luck's Tent. There is another move tutor!

!tutor("Marlow Move Tutor", [["Aqua Tail", "4 Blue Shards"], ["Laser Focus", "4 Red Shards"], ["Spikes", "4 Yellow Shards"], ["Reversal", "4 Green Shards"], ["Endure", "4 Green Shards"], ["Amnesia", "4 Blue Shards"], ["Electro Ball", "4 Yellow Shards"], ["Ally Switch", "4 Red Shards"], ["Hyper Voice", "4 Blue Shards"]])

We won't be able to come back for a little while, so I recommend you farm as much AP as you can and head to the AP vendor at the casino. On deck is the Golden Gauntlets. Make sure you have 8 Sitrus Berries for a quest in the next chapter.

## Grand Express

Talk to Melia in the train station in southwest West Gearen.

**Relationship Point Choices**:

## Route 7

We can return to the train to heal and use the PC.

!enc(350, nil, ["Old", "Good"], "Route 7 / Yui's Ranch")

Also, you can fight stationary **Sawsbuck** here. 

Down from here is a hidden *Blue Shard* and *Honey*. Surf to the left for a *Rare Candy*. To the left on land is a hidden *Green Shard*. Head east to enter Oblitus Town.

Talk to the crew on the hill, then again above the tracks. Grab the hidden *Link Heart* to the right, then follow them to the left. Go north.

Pick up hidden *Blue Shard*, *Green Shard*, and *Fire Gem*. Cross the bridge to the left and grab a hidden *Ultra Potion*.

!battle(["Shara",:KIMONOGIRL,0])

!battle(["Karla",:BEAUTY,0])

Enter the ranch area to the right and pick up the hidden *Yellow Shard*. There is a post here: talk to it to activate it. This is a Braviary Post that allows us to fly around Terrial Island, just like Floria's truck and Terajuma's Noctowl.

!battle(["Harvey",:CAMPER,0])

Grab the hidden *Moomoo Milk* and *Max Repel* to the right. Up from here is a hidden *Red Shard*, *Elemental Seed*, and *Pecha Berry*. Plus:

**ZCell 095: Yui's Ranch**

!img("zcell095.png")

Enter the northern barn on the ranch. You can find a hidden *Oran Berry*, *Stable Mulch*, *Sitrus Berry*, and *Moomoo Milk*. Next, enter the larger barn below. You can find hidden *Stable Mulch*, *Moomoo Milk* in the first room and then another hidden *Moomoo Milk* plus a *Revive* in the left room. Feed this **Miltank** eight Sitrus Berries for a chance to catch it.

If you completed all of the Kristiline Help Quests, there is a new quest we can do. In the house to the left, accept Ben's Sidequest upstairs. At night, head into the upper barn and talk to Ben again. You need to CATCH each Inkay outside. Ben will be kidnapped after... so we'll have to complete this quest later.

Head north from the ranch onto the Grand Bridge map. After the chat, reenter the map and grab *TM123 Self Destruct* on the right, and on the left:

**ZCell 096: Grand Bridge**

!img("zcell096.png")

Exit the ranch map in the bottom left to return to the first map of Route 7 from a different vantage point. Push a stone over the water to create a shortcut, then grab the *Ether* to the left. Enter the house barred by the cut tree at the top to meet the PC manager.

Down and left from his house is a secret cut tree - chop it down and go left onto a new map. You can battle on-map **Starly** here! Hidden on the map is a *Green Shard*, *BalmMushroom*, and *Red Shard*, plus:

**ZCell 097: Route 7**

!img("zcell097.png")

Head inside the trailer. Sleep on the bed to see a familiar face? Anyways, grab the *Buginium-Z* here and return to the previous map.

Back on Route 7, go to the bottom left corner and cross the bridge.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- She's in the city? (+2 Venam, +2 Melia)
- Something's happened? (-2 Venam)

Head left onto another map of Route 7. Follow Florin and Flora across the water.

!battle(["Flynn",:HIKER,0])

Head to the right from the hiker. You can spend time with Melia here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Hapi (+2 Melia)
- The food (-1 Melia)

To the right and up is a hidden *Yellow Shard* and *Blue Shard*, with a hidden *Reverse Candy* just across the water. In the map's top right corner is a hidden *Red Shard* and *PP Up*. Notably you can battle stationary **Scolipede** here!

Head to the top left of the map now. There is another Luck's Tent here. Nearby, activate a Braviary Post! Head north to a new map.

Get a hidden *Green Shard* and go up.

!battle(["Timmy",:COOLTRAINER_M,0])

Head east to reach Yui's Ranch again - the cops will now have moved. Cut a tree to the right for *TM107 Slash and Burn*. Up north, you can cut a tree to get *BrightPowder*. Head south then west to return to the previous map.

Go up to pick berries: *18 Sitrus Berries*, *18 Oran Berries*, and *3 Persim Berries*.

To the left:

**ZCell 098: Route 7**

!img("zcell098.png")

Enter the Milk Bar.

!shop("Magic Milk Bar", ["Oran Berry", "Sitrus Berry", "Moomoo Milk", "Rose Tea"])

That's it for this area, so return to Yui's Ranch, then go up and left to enter Honec Woods.

## Honec Woods

!enc(369, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Surf to the left. Find a hidden *Poison Gem*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Cleanse Tag*, *Leaf Stone* in this area. 

!battle(["Marco",:POKEMONRANGER_M,0], "Swamp Field")

Surf down from the southwest corner of the map and follow the path. 

!battle(["David",:BUGCATCHER,0], "Swamp Field")

There is another Braviary Post here: activate it. Go left at the fork to reach *3 Starf Berries*. The map to the left hasn't got much new but a slightly different encounter table.

!enc(370, ["Grass"], nil, "Honec Woods (Interior)")

Back in the larger map, make your way to the very top.

!battle(["Dewey",:TOURIST,0], "Swamp Field")

Grab a hidden *Reverse Candy* behind the tree and proceed to the next map. Pick up 2 hidden *Honey*.

!battle(["Resa",:LASS,0], "Swamp Field")

!battle(["Billy",:YOUNGSTER,0], "Swamp Field")

Cross the bridge at the top. Watch the scene play out here. You can also access the honey tree at the top, but it only works once a day. It will be either Forretress, Aipom, Burmy, or Combee... all of which we can get in easier ways. Pick up the hidden *Aspear Berry* here.

Head back to Yui's Ranch and talk to Ben. You'll get 3 *Cherish Balls*! (+1 Karma)

Now, the shop inside is in business during the morning and day:

!shop("Yui's Ranch Shop", ["Ultra Ball", "Hyper Potion", "GourmetTreat", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Escape Rope", "Honey", "Moomoo Milk"])

## Darchlight Woods

Make your way back to the hilly map of Route 7 and approach the bottom left corner. Behind a Geodude is a hidden *Lax Mint*. To the left, grab the hidden *TinyMushroom* and enter the Darchlight Woods.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- What are YOU doing here? (-1 Flora if Tyluric Temple complete, -1 otherwise)
- Just chilling, plank you. (+2 Florin if Tyluric Temple complete, Neutral otherwise)

!enc(358, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Grab the hidden *TinyMushroom* and *Big Mushroom*. Talk to a person above for *TM149 Draining Kiss*! Continue up from here and talk with Florin.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You know a lot about this! (+2 Florin)
- I'm not interested. (-2 Florin)
- Where do I start? (Neutral)

On this map, you can get hidden *Ether*, *Dark Gem*, *Reverse Candy*, and *TinyMushroom*. Get *TM95 Snarl* across the water.

**ZCell 099: Darchlight Woods**

!img("zcell099.png")

Talk to a blue tree on the right side of the map: Florin will cut it. Talk next to a tree on the hill at the left side of the map. Return to the previous map.

Head down and to the west, across the bridge.

!battle(["Mary",:FAIRYGIRL,0], "Bewitched Field")

Grab the hidden *TinyMushroom* on the water.

!battle(["Bella",:FAIRYGIRL,0], "Bewitched Field")

Activate a Braviary Post to the left. Head south and grab a *Bold Mint* and hidden *Dark Gem*. Go left to reach a new map. 

Grab the *Big Mushroom*. You can talk to **Impidimp** to catch it! In the top left of this map is a *Carbos*. Go north from here onto a new map. You'll find a hidden *Big Mushroom* and *HP Up*, plus *TM18 Rain Dance*! A map above contains a hidden *TinyMushroom*. Head through the gate and proceed.

## Darchlight Caves

Press up to escape when prompted.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's true (+2 Flora)
- She's lying lol (-2 Flora)

Head east and choose which characters to go with. You'll either choose to [go with Flora](#part-1-go-with-flora) or [stay with Florin and Erin](#part-1-stay-with-florin-and-erin). (The choice you make here just decides the next five minutes of gameplay.)

### Part 1: Stay with Florin and Erin

Follow Florin and Erin to the room at the top. Watch the video here. If you leave the video on, you can choose whether to [Expose Flora](#part-2-expose-flora) or [keep quiet](#part-2-keep-quiet). (The choice you make here has more ramifications on the story, though neither of them locks you out of the lategame routes).

### Part 1: Go with Flora

Follow Flora to the west. You can choose to follow Flora into the room above. You can then choose whether or not to **Expose Flora** about Bladestar. If so:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm so sorry. (+3 Flora)
- ... (Neutral)

In this room, we'll need to follow steps:

- Grab some Black Powder from the jar
- Put the powder in the box
- Send it right to the fire
- Send it left to the electricity
- Send it right to the plasma
- Press the button on the computer below at exactly 15 seconds.

Flora will get a Darchlight Mirror. Return to the group by going right a few screens. You will get the choice to [Expose Flora](#part-2-expose-flora) or [keep quiet](#part-2-keep-quiet). (The choice you make here has more ramifications on the story, though neither of them locks you out of the lategame routes).

### Part 2: Keep Quiet

Head into the room on the right. Find a hidden *Yellow Shard* and *Max Repel*. Go down, and you'll get the *Darchlight Mirror*. 

Pick up the hidden *Blue Shard*. We can't proceed down, so follow the path up. Grab the hidden *Ghost Gem* and enter this cave. Use the Darchlight Mirror again.

!battle(["Zyo",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Giratina will start chasing us.

!battle(["Kayo",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Pick up the *Rare Candy* and proceed.

!dbattle(["Lee",:BLADESTAR_M,0], ["Lana",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

!battle(["Shane",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Interact with the mirror in the next room.

Head to the right. You'll get a hidden *Ghost Gem* and *TM115 Mega Punch*. Across the bridge is a hidden *Ether* and *Reverse Candy*. Enter the Decompression Lab at the top. There is a *Hyper Potion* in the room to the left. Talk to the group at the top of the dark hallway.

!battle(["Enda",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

!battle(["Sufdhsjghdsj",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Head to the left when you can and talk to Flora.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I trust you (-2 Flora)
- I didn't want to (+2 Flora)
- I'm not sure myself... (Neutral)

Take a look at the screens. Cycle left and right through the footage and view each one until you see the one with the mysterious figure!

Head down from this room, then hug the right wall in the dark hallway to reach a new area with some conveyor belts.

Grab a hidden *Luxury Ball*, then cross the bridge over the conveyor belt. Grab the *Revive* and *White Herb*. Walk onto the upper conveyor belt. There is a hidden *Reverse Candy* in this next room.

Go back onto the rightward conveyor belt and continue rightward. Grab a hidden *Elixir* and take the topmost conveyor belt. Take the top right belt next and continue right to grab the *Dark Memory*. Take the warp and return to the previous fork, choosing the bottom left conveyor belt this time.

!boss("DARCHGIRATINA", "Dark Crystal Cavern")

This is a very bizarre boss fight, though thankfully not too hard. The first three forms hit pretty hard, so stalling it out with Protect and Light Screen and letting it die from Toxic damage is the way to go.

Talk to the group in the restaurant at the top. Accept Flora's [fast travel request](#darchlight-village--route-8)!

### Part 2: Expose Flora

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's not meaningless. (-4 Flora, -2 Erin)
- The evidence is sound. (+2 Erin, +4 Florin)
- Maybe we should rethink. (-3 Erin)

Head left and talk to Erin.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Erin's right. (+2 Erin, +2 Florin)
- You should have known. (-2 Florin)
- Maybe we should rethink. (-3 Erin)

Return to the Darchlight Mirror room. Make a *Darchlight Mirror* just as we did before:

- Grab some Black Powder from the jar
- Put the powder in the box
- Send it right to the fire
- Send it left to the electricity
- Send it right to the plasma
- Press the button on the computer below at exactly 15 seconds.

Head back to the east. Continue through the cave, using the mirror in the same spot Flora did to create a new path.

In the next room, get a hidden *Yellow Shard* and *Max Repel*. You'll choose between Erin and Florin as a partner here.

!partner(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL,0])

!partner(["Florin",:LEADER_FLORIN,0])

!dbattle(["Ken",:BLADESTAR_M,0], ["Yula",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Pick up the hidden *Blue Shard*. We can't proceed down, so follow the path up. Grab the hidden *Ghost Gem* and enter this cave. Use the Darchlight Mirror again.

Return to where we fought the grunts. You can choose to battle them or not.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Battle them. (+2 Florin)
- Florin, handle them. (-2 Florin)

!dbattle(["Zyo",:BLADESTAR_M,0], ["Kayo",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Pick up the *Rare Candy*. In the next room, if you chose to have Florin handle the previous grunts, you get to choose once again:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- After having Florin handle the first pair, battle this pair of grunts (+2 Florin)
- After having Florin handle the first pair, have Florin handle the second pair of grunts (-2 Florin)

Note that choosing to expose Flora and let Florin attack the grunts locks you into the story route **Berserk Florin**, which will eventually grant (+20 Renegade Points).

!dbattle(["Lee",:BLADESTAR_M,0], ["Lana",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Continue. Florin will handle this pair of grunts himself if he did the previous two.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- After having Florin handle the first two pairs, say "Florin is right" (+4 Florin, -3 Erin)
- After having Florin handle the first two pairs, say "You're taking it too far" (-2 Florin)

!dbattle(["Shane",:BLADESTAR_M,0], ["Partario",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Talk to Flora. This plays out differently if Florin attacked all the grunts so far. If so, you'll need to go up and into the room at the top.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- After Florin handles all grunts, say "That was reckless" (+2 Erin)
- After Florin handles all grunts, say "She had it coming (-6 Erin)

Go to the right. You'll get a hidden *Ghost Gem* and *TM115 Mega Punch*. Across the bridge is a hidden *Ether* and *Reverse Candy*. Enter the Decompression Lab at the top. There is a *Hyper Potion* in the room to the left.

Nearby, there is a dark hallway. Hug the right wall to enter a new room, grab a hidden *Luxury Ball*, then cross the bridge over the conveyor belt. Grab *Revive*.

!battle(["Sami",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Pick up *White Herb*. Walk onto this conveyor belt. There is a hidden *Reverse Candy* in this next room.

!battle(["Pearls",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Go back onto the rightward conveyor belt and continue rightward.

!battle(["Siri",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Grab a hidden *Elixir* and take the topmost conveyor belt. Take the top right belt next and continue right to grab the *Dark Memory*. Take the warp and return to the previous fork, choosing the bottom left conveyor belt this time.

You'll need to defeat Flora with Giratina in a different style of combat. Heal when you need to, use the special when you can, and you should win.

Flora will be arrested at the top of the lift. Accept the fast travel with Florin, though we won't be taking on the gym battle quite yet.

## Darchlight Village & Route 8

There are a few more maps we can explore. Head into the map at the top where we were pushed into the caves to grab some hidden items: *PP Up* and *Yellow Shard*. 

Go down two maps, then continue down to reach Azure Port. Talk to the grunts here to start the Oshawott quest.

!enc(371)

You can get a hidden *Max Repel* and *2 Pearls*. Not much else to do here for now, so return to the previous map and go left this time to reach Darchlight Village.

!enc(360, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Grab the hidden *Super Repel*, *Dark Gem*, *Yellow Shard*, *Roseli Berry*, *Magical Seed*, *Blue Shard*,. You can also pluck *4 Persim Berries* and *4 Sitrus Berries*. There is a breeder here: defeat yields *5 Exp. Candy L*.

!battle(["Jude",:POKEBREEDER_F,0], "Bewitched Field")

Head to the west at the bottom of the village, to reach Route 8.

!enc(361, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Wow, a whole lotta nothing new! Anyways, activate another Braviary Post. You can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Soda Pop*, and *Blue Shard* here. Follow the path left to the trailer.

!battle(["Julie",:XENMAGE_F,0])

Past the other exit of the trainer is another hidden *Blue Shard* as well as *TM156 Air Slash*!

Return to the Azure Port. Enter the building on the right.

!battle(["Aruti",:SPELUNKER_BLADEM,0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Grab the *Black Augurite* and return to Route 8. You will get **Oshawott**!

Before we continue, we can make a quick trip to Darchlight Caves. By taking Braviary to Darchlight Woods, to the right and up you can access a cave containing a teleporter to the Caves. Head up into the Decompression area, then go up through the door. Go right in this next room to get *TM97 Dark Pulse*!

Backtrack to the caves below. Make sure the cave is dark, then proceed to the left. You can find to catch **Bronzor (Aevian)**! Continue backtracking to reach **Wobbuffet** and **Wynaut** as well as *TM23 Smack Down*. Plus, you can find:

**ZCell 100: Darchlight Cave**

!img("zcell100.png")

You can take the lift at the top of the Decompression Lab to escape to Honec Woods.

## Rose Badge

Make your way back to the Darchlight Woods, and find your Grass-type gym leader waiting for a match above the crossroads. If you exposed Flora you'll [fight her brother](#vs-florin), otherwise you'll [fight her](#vs-flora).

### VS Flora

!battle(["Flora",:LEADER_FLORA,0])

!move("UPROOT")

Flora opts for a more defensive singles strategy, taking advantage of the field's many boosts to Grass types. Even though Grass has many weaknesses, her team has answers to them all, so you'll need to be able to change it up! Uproot will make setting up a defensive wall difficult, so finding a way to sweep with 1-3 of the types super effective against Grass or perhaps field-boosted Dark/Fairy will likely be key.

Win to get the Rose Badge, which increases our Level Cap to Lv. 70, and *TM53 Energy Ball*!

### VS Florin

!battle(["Florin",:LEADER_FLORIN,0])

The battle with Florin is a very tough one. Like Rhodea says, he has a team full of glass cannons. The field helps him get stronger while his only "intact" weaknesses are Flying and Bug, though he has counters for those. Changing the weather right away tends to be helpful, and using Dark and Fairy moves may be the key to heavy damage. Ice moves with Hail can be particularly potent.

### Aftermath

Regardless of who you fought: Win to get the Rose Badge, which increases our Level Cap to Lv. 70, and *TM53 Energy Ball*!

Head to the Darchlight Village and enter the southwestern house. Head back to the train to get *HM04 Strength*! 

## Darchlight Manor

Alright, I know the timing of this seems super weird, but we just got Strength and the badge to use it right before the chapter ends, and we won't be able to return here right away. So, I'll take us on this detour now, though feel free to do it at a later time. 

Enter the Darchlight Manor area to the north of the Darchlight Village.

!enc(408, nil, ["Old", "Good"], "Darchlight Manor (Exterior)")

Head inside.

!enc(112, nil, ["Old", "Good"], "Darchlight Manor (Interior)")

The first room contains a hidden *Ghost Gem*. A room on the bottom right contains a hidden *Blue Shard* and *Full Heal*. Exit to an outside area containing a hidden *Big Mushroom* and *Dark Gem*.

Back inside, enter the room in the top right. Pick up the *Old Gateau* and hidden *Health Wing*. The room at the top contains a hidden *Revival Herb*. Finally, enter the room on the left. Above is *5 Exp. Candy L* and *Blue Shard*. Outside, you can use the Darchlight Mirror to create a bridge to a hidden *Ghost Gem*. In the top room is a hidden *Spell Tag*. 

Use Strength to enter the bottom room. Grab the hidden *Elixir* then read the book below  Clefairy. Return to the entrance hall of the house to talk to Clefairy two more times. Follow it into the office at the top. 

Enter the room on the right, and grab the *Cabinet Key* from the cabinet at the top. Go left then into the top right room to talk to Clefairy in this cabinet. Enter the dining room downstairs to find Clefairy again... then follow it to the topleft room in the building. Interact with the left painting and enter the fireplace. Pick up *Gate Key*, *TM12 Taunt*, and: 

**ZCell 101: Darchlight Manor**

!img("zcell101.png")

Talk to Clefairy at the top of the entry stairs, then push the boulder down. In the next room, grab the *Old Gateau* and *Chipped Pot*. Exit left to get *Dread Plate* plus:

**ZCell 102: Darchlight Manor**

!img("zcell102.png")

Outside at the top, grab hidden *Ether*, *Purple Nectar* (repeatable), and *Tiny Mushroom*. Grab *TM114 Leech Life* plus

**ZCell 103: Darchlight Manor**

!img("zcell103.png")

Pull up the rope at the top, then talk to the doll to get a *Light Ball*. 

That's all we can do in the Darchlight Manor, but head back over to the Honec Woods. Use Strength in the bottom right corner to reach a new section of the map.

!battle(["Polo",:POKEMONRANGER_M,0], "Swamp Field")

There is a hidden *Big Mushroom* down from here plus another Honey tree. That's all for Strength exploration for now, since we cannot return to Floria or Terajuma yet.

To finish the chapter, get on the Grand Express, then talk to the group in your cabin.
