# Chapter 10: Stopped in Our Tracks

There's just a few more things we can do before leaving on the train. Up on the Valor Cliffside, if you donate to a guy 10 Rock types, you'll get a *Protector*, which you can use to evolve Rhydon.

Next, head over to Luck's Tent. There is another move tutor!

!tutor("Marlow Move Tutor", [["Aqua Tail", "4 Blue Shards"], ["Laser Focus", "4 Red Shards"], ["Spikes", "4 Yellow Shards"], ["Reversal", "4 Green Shards"], ["Endure", "4 Green Shards"], ["Amnesia", "4 Blue Shards"], ["Electro Ball", "4 Yellow Shards"], ["Ally Switch", "4 Red Shards"], ["Hyper Voice", "4 Blue Shards"]])

We won't be able to come back for a little while, so I recommend you farm as much AP as you can and head to the AP vendor at the casino. We won't be able to buy with AP until we get the HM for Strength, so get the Golden Gauntlets and any other of the AP items you haven't yet if you'd like. Make sure you have 8 Sitrus Berries for a quest in the next chapter.

## Grand Express

Make sure you're ready to not come back for little while. Talk to Melia in the train station in southwest West Gearen.

If you have at least 8 Points with Venam, you'll get (Venam +3 Relationship Points). You'll be given a *Soda Pop*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Thank you! (Venam +1)
- I don't like soda. (Neutral)
- I didn't ask for this. (Venam -1, Melia -1)
-   If you have 7 or less Points with Venam, say "what about me and
    Kanon?" for relationship points with him.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- What about me? (Neutral)
- What about Kanon and I? (Kanon +2)
- You're gross. (Melia -2, Venam -3)
    If you have 7 or less Points with Venam and chose "You're gross" in the last prompt:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sounds good. (Venam +2)
- No thanks. (Venam -2)

In the hallway to your car's right, a girl will tutor you:

Head all the way left and talk to Krystal. Head two cars right and you'll be able to exit onto Route 7.

## Route 7

Been a while since we walked onto a new route! We can return to the train to heal and use the PC.

To the left is the level 65 Audino trainer. Each time you win, you'll get 5 *Exp. Candy L*.

Also, you can fight stationary Stantler (Night) and **Sawsbuck (Day)** here.

On this first screen, there are hidden items, including: *Quick Ball, Rock Gem*, 2 *Green Shards*, 2 *Max Repels, Red Shard, Hyper Potion, Ghost Gem, Ground Gem, Fire Gem*.

Enter the house barred by the cut tree at the top to meet the PC manager.

Head one screen up. Cut trees to get *TM107 Slash and Burn*.

ZCell 058: Route 7

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image60.png"/>

Hidden on this map outside the fence boundary is a *Yellow Shard, Max Repel, Green Shard, Blue Shard, Pecha Berry, Red Shard, Ultra Potion*, and *Elemental Seed*.

Head up and around to the left to see the scene at the bridge.

Next, head a bit south to enter Yui's Ranch. Pick up the hidden *Moomoo Milk* and grab the *Brightpowder* hiding behind the tree by the barn door. Enter the room to the left and pick up the hidden *Moomoo Milk* and *Revive*. Talk to **Miltank**. If you feed it eight Sitrus Berries, it will battle you. Pick up the hidden *Stable Mulch* and *Moomoo Milk* in the main room, then exit the barn to the right.

ZCell 059: Yui's Ranch

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image61.png"/>

Head to the back of the ranch. On the right side, pick up the hidden *Fire Gem*, then enter the upper right barn. Hidden inside are *Moomoo Milk, Oran Berry, Sitrus Berry*, and *Stable Mulch*.

Exit, and enter the house on the left. If you've finished Kristiline's help quests, to continue a quest, head upstairs and talk to the guy here, and agree to help. At night, head into the barn on the upper right corner of the ranch. Talk to Ben, then head outside. You need to CATCH each Inkay, but it should be easy enough.

That's all we can do up here. Head west into the Honec Woods.

Surf to the left. Find a hidden *Poison Gem, Tiny Mushroom, Cleanse Tag, Leaf Stone* in this area. Surfing one tile to the right at the bottom, follow the path to the southwest corner, where you can get 3 *Starf Berries*. Head to the very top, find a hidden *Reverse Candy* behind the tree, then enter the map at the top when you're ready.

Pick up 2 hidden *Honey*, then head across the bridge at the top. Watch the scene play out here. You can also access the honey tree at the top, but it only works once a day. Pick up the hidden *Aspear Berry* here.

Head back to Yui's Ranch. You'll get 3 *Cherish Balls*! (+1 Karma)

Now, the shop inside is in business during the morning and day:

Yui's Ranch Shop

Then, head down a map. There are wild **Dodrio** here during the day. Hidden on this map are *Red Shard, Yellow Shard, Max Potion, Blue Shard, PP Up, Reverse Candy*, and *Rare Candy*.

Head east and talk to the group at the train.

Head south and enter Oblitus Town. Use your Itemfinder to find a *Link Heart* in town.

Enter the easternmost house and exit.

Then head to the west. Near Luck's tent, talk to Melia here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Hapi? (Melia +1)
- The food? (Melia -1)

Enter the Darchlight Woods to the west.

There are also wild Parasect during the day, Amoongus at night, and **Impidimp** wandering around the woods.

We can enter Darchlight Caves by heading down immediately, and hopping down the pillars, but there is nothing of note in here yet. While you're in this main area, talk to any of the people here 30 times. This is necessary for a side quest in a bit.

Hidden on this map are 2 *Tiny Mushrooms*.

Take the top exit north. Hidden here is another 2 *Tiny Mushrooms*, an *Ether, Dark Gem*, and *Reverse Candy*. Head up for a little scene with a girl.

ZCell 061: Darchlight Woods

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image63.png"/>

Next, head through the west door in the entrance map to access Sensu Meadow.

As in the other meadows, you can find infinite *Purple Nectar* here. We can't explore much here yet, but we'll be back. Head back to the main map and head all the way to the southwest corner via the pillars, grab the hidden *Dark Gem*, and enter the clearing.

## Route 8 and Azure Shore

Here are a couple small optional areas and quests, skip them if you'd like.

Head to the south. Hidden on the beach is a *Max Repel*. 2 *Pearls* are also hidden in the water on this map.

| Marill         | 1   |           |      |         |      |

Talk to the ranger near Samurott and agree to help find Oshawott. If you come here during the morning, two of the Samurott will give you a *Rare Candy* and a *Star Piece* respectively.

Exit the forest and head north to the broken bridge by the Grand Dream Gate. Talk to Oshawott, then bring it back to Samurott. It will then get stolen!

Head back to the crossroads and head west. Grab all 4 *Sitrus Berries* and 4 *Persim Berries* in front of the manor. We'll enter that in a bit, but head west onto Route 8.

Pick up the hidden *Red Shard, Soda Pop, Green Shard*, 2 *Blue Shards*, as well as *TM156 Air Slash* at the bottom.

Head up to talk to the ranger who stole Oshawott and battle her. Try to leave after returning it, to get **Oshawott**! (+1 Karma)

## Darchlight Manor First Visit

| **Banette**   | 5        |
| **Mismagius** | 4        |

There're only a few places we can go without strength, so start by entering the right room on 1F. Read the book and the doll will disappear. Next, talk to Clefairy twice in the main room, get the hidden *Full Heal* and *Revival Herb*, and then enter the room at the very top of 2F. Grab the *Max Repel* and talk to it again.

Rock Smash the rock on the side, then pick up the hidden *Blue Shard* and head upstairs. Talk to it on the couch, then in the bed in the room to the left. Exit, and smash the rocks to get to the south side of 3F. Talk to it, then enter the next room on the left and talk to it again. Move the candelabra up here and enter the fireplace to get *TM12 Taunt* and a *Gate Key*.

That's all we can do here for now, so make your way back to the crossroads.

## Darchlight Caves First Visit

Head north. On this map is a hidden *HP Up, Big Mushroom*, and *Blue Shard*. Surf up here to grab *TM18 Rain Dance*.

Head into the top right clearing first. If you have an Odd Keystone, have talked to people in the forest 30 times, and it is nighttime, talk to the tower to battle **Spiritomb**.

Anyways, head out and enter the northwest clearing. Pick up hidden *Tiny Mushroom, Yellow Shard, PP Up*, then speak to Flora and Florin in the top area.

Darchlight Caves

| Cave         | %   |
|--------------|-----|
| Bronzor      | 30  |
| Graveler     | 20  |
| Carbink      | 20  |
| Sandslash    | 15  |
| Wobbuffet    | 5   |
| Dugtrio      | 4   |
| **Bronzong** | 4   |
| **Wynaut**   | 2   |

After the conversation, we'll have control in the caves. Grab the hidden *Yellow Shard, Blue Shard*.

Head east and choose which character to go with - this one doesn't affect your future quite yet. Grab the hidden *Max Repel* abovve, then head down your ladder and in.

You'll have another choice to make in each room - this time about whether to expose that you saw Flora earlier either to her, Florin, or Erin. Again neither of these choices will force you into a bad ending quite yet, but will affect your gym leader fight for this chapter.

Head outside, and as you're walking, the cave will change. Head upstairs and watch whatever scene you got based on your choices. Head down the left ladder and cross the new bridge here. Hidden is a *Dusk Stone*. Down the right ladder there is a hidden *Blue Shard*.

Go upstairs and go down, then across the bridge, pick up the hidden *Dark Gem* at the bottom. Go into the cave entrance. Pick up the hidden *Ether*, then head down and watch the scene. Then follow your person south and into the cave, then across the bridge.

Basically, we're going to have to create a Darchlight mirror. Speak to your person and interact with all the reading materials to find a solution.

Here's the solution:

1.   Type in 4589758 into the password.
2.   Grab black shard ore and put it in the furnace.
3.   Push the red button.
4.   Push the blue button.
5.   Push the green button.
6.   Push the red button.
7.   Push the red button again.
8.   Remove the ore from the furnace.
9.   Push the blue button.
10.   Push the purple button.
11.   Push the gold button.
12.   Talk to the thing on the left with the small red button to  make a *Darchlight Mirror*!

Cross the bridge to the right, and head up. Interact with the gem on the wall up above. Head into the room on the left and go down to get a hidden *Psychic Gem*. Go up to get *TM23 Smack Down* and a hidden *Rock Gem*.

ZCell 062: Darchlight Caves

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image64.png"/>

Head right and cross the new bridge. Up is a hidden *Hyper Potion*. Head all the way south, picking up the hidden *Ether* as you go, and then activate the crystal. Pick up the hidden *Revive* and *Full Heal*, then head back up and left. Up at the top, there is a hidden *Carbos*, to the left a hidden *Reverse Candy* and *Ghost Gem*. On the left is a *Dark Material* as well as *TM115 Mega Punch*.

Head back east and cross the new bridge. Head down to get *TM145 Hex* and hidden *Everstone*, then activate the gem here. At the bottom is a hidden *Revive*, then head up. Pick up the hidden *Max Potion* and head up.

Follow the path, activating crystals as you go. Climb the elevator to exit and beat the Dugtrio mech.

After you get outside, if you chose Flora, now's your chance to expose her for real, or not. Again, this won't necessarily rope you into the worst ending, but if you do want the option to go that route, expose Flora here.

Watch the events unfold, then head out of Honec Woods. Make your way back to the train and talk to Melia.

## Rose Badge

Two more things to do - the Sensu Meadow is now opened. Grab *TM114 Leech Life*, and a hidden *Dark Gem, Ether*, and *Tiny Mushroom*.

ZCell 063: Sensu Meadow

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image65.png"/>

Make your way to the hole towards the top of the meadow, then fall. In the cave, grab *TM97 Dark Pulse* and hidden *Ice Gem* and *Magical Seed*, then exit by getting lulled to sleep in the bottom right corner of the mushroom.

Then, head back to the main map, and go to the southeast and hop down the logs. Surf up and east here to access Darchlight Cave again. Grab the *Dark Memory*.

Head to crossroads and go north. Find Flora/Florin in this area and get ready to battle. Florin battles Doubles and Flora singles.

Uproot: Grass \| Special \| 90 power \| 100% accuracy \| 100% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by 2 stages \| On Bewitched Woods Field, power is boosted x1.5.

Each of these battles tries to neutralize Grass' many weaknesses. Be careful of both of their Ludicolo, who will outspeed you thanks to the rain. Mega Sceptile hits really hard and fast and can heal itself, while Mega Venusaur tanks two of its weaknesses thanks to Thick Fat and can wear you down with Giga Drain and Leech Seed. On both teams, Uproot can be threatening if you're attempting any kind of defensive strategy, so going for a fast offense somehow might be safer.

There are lots of ways to win! Sunny Day changes the weather and the field to Rainbow, meaning Poison moves and Fire moves are particularly effective again. Alternatively, you can focus on a Tailwind based Flying-type core, since only Ferrothorn, Rotom, and Cradily take neutral damage from them. One other strategy would be field manipulation via Pyukumuku's Purify, which turns the field to Forest and gives Bug moves a boost.

Win to get the Rose Badge, which lets us level to 70, and *TM53 Energy Ball*!

Head towards Darchlight Manor and talk to Erin. Then, head back to the train to get *HM04 Strength*! Talk to Melia in the cabin.
