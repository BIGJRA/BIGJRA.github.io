# Chapter 15: Vague Clarity

We will be taken to Sashila Village. Before continuing the story, a whole bunch of quests are open to us now that we have defeated Ryland.

## Zone Zero Quests

Take a Braviary over to the Pyramid Outskirts and go up. 

!enc(606)

Surf to the left side and the right side of the pyramid to get *Ground Memory* and *TM28 Dig*. Could've been useful 15 minutes ago! You can also give a treat to **Riolu** for a battle.

Next, enter the Eclysia Skyview, then make your way down the lift. Once you use a teleporter, head left and surf up and across. Pick up the *Magic Wand* here, then exit the pyramid.

Make your way to the south side of Zone Zero. You'll see two open doors to the same apartment building. Enter the one on the right first.

!battle(["Venus",:CHALLENGER,0], "Big Top Arena")

These mad lad developers did it - they made Ledian decent! It's punching moves hit 4 times, meaning it's gonna do lots of damage with coverage and priority options. The rest of Venus's team is effective too, though almost entirely because of the team's synergy with the field.

Reborn players should be used to this field by now, but here are some strategies that tend to work on this field. Revelation/Petal/Fiery Dance are all boosted under this field, so a team using these that targets their low special defense might succeed. Dragon/Swords/Quiver Dance also boost stats even more, so a sweeper might see success here if they can get the opportunity to set up. Acrobatics also is boosted here and can help you get rid of Ledian, Rillaboom, and Centiskorch.

Succeed to nab the third *Star Shard*, as well as the *Ledian Crest*, and a *Somniam Mall Stamp*.

Outside, enter the building to the left. Go up and climb down the ladder to reach the area where we were ambushed by Bladestar.

**ZCell 134: Apartment Depths**

!img("zcell134.png")

Head up after grabbing this cell to get an *Ability Capsule*! Then, head left and follow the path all the way to the left to grab the shiny Lux Apartment keys. Exit the building and go straight to the right. Enter the tall apartment building with the key.

We have to complete a puzzle similar to Generation III's Abandoned Ship backrooms.

- Enter 1A. Interact with the upper right sparkle, one tile left from the top right.
- Enter 1F. Interact with the upper left tile on the table.
- Enter 1E to study the sparkles.
- Enter 1D. Interact with the rightmost tile of the bed.
- Enter 2F (upstairs) to study the sparkles.
- Enter 2E. Interact with In the bottom tile of the bed in the 2F side.
- Enter 2C. Exit via the 2B door.
- Enter 1B. Interact with the tile two above the right rock. Exit left.
- Enter 2D. Interact with the center tile to get the final key. Plus:

**ZCell 135: Lux Apartments**

!img("zcell135.png")

- Enter 2C and exit via the 2B door again.
- Enter 1C. Go down the ladder, click the lever in this area, and pick up *Rocky Helmet*.

To the left from the Zone Zero Pokemon Center on the northern map, you'll find that a gate has opened, leading you to be able to catch **Gible**, plus:

**ZCell 136: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell136.png")

Fly over to Kakori Village. Enter a house on the left side and present the *Magic Wand* to get **Fennekin**!

One more quest in the desert area: make your way to the southeast corner of the Zorrialyn Desert by Poiloethal Forest to begin the *Poisonous Luck* quest. Follow Jangmo'o to Luck's Tent in Zorrialyn Coast. Inside, you'll be able to purchase **Jangmo'o (Aevian)** in exchange for 13 Black Prisms!

Take the time to breed Aevian Jangmo'o and take the spare to a house in Zorrialyn Desert East. We can trade it for **Jangmo'o** (the Alolan kind)!

## Narcissa's Hauntings Conclusion

If you've progressed Narcissa's Hauntings so far, you can now continue this quest.

Fly to the Rose Theater, and enter Forlorned Cavern on Route 9. Enter the first room in the main area of the cave, with the Timesplicer Stone. After a scene with Narcissa, accept the fast travel to the Cliffside Grave if you've been already -- if not, [you'll need to explore Amethyst Cave](#amethyst-depths). Talk to her again, then accept fast travel to Phasial Cave.

Head up and watch the scenes play out. Then, in Narcissa's house, talk to her upstairs. Head out and go to the Wispy Tower. Talk to young Narcy here and go in. Enter the lab, and head left. Talk to her again. Enter the western room, and surf up. Watch the CD Rom, then return to Narcissa's house and talk to them again. Accept fast travel.

Follow the Rotom into the cave, then take the time crystal to the past. Interact with the safe here. Then, pull the lever in the top left corner, hiding in boxes. Go down the ladder and out. You can find hidden *Revival Herb*, *Full Heal*, *Health Wing*, and *Blue Shard* throughout the building. Unlock the gate, and head in.

After a scene, talk to Narcissa and agree to go. Enter the manor and head upstairs to the top left room. Talk to the safe after another scene for the *Fairy Memory* and *Shiinotic Crest*. Exit to the well in the backyard.

Grab the *Code Rembrence Rift Notes* and head up.

!partner(["Narcissa",:LEADER_NARCISSA,1])

!boss("DUFAUX", "Bewitched Field")

Dufaux is a difficult boss. Each phase of the fight adds something to Dufaux until it becomes a speedy spread move sweeper, so you have to do what you can to prevent this from happening. Narcissa is a very solid ally with supporting moves: using moves like Wide Guard and Protect to buy her time will help. Trick Room notably makes the final phases easier.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Finish Narcissa's Hauntings (+6 Narcissa)

Head to the Lost Castle. All the way at the top, you'll get a chance to battle **Rotom**!

Fly to West Gearen and go talk to Gabriel at the West Gearen power plant. Follow him left, up, and up to get access to a room where you can change Rotom's form! You'll also get another *Somniam Mall Stamp*!

## Missing Children 2

If you've completed all the steps of the *Missing Children* quest with Ana and Dylan so far, make your way to GDC. Make your way to the Underground. On the right side, you'll now be able to find:

**ZCell 137: The Underground**

!img("zcell137.png")

Enter Dylan's house.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sorry...! (+2 Particia, +2 Dylan)
- Yeah, that's my bad. (Neutral)
- I don't need to call. (-2 Particia, -3 Dylan)

Accept the fast travel request. Talk to Sienna in the mortuary, then head to the Pokemon Pinnacle to the left. Make your way to the top of the dungeon.

If you defeated Ana earlier:

!newself(["Ana",:NANO,1])

If you let Ana win:

!newself(["Ana",:NANO,2])

!dbattle(["Misa",:BLADESTAR_F,0], ["Peter",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Haunted Field")

At Pokestar Studios, talk to Ana on the right. Follow her to the left again and let the scenes play out. Back in the Underground, proceed left past Dylan's house.

!battle(["Nicole",:LADY,0], "Back Alley")

!battle( ["Rojin",:WORKERF,0], "Back Alley")

!battle(["Kurt",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "Back Alley")

You'll be taken to Dylan's Kristiline Town house. Head outside, then follow Ana to the Sapphire Museum. Follow her next to the Lava Cookie restaurant. After that conversation, go back to Dylan's and talk to her there. Talk to her once more to the left of the Pokemon Center.

Fly to Teila Resort and head to Route 5. The easiest way to reach the Secluded Shore is to dive down on the east side of Route 5, then surface just above the entrance to the Secluded Shore. You'll get 5 *Lava Cookies*!

Back in Kristiline, fly to Teila Resort and talk to Ana in the middle. Gather intel from the townspeople then talk to her again. We don't need to win the challenge, but if you'd like to, choose these options from her questions: first, fourth, second. Then talk to Gigiorno in the middle to get it started.

Back in Kristiline again, enter the house. That's all we can do in this quest for now!

As this quest showed, we now have access to Grand Dream City once more. There are a few things we can take care of. First, enter Scholar District and enter the Fan Club. For beating Adam we should now have enough reputation that when we walk in, we will get a *Somniam Mall Stamp* as well as the *Aerodactylite*! Talk to a girl to get the *Poisonium-Z* as well!

Head west to the Festival Plaza. There is a new tutor on the left.

!tutor("Festival Plaza North Tutor", [["Superpower", "6 Yellow Shards"], ["Heat Wave", "6 Blue Shards"], ["Stealth Rock", "6 Red Shards"], ["Future Sight", "4 Red Shards"], ["Flip Turn", "5 Green Shards"]])

We've now collected eight of the ten stamps for the mall, so we can buy a whole bunch of new stuff.

!shop("Somniam Mall Rare Gems", ["Fire Gem", "Water Gem", "Normal Gem", "Grass Gem", "Electric Gem", "Poison Gem", "Ground Gem", "Fighting Gem", "Flying Gem"])

!shop("Somniam Mall Rare Gems", ["Psychic Gem", "Bug Gem", "Rock Gem", "Ghost Gem", "Dark Gem", "Dragon Gem", "Steel Gem", "Ice Gem"])

!shop("Somniam Mall Miscellaneous", ["Big Root", "Focus Band", "Zoom Lens", "Scope Lens", "Link Heart", "Ability Capsule"])

!shop("Somniam Mall Rare Berries", ["Petaya Berry", "Liechi Berry", "Apicot Berry", "Lansat Berry", "Starf Berry", "Ganlon Berry", "Salac Berry"])

!shop("Somniam Mall TMs & HMs", [["TM150 Grassy Terrain", 10000], ["TM151 Electric Terrain", 10000], ["TM152 Misty Terrain", 10000], ["TM153 Psychic Terrain", 100000], ["TM34 Sludge Wave", 30000], ["TM55 Scald", 13000], ["TM90 Substitute", 10000], ["HM05 Waterfall", 150000]])

!shop("Somniam Mall Evolution Items", ["Protector", "Magmarizer", "Dragon Scale", "Electirizer", "DeepSeaTooth", "DeepSeaScale", "Up-Grade", "Dubious Disc", "Prism Scale", "Sachet", "Whipped Dream", "Razor Claw", "Oval Stone", "Razor Fang", "Reaper Cloth"])

## Atebit Doctor Quest

Make your way once more to the Eclysia Pyramid. Up the stairs on the right, you'll be able to enter a rift to return to the area with all the "GameBoys". Walk into the first to talk to Talon, beginning the *Atebit Doctor* quest.

Take the Purple GameBoy on the left and follow the path to the Pink GameBoy. Once you're in the Syxtenbit Caves, head down the ladder to the right. Grab the Black Prism across the ice and proceed. Chase Isha through this area, grabbing the *Razor Fang*, *Black Prism*, and *NeverMeltIce* along the way. An *Ice Heal* can be found in the maze to the left of Zubat.

!enc(521, ["Surfing", "Fishing"])

Continue pursuing Isha to the right. You can interact with **Sneasel (Hisuian)** on the right side! You can exit to the volcano area in the top right corner to catch more Cyndaquil, if you wish.

Isha is in the cave in the middle of the water down in Syxtenbit Cave, but we will confront him a bit later on. Head to the bottom left corner, where you'll see a *Black Prism*.

Nearby you'll see a ladder. Smash the rocks out of the way, push the boulder aside, and climb the ladder. Exit the cave, then immediately reenter the cave and climb back down the ladder. Push the boulder down a few times and it will fill a gap to the right, so you can get the *Groundium-Z*! Now head back up the ladder and exit for real.

We can surf in this outside area to reach new parts of the Atebit Kingdom. Surf to the right to reach the section we previously accessed via the library: a Larvitar can be caught at the top.

Surf down and left. West of "The Lighthouse" you'll be able to land on a blue dock. West of this, you can land in "Trunkleaf City".

If we had answered all of Eizen's Rivers' End questions correctly, he will offer us a game here, to relive the fight between Allen and Bladestar. Similarly to the fight with Amanda, we simply need to choose the attack that corresponds with whatever prompt our enemy says. After winning, you'll get the **??? Memory**.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If Eizen is in Trunkleaf City, win his game (+5 Alice, +5 Allen)

**ZCell 138: Atebit Kingdom**

!img("zcell138.png")

Make your way back down to the bottom of the Syxtenbit Cave when you are ready to fight Isha, and head in.

If you freed Giratina earlier:

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,0], "Glitch Field")

If you didn't free Giratina earlier, well....

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,1], "Glitch Field")

After defeating him, you'll be ejected from this area and returned to GDC.

While we're in GDC, one new thing to obtain is available: if Florin is still alive (by not taking the Berserk Florin route), head to the Treasure Treehouse. You'll find Talon here, who will task you with checking out a new area of Tyluric Temple. We have already explored this area: you can breed the Togepi (well, once you evolve it to **Togetic**) for a trade. Talon will next propose a trade, but talk to him a second time carefully, thanks to the maybe-maybe-not-intentional way this is coded:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Agree to Talon's Togepi trade *the first time he asks* (+2 Talon)

Anyways, he'll give you **Bagon**, holding the *Butterfreenite*!

One more thing to grab. Annoyingly out of the way this may be, make the way all the way back to the room in the Syxtenbit Cave where we fought Isha and grab the *Laprasite*!

## League Administration

Fly over to Sashila and talk to the group at the top. Head up in Alamissa Urben when you are ready.

!newself(["Alexandra",:ELITE_ALEXANDRA,0])

!partner(["Damien",:LEADER_DAMIEN,0])

!boss("STORMNINE", "Desert Field")

This fight shouldn't be too bad for Alexandra and Damien, thankfully.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Count me in! (Melia +3, Aelita +3, Ren +3, Venam +2, Alexandra +6)
- I'm scared... (Ren +2, Aelita +2, Erin +2, Damien +2)
- What are we talking about? (Erin -3, Melia -3, Ren -3, Aelita -5, Damien -6, Alexandra -6, Allen +3)

Me too Allen, me too.

Enter Alexandra's secret passageway and enter at the top.

### Day 01: Vs. Melia

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You mean Marianette? (Venam +2)
- My third badge? (Neutral)
- What? (Neutral)

Afterwards, prepare yourself for a battle with Melia!

!battle(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,0], "Fairy Tale Field")

!move("GILDEDHELIX")

The field effect is unalterable by moves, a broken seed effect that gives Aegislash one and Mimikyu TWO free turns turn to reach +4/+6 attack, all fire moves given an added Dragon typing hence can't touch Togekiss, Mimikyu or Azumarill and are now neutral against Aegislash: it's very stacked against you! Plus, her Zoroark has a crest that allows it to use Aegislash's Stance Change ability... so be careful of that.

The good news is that you are given a couple options to make this fight work in your favor. For one, Steel moves also get a 1.5x boost and hit dragons super effectively, so they hit half of her team hard; Bullet Punch is a savior here. Normal types are immune to Aegislash and Mimikyu's Ghost Attacks, so since they are not the fastest in the world a speedy normal type capable of knocking them out in one attack (after Disguise) might be the way to go. The Magical Seed "buys you time" to set up a sweeper, so I recommend using a couple of those if you're really stuck here.

To win, you'll receive the *Fate Badge*!

Outside, talk to Melia again.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Jenner was your father. (Melia +3)
- That's kinda cool! (Melia -3)

Tell Alexandra you're ready for training.

### Day 08: MC's Training

Talk to Ren in the hallway.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to her next time (Ren +2)
- You need some work... (Neutral)

Enter the battle room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm pumped. (Erin +2, Damien +2)
- I'm excited, I guess... (Erin +1)
- Eh... (Erin -1, Damien -2)

You'll be temporarily given a new team including Manectric, Swampert, and Walrein.

!battle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM3,2])

The strategy that worked for me was: Switch Manectric for Walrein, Waterfall on Houndoom turn 1. Then turn 2 was Blizzard with Walrein and Waterfall on Dugtrio, turn 3 was mega +
discharge, waterfall on Dugtrio, then turn 4 was discharge + high horsepower to finish off Kingler.

### Day 11: Aelita's Return

Head in to talk to Aelita.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- ...The statues? (Aelita +2)
- The Soul Stone (Aelita +1)
- I have no idea... (Aelita -1)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I don't remember... (Neutral)
- It couldn't have been me... (Neutral)
- ... (Damien -2)

Interact with the obelisk! Inside it's straightforward. You'll get the *Interceptor's Wish*!

### Day 15: Melia Vs. Erin

Back in the league administration you'll be thrusted into a 1v1 battle as Melia. Win or lose, it doesn't matter.

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,4])

!battle(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL2,0], "Chess Board")

### Day 18: MC's Day of Training, Pt. 2

Talk to Aelita in the hallway.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You'll be the Sensei too! (Aelita +3)
- What about GDC? (Aelita -1)

Next is a fight with Ren, one that will pit you against Ren. Pick a team between the three.

!battle(["Ren",:OUTCAST,5], "Dragon's Den")

Sleep for the night in the leftmost room.

### Day 29: Graduation

Finally, we get to obtain the *Mega-Z Ring*! This allows us to use Z-Moves as well as Mega Evolve our Pokemon!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Thank you, everyone! (Melia +2, Ren +2, Aelita +3, Damien
+1, Alexandra +3, Erin +1)
- I can't believe it... (Melia +1, Aelita +2, Ren +1, Erin
+1)
- Cool... I guess. (Aelita -1, Melia -1, Alexandra -2, Erin
-1, Venam -1, Ren -1, Allen +5, Alice +5)

Gosh, Allen and Alice are so cool.

Return to League Administration. Enter the bottom room and go right.

## Diamond Route

Select Path 1: the Diamond Route.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Erin at the Magnolia Library way earlier in the game (+2 Erin)

On the boat, choose whether you'll activate Interceptor's Wish. If you do, Erin will be using *your team*, whereas if you don't, she uses hers. I prefer not to activate Interceptor's Wish.

!newself(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL,5])

Follow the underwater path. Inside the manor, avoid the Regice, as you'll have to fight them. Make your way through the path here, watch the scene in the courtyard, then head onto the roof.

Follow the path to the right, then talk to Angie on the rooftop. Enter the left door.

!battle(["Ada",:SERVANT,0])

Take the left door on the higher floor.

!battle(["Berenice",:SERVANT,0])

!battle(["Havilah",:SERVANT,0])

!battle(["Hagith",:SERVANT,0])

Head back east to return to the rooftop, this time following the path right through the dance room!

Enter the window to the baby's room, then follow the path down the stairs. 

!battle(["Hannah",:SERVANT,0])

Try to exit the bottom door in the next room. After a conversation with Kanon return to the rooftop. Head back out the window at the bottom, then drop down the first spot on the roof you can from the right.

Inside, get the *Dungeon Key*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to the book in Anju's office (Erin +4, Kanon +4)

After exiting the office on top, go left, down, across the outside area, left through the lower level left door, then left, up, and left into the Ballroom.

!battle(["Erin & Kanon",:ICESOLDIERS,0])

Nothing too bad: Blizzard from Ampharos can take care of Salamence and Florges can take Absol.

Get the *Dungeon Key* up at the top of this room, then make your way back to the big hub room and use it to enter the courtyard.

Step on the red tile. 

!battle(["Hosanna",:SERVANT,0])

!battle(["Helah",:SERVANT,0])

Enter the ship and head downstairs. Then, talk to Patty in the nearby room and beat the maid. 

!battle(["Bebé",:SERVANT,0])

Next, reenter the cellar and defeat the maid looking at a wall towards the east side. 

!battle(["Malla",:SERVANT,0])

Return to Bonita, then head upstairs to get another *Dungeon Key*.

Enter the locked door in the cellars to get another *Dungeon Key*. After you see all of the scenes here, back in the dungeon, exit to the left. Back in the courtyard, head to the top door to confront Angie.

!dbattle(["Cera",:FAITHFUL,2], ["Angie",:LEADER_ANGIE2,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

This one can be tough, but not as bad as our first encounter with Angie. Erin's Aevian Ampharos is good here, able to survive a decent chunk of the ice attacks and then hit really hard in return. I would recommend starting with something fast like Zangoose on the left side and Ampharos on the right, then focus all your attacks on Angie's Pokemon (Mamoswine, Beartic, Walrein) to start. Once you knock them out, dealing with Cera's three is much easier.

That's it for the Diamond Route!

## Pearl Route

Again, you'll be given the choice to activate the Interceptor's wish. I choose not to for this guide.

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,3])

As Melia, take a stroll around the town. Head into the mart, then defeat Sariah.

!battle(["Sariah",:GHOSTGIRL,2])

In the grove, talk to the Arceus statue. Head down and prepare for a battle. You get to pick whether Ren or Venam is your partner, or you can do it alone.

!partner(["Ren",:OUTCAST,4])

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM3,1])

!battle(["Lorna",:ROGPSYCHIC,1], "Blessed Field")

In the 3rd Layer, head up. You'll have to defeat a couple more mechs!

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,6], "Crystal Cavern")

Go to the right and find the open building. Explore upstairs then head out. We're looking for three green rods: one is hidden up and to the right, another is up from where we found Ren, and the other is near where we started. Reactivate the generator.

Prepare to fight a mech Gyarados with Ren!

!boss("MECHAGYARADOS", "Crystal Cavern")

Afterwards, return to the building and head upstairs. Head back out and go up when you're ready.

!battle(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,5], "Crystal Cavern")

A lot of smart switching will make this fight a breeze for Melia.

Head up and into this building.

!battle(["Terasita",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

!battle(["Eddie",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

!battle(["Rashida",:XENANALYST_F,0])

!battle(["Harrold",:XENANALYST_M,0])

When you reach the gatling gun, spam the up arrow. 

!partner(["Lorna",:ROGPSYCHIC,1])

Defeat the wild Claydol mechs.

!battle(["Marco",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

Enter the door on the right outside after grabbing the shining key. Read each letter in each open room and open the next door. Finally, enter the last door in this area and go up. Make your way through and watch the scenes, and when you're able, exit back to Ren and Venam. Take the elevator up, then the second elevator to the Den of Souls. After a scene, head up.

!battle(["Cassandra",:XENADMIN_1,0], "Blessed Field")

This is a tough battle as Cassandra has a lot of threats, and if you're playing as Melia's team, well, then Serperior, Cinccino and Lycanroc can outspeed your entire team. As such you need to leverage your team correctly - for instance, Togekiss can easily dispatch the Shadow Bisharp and Serperior, while Meganium can tank Cinccino and chip Mega Mawile well. Aevian Milotic will go down to a couple of Earthquakes from Mega Snorlax, and Mimikyu is a good backup revenge killer or late-fight sweeper.

That's it for the Pearl Route!

## Axis High University

With both of those completed, you'll be in control of your character again. Choose path 3 and be given the *Rotom Phone*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I had an idea... (Aelita +2)
- Nope! (Aelita +1)
- School sucks. (Aelita -1)

Head up and into the school.

!shop("Axis High Shop", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Ultra Potion", "Max Repel"])

Walk down the stairs on the left.

**ZCell 139: Axis High University**

!img("zcell139.png")

Then, head upstairs in the middle, and talk to Huey.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- That's right! (Lavender +2, Huey +2)
- Uh.... (Lavender -2)
- Not really, no. (Huey -3, Lavender -4)
- Where's Reina? (Neutral)

In a room at the bottom is the... bobsled club? 

!battle(["Kayla",:GUITARIST,0])

!battle(["Dark",:AXISSTUDENT_FW,0])

!battle(["Will",:CHARMER,0])

!battle(["Squill",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

!battle(["Dylan",:CAMPER,0])

!battle(["Tim",:COOLTRAINER_M,0])

!battle(["Jared",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

!battle(["Matty",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

!battle(["Jeremiah",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

If you can defeat all the students, you'll be gifted the MegaStone *Cameruptite*!

In another room on this floor you'll find:

**ZCell 140: Axis High University**

!img("zcell140.png")

Head back downstairs, where you'll find Amber! You'll be given *Concert Tickets* and *Amber's Letter*! Talk to Saki in the cafeteria to the right. Then, find Aelita upstairs, east of the Bobsled Club.

Time for a 2v2 battle with Risa Raider downstairs, victory as usual being optional.

!battle(["Risa Raider",:POPSTAR,2])

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I trust you! (Amber +6, Aelita +3)
- Uh... (Amber -2, Aelita -1)

Interact with the fountain next, then head to the dorms downstairs to sleep. The next day, head to the auditorium for the announcement!

## Nightmare School: Aelita

I will begin with Path 1. Once more you'll be given a choice to activate the Interceptor's Wish, I declined.

!newself(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,5])

Head outside. Enter this classroom to the left and use the 'A' key to do a group investigation in here. Back outside, go right.

!battle(["Brigette",:AXISSTUDENT_FW,0])

You'll find that Zetta is running the shop:

!shop("Nightmare University Shop", ["Super Potion", "Full Heal", "Ultra Potion"])

!battle(["Naomi",:AXISSTUDENT_FB,0])

Do a group investigation on the three entryway areas if you'd like, then head to the left area to give the Masked Men the password: "Sorry".

Downstairs, talk to Ms. Erable, then to the student on the right with the "!" over his head. Say no, then you'll battle. 

!battle(["Zachary",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

Then say yes to the person on the left and return to Ms. Erable.

!battle(["Jean",:AXISSTUDENT_MB,0])

Take advantage of Granbull and Staraptor's Intimidates, then hit it hard with your strongest moves.

After all that, find the fifth door from the bottom on the third story, right side and enter "Dreamyard". Enter Huey's door!

!newself(["Huey",:OPTKID,2])

Talk to the Rapidash rider then the girl in the bottom corner. Press the red panel here, then in the next area, follow the stairs to the next panel. The third panel is in the bottom left corner. 

!battle(["???",:MYSTSTUDENT,0])

Head to the right and fight her again at the bottom. Follow the path to finish Huey's area.

Head outside and enter the pyramid. At the top left talk to the girl and agree to help. Then go left and across the bridge to make friends with Grigus. 

!battle(["Huey",:OPTKID,2], "Desert Field")

Battle Huey, but intentionally lose to progress. You'll be awarded 10 *Phantom Candy S*!

Pick a partner or choose to go alone.

!partner(["Huey",:OPTKID,2])

!partner(["Lavender",:LEADER_LAVENDER,1])

!boss("COFFEEGREGUS", "Desert Field")

Pick up the piece of the treasure afterwards! Head back into the main room, you'll find the invisible person near the bottom, on a tile containing part of a barrel. 

!battle(["Tucker",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0], "Desert Field")

Talk to the girl at the top then enter this new room at the bottom.

Grab the thing in the middle and head back to the main room to reassemble the bridge. Enter Aelita's door!

Talk to both pink bookshelves then the pink plant. Then follow cyborg Deagan! Talk to each nurse from behind, then head out once Deagan touches the sunflower.

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,3], "Factory Field")

Easy enough for Aelita's team!

Once this part finishes up, interact with the box outside. Time for another battle!

!battle(["???",:MASKEDMAN,2], "Desert Field")

Return to the auditorium. Reenter the Pyramid area where we fought Coffee Grigus, then return to the auditorium once more. Go up here, then follow the path to Lavender's door.

!newself(["Lavender",:LEADER_LAVENDER,2])

Enter the moon base and grab the crimson quartz in the upper room then heat it below. Head out... and we must run away from Risa! Don't let yourself get hit too many times. Maneuver your way through the path, hitting switches as you go.

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

In the bottom right corner, press the green switch but hop down to the left of the blue switch.

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,1], "Factory Field")

Press the last green switch then back into the hallway and go up. Get the thing here then push the button and head down and to the right.

Grapple to the right and then do so again. 

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,2], "Factory Field")

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,3], "Factory Field")

Follow the path to the yellow switch in here, then in the previous room head down. 

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,1], "Factory Field")

Follow the path here to the green switch then backtrack and go up. 

!battle(["Risa",:POPSTAR,3], "Starlight Arena")

Prioritizing defeating the physical attackers first should set up a nigh-unkillable Noctowl for the win.

Up in the next room try to escape, then interact with the panel. Now we have a real team for a real fight!

!newself(["Lavender",:LEADER_LAVENDER,3])

!boss("BOSSRESHIRAM", "Starlight Arena")

Reshiram one shots every one of your Pokemon, but you should be able to deal enough damage after putting it to sleep to emerge victorious. Save the slower Pokemon for the sleep turns and let the faster Pokemon trade damage when it is awake. 

That's it for this part!

## Nightmare School: MC

Exit the auditorium and talk to the student here who has lost his brain. SEC is the storekeeper here and has the same items as Zetta did. Do a group investigation of the cafeteria here. Return to the guy to get *Mysterious Black Box* and *3 Phantom Candy S*. 

!battle(["Moodi",:AXISSTUDENT_FW,0])

Winning grants *3 Phantom Candy S*.

Talk to the masked man to the right, and you'll be given a clue. Enter the classroom and do a group investigation. Return and try entering "ants troubled" if you like. The actual answer is "student labor." Head down the stairs.

Enter a room on the left and say you don't want to battle to battle someone. 

!battle(["Ambarlinn",:AXISSTUDENT_FW,0], "Factory Field")

Win to get *3 Phantom Candy S* and another *Mysterious Black Box*. In the top left room answer the bottom answer, and you'll get *Phantom Candy M* and another *Mysterious Black Box*. 

Try to enter the machine in the lower area of the main room. Talk to it again. You'll need to generate different students based on their attributes, the chalkboards in the lower left classroom are the guide. So, make the following:

- Student 1: Determined, Math, Medical Proficiency, Internship Experience
- Student 2: Studious, English, Drama Proficiency, 10 or more performances
- Student 3: Whimsical, Botany, Botanical Proficiency, Hugged a Tree.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Give her space. (Saki +2)
- She has amnesia. (Saki +1, Amber +1)
- ... (Saki -2)

Build one more:

- Student 4: Studious, Engineering, Engineering Proficiency, 3 Years' Experience

Talk to the door at the top.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Of course (Amber +2, Saki +2)
- Um... I'm scared! (Saki -2, Amber -2)

!battle(["Zetta",:XENEXECUTIVE_1,11], "Factory Field")

This one is somewhat tough but luckily not as bad as Mt. Valor! You'll need to watch out for Absol, who critical hits frequently thanks to its ability and item. The Typhlosion, Dragonite, Weavile, Minior we've all seen before and know how to deal with by now. Watch out for Hitmonlee who will get an Unburden boost after using Fake Out.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You got this Amber! (Amber +3)
- Good luck. (Amber +2)
- ... (Amber -2)

You can activate Interceptor's Wish if you want to.

!newself(["Amber",:LEADER_AMBER2,0])

Inside, complete the first few tasks just as we did as Aelita. Once you reach the room Amber cannot enter, go right.

!battle(["Howard",:SCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

!battle(["Demitri",:SCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

 Beat the scientists in here then pick up the key and unlock the left door. Go down the elevator, into the door, and get the key. Use it back up from the elevator. Pick up the final key and reenter the main hallway.

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,3], "Factory Field")

A bit harder since you only have three this time, but nonetheless very doable.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm happy for you! (Amber +2)
- ... (Amber -1)

Make your way all the way back to the auditorium as soon as you are prompted to. Some students will battle you in the factory.

!battle(["Denzil",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

You'll get *3 Phantom Candy M*. Return to the auditorium

!battle(["???",:MASKEDMAN,0])

Again, probably easy for your team at this point.

Head upstairs. Interact with a terminal on the right. Your goal is to get the red box into the green space. 

- Top Right Solution: LURURULDRULULD
- Bottom Right Solution: DRURULUDRULDRURDLDRURDR
- Middle Bottom Solution: DLULURURULDL
- Top Left Solution: URURULDRDLDR

After you finish, talk to the main table thing, then go around the room bashing suspicious walls. That is, any that don't fit in with what's around them. Then return to the table.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you doing okay? (Amber +2)
- What happened? (Neutral)
- You done? (Saki -2, Amber -2)

Then head upstairs and enter your building on the left. Answer however you like.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- What? (Neutral)
- Yes. (Saki -2)

Return to the underground to the broken machine in the upper left room. It's time for a great sequence. Destroy all the robots you can find, eventually making your way to the third floor. Bust your way through the panels.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- My body screams for more. (Saki +5, Amber +3)
- It was awesome! (Saki +3, Amber +2)
- It was... interesting. (Amber +1)
- Eh. (Amber -2, Saki -3)

Take the teleporter then go up.

!battle(["???",:MASKEDMAN,1])

A fast fire move will do the trick here.

Head back to the teleporter and talk to the Saki door.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Kick ass, Saki! (Saki +3)
- Uh... Good luck? (Neutral)

Put the mannequins into pods... yikes.

Head up and interact with the monitor thing. Then go up and talk to the box thing. Then input 7496 into the monitor. Talk to Amber then push the red switch at the bottom and go down the newly opened stairs.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It did. (Neutral)
- I don't know. (Neutral)
- I'm hungry. (Saki +2)

Then when you return head out and go down the lift.

After learning about all this, it's finally time to enter the player's door!

### Paragon and Renegade Routes

Some events in the story thus far have resulted in branching story paths to some extent, but the general arc of the story has remained the same. It is at this point that the story's largest split occurs: the default route is called the **Paragon Route**... while a different, more difficult to attain route exists called the **Renegade Route**. Their names imply their true nature as to what side you'll be fighting for, going forward.

To get to Renegade Route, you'll need to end up with at least 100 of what I have called so far "Renegade Points" (RP). In addition to the points we may have due to story choices thus far, the following calculations are also done:

Current Karma (by my calculations, current maximum is 59) is:
- 54 or more: 0 RP added
- 45 thru 54: 5 RP added
- 35 thru 44: 10 RP added
- 25 thru 34: 15 RP added
- 10 thru 24: 20 RP added
- 0 thru 9: 25 RP added
- -10 thru -1: 45 RP added
- -20 or less: 75 RP added

Plus, you'll get RP corresponding to current Relationship Point Values.
- Less than 0 points with Melia, Venam, Ren, Aelita, Erin, Amber: +5 RP respectively
- Less than 0 points with Tesla: +20 RP

Adding up all the RP and comparing it to 100 will determine whether or not you can access the Renegade Route. If you can, follow the path left through the negative space area in your Nightmare Realm...

For both routes, you'll need to confront, well, yourself.

!battle(["Ana",:TRAINER_ANA,1], "Snowy Mountain Field")

!battle(["Aevis",:TRAINER_AEVIS,0], "Snowy Mountain Field")

!battle(["Aevia",:TRAINER_AEVIA,0], "Snowy Mountain Field")

!battle(["Ariana",:TRAINER_ARIA,0], "Snowy Mountain Field")

!battle(["Axel",:TRAINER_AXEL,0], "Snowy Mountain Field")

!battle(["Alain",:TRAINER_ALAIN,0], "Snowy Mountain Field")

!battle(["Aero",:TRAINER_AERO,0], "Snowy Mountain Field")

You can beat yourself, right?

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Don't let her get to you. (Aelita +4)
- It's alright. (Aelita +2)
- Watch what you say. (Aelita -2)

After all that, you'll wake up from the Nightmare School!

## Hidden Axis Lab

Go upstairs and enter the stairs at the fountain. Follow the path to fight SEC again!

!battle(["SEC",:SECURITYSYSTEM,5], "Factory Field")

Get the Fire Stone in the next room.

!battle(["SEC",:SECURITYSYSTEM,7], "Factory Field")

Go left instead of up in the next room. Down from here, you'll be able to grab a *Nightmare Fuel*.

**ZCell 141: Hidden Axis Lab**

!img("zcell141.png")

Head up - it's time to fight illusions. You get relationship points depending on if you're right.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Choose the correct Erick (+6 Erick)
- Choose the incorrect Erick (-4 Erick)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Choose the correct Aelita (Neutral)
- Choose the incorrect Aelita (-4 Aelita)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If you chose the wrong Aelita: I'm sorry... (Aelita +1)
- If you chose the wrong Aelita: Could've been more clear! (Aelita -2)

Anyways, time for a battle!

!battle(["Clear",:UNKNOWN_2,0], "Factory Field")

The Naganadel has two shields, and her Stantler and Beheeyem have crests that make each much better. That said, if you don't let Naganadel get too many Beast Boosts, her team is slow overall and you can sweep them with the right Pokemon. That said, winning this one is optional.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Fail to defeat Clear (-1 Aelita, -1 Adam, -1 Braixen, -1 Erick)

Back outside:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm going too! (Aelita +3)
- I hate this. (Erick +3)
- Uh... on second thought... (Aelita -2)

Head back up to Axis High.

!enc(57)

Make your way to the left here as you fight puppet masters.

!battle(["Magenta",:LEADER_PUPPET1,1], "Starlight Arena")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Whoey? (Lavender +1)
- Sorry... (Neutral)

!battle(["Neon",:LEADER_PUPPET2,1], "Starlight Arena")

!battle(["Magenta",:LEADER_PUPPET1,2], "Starlight Arena")

!battle(["Magenta",:LEADER_PUPPET1,3], "Starlight Arena")

After the scenes at the top, head down and to the right. Pick up another *Nightmare Fuel* as you go.

!battle(["Neon",:LEADER_PUPPET2,2], "Starlight Arena")

!battle(["Neon",:LEADER_PUPPET2,3], "Starlight Arena")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Kinda Cool! (Amber +1)
- Super Cool! (Amber +2)
- Mega Cool! (Amber +3)
- Eh... (Amber -1)

Return to take the teleporter.

!battle(["Hazuki",:ROGUEHERO,0], "Starlight Arena")

This battle has been made much easier since the previous version, though you still need to be careful. Mega Corviknight is very bulky and can set up Tailwind for its allies, while Mr. Rime is able to use Fake Out and deals decent damage. The somewhat slow but powerful trio of Sirfetch'd, Samruott, and Aegislash is in the back, ready to pick up one-shots if you don't get to them first. You also need to watch out for Aevian Chandelure, whose Illuminate ability will redirect single-target attacks to it on the first turn it is on the field.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm so sorry. (Saki +2, Aelita +2)
- It's going to be okay. (Neutral)
- She was lost. (Saki -1)
- That wasn't Hazuki. (Saki -2)

Head up and follow the path to obtain the *Intercept-Z*!

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,4])

!boss("MASTEROFNIGHTMARES", "Starlight Arena")

Equip the Intercept-Z to a Pokemon first. The Intercept-Z allows you to use one of multiple very strong effects to turn the tide of battle. The Puppet Master's multiple forms take you through different fields and different typings, though Aelita is fairly helpful against the Hand forms, so do what you can to support her. Once the second-to-last shield is broken, it reaches its strongest yet slowest form, meaning you can wear it down with Defense drops and go crazy dealing damage to it. It inflicts tons of status conditions over the course of the fight, so moves like Safeguard or items like Lum Berries may be useful.

!boss("MASTEROFNIGHTMARES2", "Starlight Arena")

Just gotta one shot it.

!battle(["Huey",:OPTKID,1], "Starlight Arena")

Huey is not too bad! Just make sure he doesn't get stupidly powerful with Octillery or Glalie's moody and you'll be fine.

After the lengthy story scene, we get to play as Saki for a bit. Interact with all the "..." points as well as Saki's parents, then pick up the phone in the upper left corner.

Back as the player, enter the first room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Why me? (Erin -1)
- I'm on it. (Erin +2)
- Goddamnit... (Melia -2, Aelita -2, Erin -3)

Accept the fast travel to Axis. Follow the path up. After this scene is over, head back out and down to Saki's gym!

## Axis Factory

Enter the door to the left.

!battle(["Gail",:AXISSTUDENT_FW,0])

!enc(111)

Make sure you catch an Aevian Litwick to show to Zumi.

Make your way through the path to the left. There is a sneakily hidden door at the bottom of the left-most side: follow it down. 

!battle(["Mac",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0], "Factory Field")

Make your way to the right and open a chest for 3 *Green Shards*. Step on all three of the yellow switches and make them blue to spawn a railcart. Jump in the railcart, step on the switch, and open the chest for 3 *Yellow Shards*.

Backtrack to the start of the area, then go down from where Sakitron was. In this next area, use the rail carts to go left. 

!battle(["Scott",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0], "Factory Field")

Step on the switch, then go right and down. Left at the fork:

!battle(["Ken",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "Factory Field")

Open the chest for *3 Exp. Candy XL*. To the right:

!battle(["Jacob",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0], "Factory Field")

And finally, go down:

!battle(["Michelle",:LASS,0], "Factory Field")

Take the minecart on the right to return to the top, where you can grab a *Dungeon Key*. Open the nearby door.

We can solve a puzzle with some statues here. Of the four that turn, turn the top-left one South, the top-right one West, the bottom-left one East, and the bottom-right one North. A chest containing an *Adamant Mint* will appear!

!dbattle(["Kyu",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0], ["Henry",:AXISSTUDENT_MB,0], "Factory Field")

Pick up the *Dungeon Key* and use it above.

!battle(["Geara",:XENEXECUTIVE_5,0], "Haunted Field")

Man, this guy keeps showing up and is never any less annoying. He generates his own Haunted Field, real funny. All his Pokemon hit really hard, and Clefable even comes with a synergistic Burn to prevent other status. Mega Gengar is insanely fast and with field boosted Shadow Ball can kill almost anything, Krookodile starts strong and can go on a Moxie rampage starting with its Z-move, Aevian Parasect's ability guarantees it a second life after you knock it out the first time, and on and on this fight's difficulties go.

Parasect and Clefable are the main Pokemon stopping a speedy/Trick Room sweeper, so consider Pokemon that can deal with those two for support. Your own ghost types can deal heavy damage here. Fire moves gain Ghost typing, so once you can knock out Chandelure, a Fire type may be able to go on a tear here.

Push the button and enter the teleporter. Go left then down and enter the newly opened door to get a *Master Key*.

Before we fight the gym leader though, there are some quests we can get done!

## Post Nightmare Quests

Fly over to East Gearen. Enter the Magnolia Library and show your Aevian Litwick to Zumi, who'll reward you with *30 Exp. Candy L* and the *Manectite*. That's the end of the *PictoZumi* quest!

Sadly, Ayuda next door is currently completely incapable of perceiving our 140+ Zygarde Cells, even though that is the amount he's currently looking for. Maybe in V14 we'll get our reward, Ayuda.

Next, make your way to the Den of Souls via the Goldenwood Silent Grove. Head up to pick up the *HP Up*. Follow the path to the city area and find a *Revive* on the left. Hidden here is also *Nugget*, *Damp Rock*, and *Red Shard*. Make your way to the 3rd HQ via the elevator and head to the 3rd floor. In the rooms with the notes, you can grab an *Antidote*, a *Full Heal*, and a *Revival Herb*. A room to the left has an *Elixir* in it. On the second floor, you can find a *Max Potion*.

Exit to the 3rd Layer. On the right is an *Ultra Potion*. Talk to the broken mech-Gyarados to the left. Inside, you'll get a *Dragon Memory*. Head up to get the *Glalitite*! Proceed left and pick up the *Tiny Mushroom*.

We can surf on the water here, actually!

!enc(395)

Surf down to the bottom area. You'll find Wild Omanyte here, and a hidden *Blue Shard*. To the right, you can get *TM89 U-Turn*. Further to the right, you'll find a hidden *Ether*. On the north side of the pond, you can find a hidden *Heart Scale*. 

On your way back to the 3rd HQ, surf to the left around the mech-Gyarados to find wild Kabuto and *TM82 Dragon Tail*! That's it for our exploration of this area, so make your way all the way back to the surface and return to Axis Factory.

## Forgery Badge

Head into the gym door at the top and get ready for quite a battle.

!battle(["Saki",:LEADER_SAKI2,0], "Factory Field")

!move("ULTRAMEGADEATH")

My love letter to the insane wackiness that was V13 Saki is unfortunately moot. No longer will you the player need to deal with Wonder Room Glitch Field shenanigans. The good news is though that this fight has been replaced by another very interesting one, though not quite as hard as the previous.

A fun gimmick with this fight is that Saki changes the field a whole bunch. It starts on Factory, but will change to Glitch Field after the first knock-out. She likes to send in Durant second onto the Glitch Field to activate its Synthetic Seed and make it typeless. Following this, you'll go through the City Field, never-before-seen Colosseum Field, and once more through the Factory Field until the field settles on City for what probably accounts for the rest of the fight. If you opt for stall or take too long, the field will eventually permanently switch to Colosseum for the remainer.

Her Pokemon have a decent spread of coverage moves, speed, priority, etc, but it shouldn't be a major difficulty spike at this point. If you find yourself taking heavy damage on any of the one-turn temporary fields, consider opting for Protect to skip ahead to the next. The City Field is a hard one to plan around for this fight: its only move boosts are to types that Steel resists anyways. Perhaps better is to switch the field to Back Alley, where you can boost moves like Sucker Punch to better deal with Mega Metagross! Otherwise, a healthy mix of Fire, Fighting, and Ground moves for offense with some priority will do the trick.

Win to get *TM91 Flash Cannon* as well as the Forgery Badge, which raises the Level Cap to Lv. 90!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Beat Saki while Saki Points >= 3 (+4 Saki, +4 Amber, +4 Venam)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Beat Saki while Amber Points >= 3 (+4 Amber, +4 Venam)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You got it, bro (Adam +3)
- Sure. (Adam +1)
- Really? Ugh... (Adam -3, Venam -2)

Next, return to Sashila, and enter the second room on the right to talk to Crescent.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- They're my friends. (Neutral)
- None of your business. (Crescent -4)

Then enter the leftmost room to talk to the group.

## 15 Badge Quests 

Before we get started on the new .Karma Files content for the Paragon Route and Renegade Route, there are a few sidequests we can take care of. First: head to Route 4: Cairo now has one more crest he'll sell us for 14K Red Essence!

!shop("Cairo’s Shop New Items (15 Badges)", [["Delcatty Crest", "14000 Red Essences"]])

Fly to Eclysia Pyramid and talk to Ryland on the summit. You'll get the *Steelixite*!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Ryland at Eclysia Skyview (+6 Ryland)

Make your way over to Axis High University. On the grounds in front of the school you'll see a green butterfly. Talk to it for a spirit battle.

!dbattle(["Xara",:SPIRITXARA,0], ["Jean",:SPIRITJEAN,0], "City Field")

This a very tough fight on a tough field. This is our first 12v6 in this game, and Spirit Xara and Jean pull no punches. They each have two Crest Pokemon, a Z-Move, and a Mega Evolution. Their Pokemon are all across the stat spectrum and all across the typing spectrum, so there's not really one particular strategy that works here. The Delcatty literally gets +110% to each stat thanks to its Crest on the first turn... imagine my surprise figuring out how to finally take Delcatty out only to realize there were 11 more Pokemon waiting to take me on.

One piece of good news is that there are only a few spread moves, so using Protect to counter the AI can help you get momentum. You really want to focus on crippling or taking out Delcatty first, then focusing on the rest of the team later on. Dragapult's screens are very annoying - if you can get rid of those and get a Pokemon some SpA boosts and let it spam Hyper Voice or Blizzard, you are generally going to be set with the right allies to support.

Win this very difficult battle to get *5 Blue Shards*, *5 Red Shards*, *5 Green Shards*, *5 Black Prisms*, *5 Exp. Candy XL*, as well as the *Copperajite* and *Beedrillite*!
