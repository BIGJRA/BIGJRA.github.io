# Chapter 15: Vague Clarity

We will be taken to Sashila Village. Before continuing the story, a whole bunch of quests are open to us now that we have defeated Ryland.

## Zone Zero Quests

Take a Braviary over to the Pyramid Outskirts and go up. 

!enc(606)

Surf to the left side and the right side of the pyramid to get *Ground Memory* and *TM28 Dig*. Could've been useful 15 minutes ago! You can also give a treat to **Riolu** for a battle.

Next, enter the Eclysia Skyview, then make your way down the lift. Once you use a teleporter, head left and surf up and across. Pick up the *Magic Wand* here, then exit the pyramid.

Make your way to the south side of Zone Zero. You'll see two open doors to the same apartment building. Enter the one on the right first.

!battle(["Venus",:CHALLENGER,0], "Big Top Arena")

These mad lad developers did it - they made Ledian decent! It's punching moves hit 4 times, meaning it's gonna do lots of damage with coverage and priority options. The rest of Venus's team is effective too, though almost entirely because of the team's synergy with the field.

Reborn players should be used to this field by now, but here are some strategies that tend to work on this field. Revelation/Petal/Fiery Dance are all boosted under this field, so a team using these that targets their low special defense might succeed. Dragon/Swords/Quiver Dance also boost stats even more, so a sweeper might see success here if they can get the opportunity to set up. Acrobatics also is boosted here and can help you get rid of Ledian, Rillaboom, and Centiskorch.

Succeed to nab the third *Star Shard*, as well as the *Ledian Crest*, and a *Somnium Mall Stamp*.

Outside, enter the building to the left. Go up and climb down the ladder to reach the area where we were ambushed by Bladestar.

**ZCell 134: Apartment Depths**

!img("zcell134.png")

Head up after grabbing this cell to get an *Ability Capsule*! Then, head left and follow the path all the way to the left to grab the shiny Lux Apartment keys. Exit the building and go straight to the right. Enter the tall apartment building with the key.

We have to complete a puzzle similar to Generation III's Abandoned Ship backrooms.

- Enter 1A. Interact with the upper right sparkle, one tile left from the top right.
- Enter 1F. Interact with the upper left tile on the table.
- Enter 1E to study the sparkles.
- Enter 1D. Interact with the rightmost tile of the bed.
- Enter 2F (upstairs) to study the sparkles.
- Enter 2E. Interact with In the bottom tile of the bed in the 2F side.
- Enter 2C. Exit via the 2B door.
- Enter 1B. Interact with the tile two above the right rock. Exit left.
- Enter 2D. Interact with the center tile to get the final key. Plus:

**ZCell 135: Lux Apartments**

!img("zcell135.png")

- Enter 2C and exit via the 2B door again.
- Enter 1C. Go down the ladder, click the lever in this area, and pick up *Rocky Helmet*.

To the left from the Zone Zero Pokemon Center on the northern map, you'll find that a gate has opened, leading you to be able to catch **Gible**, plus:

**ZCell 136: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell136.png")

Fly over to Kakori Village. Enter a house on the left side and present the *Magic Wand* to get **Fennekin**!

We now have access to Grand Dream City once more, and there are a few things we can take care of. First, enter Scholar District and enter the Fan Club. For beating Adam we should now have enough reputation that when we walk in, we will get a *Somnium Mall Stamp* as well as the *Aerodactylite*! Talk to a girl to get the *Poisonium-Z* as well!

Head west to the Festival Plaza. There is a new tutor on the left.

!tutor("Festival Plaza North Tutor", [["Superpower", "6 Yellow Shards"], ["Heat Wave", "6 Blue Shards"], ["Stealth Rock", "6 Red Shards"], ["Future Sight", "4 Red Shards"], ["Flip Turn", "5 Green Shards"]])

One more quest in the desert area: make your way to the southeast corner of the Zorrialyn Desert by Poiloethal Forest to begin the *Poisonous Luck* quest. Follow Jangmo'o to Luck's Tent in Zorrialyn Coast. Inside, you'll be able to purchase **Jangmo'o (Aevian)** in exchange for 13 Black Prisms!

Take the time to breed Aevian Jangmo'o and take the spare to a house in Zorrialyn Desert East. We can trade it for **Jangmo'o** (the Alolan kind)!

## Narcissa's Hauntings Conclusion

If you've progressed Narcissa's Hauntings so far, you can now continue this quest.

Fly to the Rose Theater, and enter Forlorned Cavern on Route 9. Enter the first room in the main area of the cave, with the Timesplicer Stone. After a scene with Narcissa, accept the fast travel to the Cliffside Grave if you've been already -- if not, [you'll need to explore Amethyst Cave](#amethyst-depths). Talk to her again, then accept fast travel to Phasial Cave.

Head up and watch the scenes play out. Then, in Narcissa's house, talk to her upstairs. Head out and go to the Wispy Tower. Talk to young Narcy here and go in. Enter the lab, and head left. Talk to her again. Enter the western room, and surf up. Watch the CD Rom, then return to Narcissa's house and talk to them again. Accept fast travel.

Follow the Rotom into the cave, then take the time crystal to the past. Interact with the safe here. Then, pull the lever in the top left corner, hiding in boxes. Go down the ladder and out. You can find hidden *Revival Herb*, *Full Heal*, *Health Wing*, and *Blue Shard* throughout the building. Unlock the gate, and head in.

After a scene, talk to Narcissa and agree to go. Enter the manor and head upstairs to the top left room. Talk to the safe after another scene for the *Fairy Memory* and *Shiinotic Crest*. Exit to the well in the backyard.

Grab the *Code Rembrence Rift Notes* and head up.

!partner(["Narcissa",:LEADER_NARCISSA,1])

!boss("DUFAUX", "Bewitched Field")

Dufaux is a difficult boss. Each phase of the fight adds something to Dufaux until it becomes a speedy spread move sweeper, so you have to do what you can to prevent this from happening. Narcissa is a very solid ally with supporting moves: using moves like Wide Guard and Protect to buy her time will help. Trick Room notably makes the final phases easier.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Finish Narcissa's Hauntings (+6 Narcissa)

Head to the Lost Castle. All the way at the top, you'll get a chance to battle **Rotom**!

Fly to West Gearen and go talk to Gabriel at the West Gearen power plant. Follow him left, up, and up to get access to a room where you can change Rotom's form! You'll also get another *Somnium Mall Stamp*!

## Missing Children 2

If you've completed all the steps of the *Missing Children* quest with Ana and Dylan so far, make your way to GDC. Make your way to the underground and enter Dylan's house.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sorry...! (+2 Particia, +2 Dylan)
- Yeah, that's my bad. (Neutral)
- I don't need to call. (-2 Particia, -3 Dylan)

Accept the fast travel request. Talk to Sienna in the mortuary, then head to the Pokemon Pinnacle to the left. Make your way to the top of the dungeon.

If you defeated Ana earlier:

!newself(["Ana",:NANO,1])

If you let Ana win:

!newself(["Ana",:NANO,2])

!dbattle(["Misa",:BLADESTAR_F,0], ["Peter",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Haunted Field")

At Pokestar Studios, talk to Ana on the right. Follow her to the left again and let the scenes play out. Back in the Underground, proceed left past Dylan's house.

!battle(["Nicole",:LADY,0], "Back Alley")

!battle( ["Rojin",:WORKERF,0], "Back Alley")

!battle(["Kurt",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "Back Alley")

You'll be taken to Dylan's Kristiline Town house. Head outside, then follow Ana to the Sapphire Museum. Follow her next to the Lava Cookie restaurant. After that conversation, go back to Dylan's and talk to her there. Talk to her once more to the left of the Pokemon Center.

Fly to Teila Resort and head to Route 5. The easiest way to reach the Secluded Shore is to dive down on the east side of Route 5, then surface just above the entrance to the Secluded Shore. You'll get 5 *Lava Cookies*!

Back in Kristiline, fly to Teila Resort and talk to Ana in the middle. Gather intel from the townspeople then talk to her again. We don't need to win the challenge, but if you'd like to, choose these options from her questions: first, fourth, second. Then talk to Gigiorno in the middle to get it started.

Back in Kristiline again, enter the house. That's all we can do in this quest for now!

## Atebit Doctor Quest

Make your way once more to the Eclysia Pyramid. Up the stairs on the right, you'll be able to enter a rift to return to the area with all the "GameBoys". Walk into the first to talk to Talon, beginning the *Atebit Doctor* quest.

Take the Purple GameBoy on the left and follow the path to the Pink GameBoy. Once you're in the Syxtenbit Caves, head down the ladder to the right. Grab the Black Prism across the ice and proceed. Chase Isha through this area, grabbing the *Razor Fang*, *Black Prism*, and *NeverMeltIce* along the way. An *Ice Heal* can be found in the maze to the left of Zubat.

!enc(521, ["Surfing", "Fishing"])

Continue pursuing Isha to the right. You can interact with **Sneasel (Hisuian)** on the right side! You can exit to the volcano area in the top right corner to catch more Cyndaquil, if you wish.

Isha is in the cave in the middle of the water down in Syxtenbit Cave, but we will confront him a bit later on. Head to the bottom left corner, where you'll see a *Black Prism*.

Nearby you'll see a ladder. Smash the rocks out of the way, push the boulder aside, and climb the ladder. Exit the cave, then immediately reenter the cave and climb back down the ladder. Push the boulder down a few times and it will fill a gap to the right, so you can get the *Groundium-Z*! Now head back up the ladder and exit for real.

We can surf in this outside area to reach new parts of the Atebit Kingdom. Surf to the right to reach the section we previously accessed via the library: a Larvitar can be caught at the top.

Surf down and left. West of "The Lighthouse" you'll be able to land on a blue dock. West of this, you can land in "Trunkleaf City".

If we had answered all of Eizen's Rivers' End questions correctly, he will offer us a game here, to relive the fight between Allen and Bladestar. Similarly to the fight with Amanda, we simply need to choose the attack that corresponds with whatever prompt our enemy says. After winning, you'll get the **??? Memory**.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If Eizen is in Trunkleaf City, win his game.

**ZCell 137: Atebit Kingdom**

!img("zcell137.png")



If you freed Giratina earlier:

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,0], "Glitch Field")

If you didn't free Giratina earlier, well....

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,1], "Glitch Field")

After defeating him, you'll be ejected from this area.



## Hospital of Ruin (2nd Visit)

Time to continue the story! Fly to Yui's Ranch, then enter GDC and make your way to the penthouse. After a quick scene, talk to Delpha and agree to go.

Enter Isha's backroom prepared for battle.

Doctor Isha (Factory Field)
-   Galarian Weezing, Level 85. @ Black Sludge.
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Toxic
    -   Strange Steam
    -   Flamethrower
-   Vanilluxe, Level 84. @ Icy Rock.
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Hidden Power Fire
    -   Blizzard
    -   Freeze Dry
-   Arctozolt, Level 84. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Blizzard
    -   Bolt Beak
    -   Surf
    -   Hail
-   Magnezone, Level 85. @ Synthetic Seed.
    -   Discharge
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Hidden Power Ice
    -   Signal Beam
-   Dusknoir, Level 86. @ Dusknoir Crest.
    -   Shadow Punch
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Earthquake
    -   Thunderpunch
-   Dracovish, Level 84. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Fishious Rend
    -   Crunch
    -   Psychic Fangs
    -   Ice Fang
-   Giratina, Level 86. @ Griseous Orb. \[ONLY IF YOU DID NOT SAVE IT,
    REPLACES WEEZING\]
    -   Outrage
    -   Aura Sphere
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Earthquake

This fight can potentially be tough - it mixes a lot of strategies and works somewhat well with the factory and dark factory fields. Weezing is pretty tanky and can spread Toxic but isn't too crazy. Arctozolt and Dracovish both hit hard but are on the slower side, so hitting them hard with Ground / Fairy / Dragon moves respectively is the way to stop them. Crest Dusknoir hits hard with Shadow Sneak on the Dark Factory - make sure that whatever you are going to attack it with can live a Technician Shadow Sneak. And, if you could take Giratina back in your Level 30's, you can now.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I've been great! (Venam +3)
- It's been going. (Neutral)

After the rest of the cutscenes play out... we did it! There are a couple quests we can take care of right now before progressing the story further.

As a note, if we head over to the Pokemon Hospital south from here, we can spend $50000 at night to max out one EV, max out one IV, and give Pokerus to a single Pokemon. This is really only critical for the IV itself, but the price is high. Up to you if you have a particularly bad IV.

Head over to the Botanical Gardens if Florin is still alive.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- That's great, Florin! (Florin +2)
- You? Mayor? (Florin -2)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'd love to! (Florin +2)
- Sorry, I'm busy... (Florin -2)


## Department Store and Deino

Next, fly over to the GDC and enter the department store. We've gotten a ton of stamps in this episode's content, so it's time to go on a shopping spree! Add Gible to your party and fly to Yui's Ranch, enter GDC, then go to the shopping district and into the store.

## League Administration

### Day 01: Vs. Melia

In Sashila, head up when prompted. You'll be thrown into a battle as Alexandra.

The Storm (Desert Field)
-   STORM \| Wind, Level 80. @ Demon Stone. Type: Flying. Ability:
    Tempest. Stats: 450/70/150/140/150/20.
    -   Weather Ball
    -   Hurricane
    -   Thunder
    -   Psyshock

You can defeat this thing easily. Notice what weather gets activated by its ability each turn and try to use moves boosted by it if you want, but with Damien on your side it's very winnable.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Count me in! (Melia +3, Aelita +3, Ren +3, Venam +2, Alexandra +6)
- I'm scared... (Ren +2, Aelita +2, Erin +2, Damien +2)
- What are we talking about? (Erin -3, Melia -3, Ren -3, Aelita -5, Damien -6, Alexandra -6, Allen +3)

Me too, Allen.

Enter Alexandra's secret passageway and enter at the top.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You mean Marianette? (Venam +2)
- My third badge? (Neutral)
- What? (Neutral)

Afterwards, prepare yourself for a battle with Melia!

Pokemon Trainer Melia (Fairy Tale Field)
-   Hydreigon, Level 85. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Protect
-   Azumarill, Level 84. @ Assault Vest.
    -   Play Rough
    -   Liquidation
    -   Ice Punch
    -   Aqua Jet
-   Mimikyu, Level 84. @ Magical Seed.
    -   Swords Dance
    -   Play Rough
    -   Shadow Claw
    -   Shadow Sneak
-   Snorlax, Level 84. @ Chople Berry.
    -   Return
    -   Earthquake
    -   Heavy Slam
    -   Heat Crash
-   Togekiss, Level 85. @ Babiri Berry.
    -   Aura Sphere
    -   Gilded Arrows (Flying Type)
    -   Nasty Plot
    -   Draining Kiss
-   Aegislash, Level 85. @ Magical Seed.
    -   King's Shield
    -   Swords Dance
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Sacred Sword

Gilded Arrows: Type is the same as the user's secondary type, unless the user is single-typed or their secondary type is Dragon or Fairy, in which case the type is the user's primary type \| Special \| 50 power, hits twice \| 100% accuracy \| Increased critical hit rate.

The field effect is unalterable by moves, a broken seed effect that gives Aegislash one and Mimikyu TWO free turns turn to reach +4/+6 attack, all fire moves given an added Dragon typing hence can't touch Togekiss, Mimikyu or Azumarill and are now neutral against Aegislash, it's very stacked against you.

The good news is that you are given a couple options to make this fight work in your favor. For one, Steel moves also get a 1.5x boost and hit dragons super effectively, so they hit half of her team hard. Bullet Punch is a savior here. Snorlax with its berry will probably live one hit but doesn't particularly have synergy with the field, so if you can lower its attack or burn it, that may be your opportunity to set up. Normal types are immune to Aegislash and Mimikyu's Ghost Attacks, so since they are not the fastest in the world a speedy normal type capable of knocking them out in one attack (after Disguise) might be the way to go. I might have cried when I saw that this field made its way into this game, but if I can overcome it you can too!

To win, you'll receive the *Fate Badge*!

Outside, talk to Melia again.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Jenner was your father. (Melia +3)
- That's kinda cool! (Melia -3)

Tell Alexandra you're ready for training.

### Day 03: Aelita's Departure

This day is just a quick scene!

### Day 08: MC's Training

Talk to Ren in the hallway.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to her next time (Ren +2)
- You need some work... (Neutral)

Then, enter the battle room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm pumped. (Erin +2, Damien +2)
- I'm excited, I guess... (Erin +1)
- Eh... (Erin -1, Damien -2)

Enter the rental battle with Venam. The strategy that worked for me was: Switch Manectric for Walrein, Waterfall on Houndoom turn 1. Then turn 2 was Blizzard with Walrein and Waterfall on Dugtrio, turn 3 was mega +
discharge, waterfall on Dugtrio, then turn 4 was discharge + high horsepower to finish off Kingler.

### Day 11: Aelita's Return

Head in to talk to Aelita.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- ...The statues? (Aelita +2)
- The Soul Stone (Aelita +1)
- I have no idea... (Aelita -1)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I don't remember... (Neutral)
- It couldn't have been me... (Neutral)
- ... (Damien -2)

Interact with the obelisk! Inside it's straightforward. You'll get the *Interceptor's Wish*!

### Day 15: Melia Vs. Erin

Back in the league administration you'll be thrusted into a 1v1 battle as Melia. Win or lose, it doesn't matter.

### Day 18: MC's Day of Training, Pt. 2

Talk to Aelita in the hallway.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You'll be the Sensei too! (Aelita +3)
- What about GDC? (Aelita -1)

Next is a fight with Ren, one that will pit you against Ren on a disadvantageous field with a disadvantageous team. I chose the Fire team here and, while a tough battle, you can win by starting with Marowak and Heatmor, targeting Slowbro and then sending in Pyroar to finish off Mantine then Dewgong with Wild Charges.

Sleep for the night in the leftmost room.

### Day 29: Graduation

Finally, we get to obtain the *Mega-Z Ring*! This allows us to use Z-Moves as well as Mega Evolve our Pokemon!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Thank you, everyone! (Melia +2, Ren +2, Aelita +3, Damien
+1, Alexandra +3, Erin +1)
- I can't believe it... (Melia +1, Aelita +2, Ren +1, Erin
+1)
- Cool... I guess. (Aelita -1, Melia -1, Alexandra -2, Erin
-1, Venam -1, Ren -1, Allen +5, Alice +5)

Gosh, Allen and Alice are so cool.

Once you get control, take the time to fly over to Eclysia Pyramid if you'd like. Head up the stairs to the right and follow the path: you'll be able to fight **Galarian Corsola** up here!

Then, head back to League Administration. Interact with the thing at the table and select Path 1.

## Diamond Route

During the conversation Erin and Kanon have on the boat, if you had previously spoken to Erin in the Magnolia Library towards the beginning of the game, you'll get Relationship Points (+2 Erin).

On the boat, choose whether you'll activate Interceptor's Wish. If you do, Erin will be using *your team*, whereas if you don't, she uses hers. Battle advice is easier to give when I know what your team is gonna be, so for this guide I will not be activating it.

Follow the underwater path. Inside the manor, avoid the Regice, as you'll have to fight them. Make your way through the path here, watch the scene in the courtyard, then head onto the roof.

Follow the path to the right, then talk to Angie on the rooftop. Enter the left door and beat the maid. Take the left door on the higher floor in this complicated room, then beat the maids as you follow the path. Back in the Shellder room, head east onto the rooftop, this time following the path right through the dance room!

Enter the window to the baby's room, then follow the path down the stairs. Try to exit the bottom door in the next room. After a conversation with Kanon return to the rooftop. Head back out the window at the bottom, then drop down the first spot on the roof you can from the right.

Inside, get the *Dungeon Key* and talk to the book for some relationship points (Erin +4, Kanon +4). After exiting the office on top, go left, down, across the outside area, left through the lower level left door, then left, up, and left into the Ballroom.

Ice Soldiers Erin and Kanon (No Field)
-   Absol, Level 90. @ NeverMeltIce.
    -   Ice Shard
    -   Icicle Crash
    -   Blizzard
    -   Scald
-   Salamence, Level 90. @ NeverMeltIce.
    -   Ice Shard
    -   Icicle Crash
    -   Blizzard
    -   Scald

Nothing too bad: Blizzard from Ampharos can take care of Salamence and Florges can take Absol.

Get the *Dungeon Key* up at the top of this room, then make your way back to the big hub room and use it to enter the courtyard.

Step on the red tile. Beat the maids as you follow the path. Enter the ship and head downstairs. Then, talk to Patty in the nearby room and beat the maid. Next, reenter the cellar and defeat the maid looking at a wall. Return to Bonita, then head upstairs to get another *Dungeon Key*.

Enter the locked door in the cellars. After you see all of the scenes here, back in the dungeon, exit to the left. Back in the courtyard, head to the top door to confront Angie.

This one can be tough, but not as bad as our first encounter with Angie. Erin's Aevian Ampharos is good here, able to survive a decent chunk of the ice attacks and then hit back like a Truck. I would recommend starting with something fast like Zangoose on the left side and Ampharos on the right, then focus all your attacks on Angie's Pokemon (Mamoswine, Beartic, Walrein) to start, since they're all the most threatening. Once you knock them out Cera's three are easy to knock out.

That's it for the Diamond Route!

## Pearl Route

Again, you'll be given the choice to activate the Interceptor's wish. I choose not to for this guide.

As Melia, take a stroll around the town. Head into the mart, then defeat Sariah.

In the grove, talk to the Arceus statue. Head down and prepare for a battle. You get to pick whether Ren or Venam is your partner, or perhaps you can do it alone if you want.

    -   Rock Slide
    -   Zen Headbutt
    -   Solar Flare
    -   Trick Room

I picked Ren, and this was a cakewalk compared to last time. Let Mega Snorlax come out during the trick room and it will go first and can hit hard with Heavy Slam, and the rest of yours and Ren's Pokemon can fill in the rest.

In the Den of Souls, head up. You'll have to defeat a couple more mechs! Afterwards, follow the path to the right and find the open building. Explore upstairs then head out. We're looking for three green rods: one is hidden up and to the right, another is up from where we found Ren, and the other is near where we started. Reactivate the generator.

Prepare to fight a mech Gyarados!

Defense Mech Gyarados (Crystal Cavern)
-   Defense Mech Gyarados, Level 90. @ Sitrus Berry. Ability: Liquid
    Voice. Type: Water/Steel. Stats: 300/110/150/100/150/51
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Hyper Beam
    -   Signal Beam
    -   Scald

Every time it attacks, it attacks twice. Luckily, it's not too hard with Ren assisting - Meganium's Light Screen will help you survive.

Afterwards, return to the building and head upstairs. Head back out and go up when you're ready.

Team Xen Madelis (Crystal Cavern)
-   Cinccino, Level 84. @ Life Orb.
    -   Bullet Seed
    -   Rock Blast
    -   Tail Slap
    -   Wake Up Slap

-   Houndoom, Level 85. @ Houndoominite.
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Sunny Day
    -   Sludge Bomb.

This is a tough fight in general, but I found a pretty easy way to win with Melia's team. Simply knock out Cinccino and damage Crobat with Mega Snorlax's Return, then when it goes down swap to Mimikyu. Swords Dance, Shadow Sneak to finish Crobat. Then Play Rough to Shadow Sneak Houndoom who should turn the field dark, then Shadow Sneak Salazzle to one shot it, then Play Rough Tsareena. Now it will go down but Hydreigon, Gardevoir, and Meganium can deal with the rest.

Head up and into this building. Make your way up, battling grunts as you go. When you reach the gatling gun, spam the up arrow. Enter the door after defeating the mechs and grab the shining key. Enter the door on the right: read each letter in each open room and open the next door. Finally, enter the last door in this area and go up. Make your way through and watch the scenes, and when you're able, exit back to where we started. Take the elevator up, then the second elevator to the Den of Souls.

After a scene, head up.

Team Xen Admin Cassandra (Blessed Field)
-   Shadow Bisharp, Level 84. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Shadow Break
    -   Stealth Rock
    -   Iron Head
    -   Night Slash

    -   Gunk Shot
    -   Play Rough
    -   Recover
-   Cinccino, Level 85. @ Cinccino Crest.
    -   Return
    -   Play Rough
    -   Retaliate
    -   Knock Off
-   Mawile, Level 86. @ Mawilite.
    -   Play Rough
    -   Iron Head
    -   Sucker Punch
    -   Swords Dance

This is a tough battle as Cassandra has a lot of threats, and if you're playing as Melia's team, well, then Serperior, Cinccino and Lycanroc can outspeed your entire team. As such you need to leverage your team correctly - for instance, Togekiss can easily dispatch the Shadow Bisharp and Serperior, while Meganium can tank Cinccino and chip Mega Mawile well. Aevian Milotic will go down to a couple of Earthquakes from Mega Snorlax, and Mimikyu is a good choice to throw out a Swords Dance boosted move when you need it. Even if it takes a couple tries Cassandra is easily beaten with the right approach.

That's it for the Pearl Route!

A little note here: it turns out that as soon as you get the Zygarde 10% from Ayuda, the new cells won't appear. For completeness I will list them anyways in the guide going forward, but keep in mind if you already did the Zygarde exchange you won't be able to find these. Anyways, downstairs on the left, you'll find:

ZCell 106: Axis High University

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image111.png"/>

Then, head upstairs in the middle, and talk to Huey.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- That's right! (Lavender +2, Huey +2)
- Uh.... (Lavender -2)
- Not really, no. (Huey -3, Lavender -4)
- Where's Reina? (Neutral)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image112.png"/>

- I trust you! (Amber +6, Aelita +3)
- Uh... (Amber -2, Aelita -1)

Interact with the fountain next, then head to the dorms downstairs to sleep. The next day, head to the auditorium for the announcement!

## Aelita School Route

I will begin with Path 1. Once more you'll be given a choice to activate the Interceptor's Wish, I declined.

Head outside. Enter this classroom to the left and use the 'A' key to do a group investigation in here. Back outside, you'll find that Zetta has taken up the shop.

Nightmare University Shop

|Item          |Price|
|--------------|-----|
|*Super Potion*|$700 |
|*Full Heal*   |$600 |
|*Ultra Potion*|$2200|

Do a group investigation on the three entryway areas if you'd like, then head to the left area to give the Masked Men the password: "Sorry".

Downstairs talk to Ms. Erable, then to the student on the right with the "!" over his head. Say no to battling them, then you'll battle. Then say yes to the person on the left and return to Ms. Erable.

Axis High University Student Jean (No Field)
-   Zekrom, Level 90. @ Lum Berry.
    -   Focus Blast
    -   Reflect
    -   Bolt Strike
    -   Outrage

This has two shields. Take advantage of Granbull and Staraptor's Intimidates, then hit it hard with your strongest moves.

After all that, find the fifth door from the bottom on the third story, right side and enter "Dreamyard". Enter Huey's door!

Talk to the Rapidash rider then the girl in the bottom corner. Press the red panel here, then in the next area, follow the stairs to the next panel. The third panel is all the way at the bottom from here. At the top, defeat the trainer then head to the right and fight her again at the bottom. Then follow the path to finish Huey's area.

Head outside and enter the pyramid. At the top left talk to the girl and agree to help. Then go left and across the bridge to make friends with Grigus. Battle Huey, but intentionally lose to progress. You'll be awarded 10 *Phantom Candy S*!

Pick a partner or choose to go alone, time to fight Grigus.

Axis High Student Random Student (No Field)
-   Coffee Grigus, Level 87. @ Demon Stone.
    -   Sky Uppercut
    -   Ice Hammer
    -   Meteor Mash
    -   Shadow Punch

It has three shields and hits twice; however, this fight is very easy. Spam your strongest moves and you'll easily win. Pick up the piece of the treasure afterwards! Head back into the main room, you'll find the invisible person near the bottom. Talk to the girl at the top then enter this new room at the bottom.

Grab the thing when you get a chance and head back to the main room to reassemble the bridge. Enter Aelita's door!

Talk to both pink bookshelves then the pink plant. Then follow cyborg Deagan! Talk to each nurse from behind, then head out once Deagan touches the sunflower.

Doctor Isha (Factory Field)
-   Galarian Weezing, Level 85. @ Rocky Helmet.
    -   Strange Steam
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Pain Split
    -   Flamethrower
-   Arctozolt, Level 86. @ Quick Claw.
    -   Bolt Beak
    -   Icicle Crash
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Ice Beam
-   Hydreigon, Level 87. @ Metronome.
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Nasty Plot
    -   Roost

Easy enough for your team!

Once this part finishes up, interact with the box outside. Time for another battle!

Masked Man ??? (Desert Field)
-   Girafarig, Level 87. @ Twisted Spoon.
    -   Psychic
    -   Nasty Plot
    -   Hyper Voice
    -   Energy Ball
-   Komala, Level 87. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Sucker Punch
    -   Zen Headbutt
    -   Wood Hammer
    -   Thrash
-   Comfey, Level 87. @ Big Root.
    -   Draining Kiss
    -   Giga Drain
    -   Leech Seed
    -   Calm Mind
-   Hippowdon, Level 88. @ Leftovers.
    -   Earthquake
    -   Sand Tomb
    -   Ice Fang
    -   Slack Off

If you can get some chip damage off on Hippowdon with Cherrim and Granbull, Hawlucha can take care of most of this team.

Return to the auditorium, then reenter the Pyramid area where we fought Grigus, then return to the auditorium. Go up here, then follow the path to Lavender's door.

Enter the moon base and grab the crimson quartz in the upper room then heat it in the bottom. Head out... and we must run away from Risa!! Don't let yourself get hit too many times. Maneuver your way through the path, hitting switches as you go. Press the last green switch then back into the hallway and go up. Get the thing here then push the button and head down and to the right.

Grapple to the right and then do so again. Follow the path to the yellow switch in here, then in the previous room head down. Follow the path here to the green switch then return and go up. Through here you'll have to fight Risa. This one is impossible with Lavender's team, but that's ok.

Up in the next room try to escape, then interact with the panel. Now we have a real team for a real fight!

Pop Star Risa Raider (Factory Field)
-   Reshiram, Level 90. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Dragon Claw
    -   Fusion Flare
    -   Earth Power
    -   Crunch

Winning this one seems to rely on luck, but oh well. Yawn first turn with Espeon, then Pyrokinesis with Delphox. Swap in Exeggutor next and spam Pyrokinesis as much as you can while it's asleep, then put in Mega Alakazam when it wakes up and kills you. Thunder Wave it, then High Jump Kick and Play Rough from your remaining members should do just enough. If it wakes up too early and always hits through paralysis, you might still lose though, so a couple resets may be in order.

That's it for this part!

## MC School Route

Exit the auditorium and talk to the student here who has lost his brain. SEC is the storekeeper here and has the same items as Zetta did. Do a group investigation of the cafeteria here. Return to the guy to get *Mysterious Black Box* and some *Phantom Candy S*. The first trainer to the top will also give us *Phantom Candy S*.

Talk to the masked man and you'll be given a clue. Enter the classroom and do a group investigation. Return and try entering "ants troubled" if you like. The actual answer is "student labor."

Enter a room on the left and say you don't want to battle to battle someone. Win to get *Phantom Candy S* and another *Mysterious Black Box*. In the top left room answer the bottom answer, and you'll get *Phantom Candy M* and another *Mysterious Black Box*. Try to enter the machine in the lower area of the main room. Talk to it again. You'll need to generate different students based on their attributes, the chalkboards in the lower left classroom are the guide. So, make the following:

Student 1: Determined, Math, Medical Proficiency, Internship Experience

Student 2: Studious, English, Drama Proficiency, 10 or more performances

Student 3: Whimsical, Botany, Botanical Proficiency, Hugged a Tree.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Give her space. (Saki +2)
- She has amnesia. (Saki +1, Amber +1)
- ... (Saki -2)

Student 4: Studious, Engineering, Engineering Proficiency, 3 Years' Experience

Talk to the door at the top.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Of course (Amber +2, Saki +2)
- Um... I'm scared! (Saki -2, Amber -2)

-   Typhlosion, Level 86. @ Typhlosion Crest.
    -   Eruption
    -   Flare Blitz
    -   Extrasensory
    -   Thunderpunch

This one is somewhat tough but luckily not as bad as Mt. Valor! You'll need to watch out for Absol, who critical hits frequently thanks to its ability and item. The Typhlosion, Dragonite, Weavile, Minior we've all seen before and know how to deal with by now. Watch out for Hitmonlee who will get an Unburden boost after using Fake Out.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You got this Amber! (Amber +3)
- Good luck. (Amber +2)
- ... (Amber -2)

Inside, complete the first few tasks just as we did as Aelita. Now enter the right-side door. Beat the scientists in here then pick up the key and unlock the left door. Go down the elevator, into the door, and get the key. Use it back up from the elevator. Pick up the final key and reenter the main hallway.

Doctor Isha (Factory Field)
-   Galarian Weezing, Level 85. @ Rocky Helmet.
    -   Strange Steam
    -   Sludge Bomb

-   Hydreigon, Level 87. @ Metronome.
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Nasty Plot
    -   Roost

A bit harder since you only have three this time, but nonetheless very doable.

*Relationship Point Choices:*
- I'm happy for you! (Amber +2)
- ... (Amber -1)

Make your way all the way back to the auditorium as soon as you are prompted to.

Masked Individual ??? (No Field)
-   Roserade, Level 84.
    -   Stun Spore
    -   Magical Leaf
    -   Sludge Bomb

-   Hippowdon, Level 85. @ Leftovers.
    -   Earthquake
    -   Curse

-   Piloswine, Level 84. @ Eviolite.
    -   Protect
    -   Toxic
    -   Earthquake
    -   Icicle Spear

Again, probably easy for your team at this point.

Head upstairs. Interact with a terminal on the right. Your goal is to get the red box into the green space. With enough tinkering you can figure it out. Do this at all the other terminals around the room.

After you finish, talk to the main table thing, then go around the room bashing suspicious walls. That is, any that don't fit it with what's around them. Then return to the table.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you doing okay? (Amber +2)
- What happened? (Neutral)
- You done? (Saki -2, Amber -2)

Then head upstairs and enter your building on the left. Answer however you like.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- What? (Neutral)
- Yes. (Saki -2)

Return to the underground to the broken machine in the upper left room. It's time for a great sequence. Destroy all the robots you can find, eventually making your way to the third floor. Bust your way through the panels.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- My body screams for more. (Saki +5, Amber +3)
- It was awesome! (Saki +3, Amber +2)
- It was... interesting. (Amber +1)
- Eh. (Amber -2, Saki -3)

Take the teleporter then go up.

Masked Individual (No Field)
-   Genesect, Level 88. @ Douse Drive.
    -   Techno Blast (Water)
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Bug Buzz
    -   Shift Gear

Obviously, a fast fire move will do the trick here.

Head back to the teleporter and talk to the Saki door.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Kick ass, Saki! (Saki +3)
- Uh... Good luck? (Saki +/-2)

Put the mannequins into pods... yikes.

Head up and interact with the monitor thing. Then go up and talk to the box thing. Then input 7496 into the monitor. Talk to Amber then push the red switch at the bottom then go down the newly opened stairs.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It did. (Neutral)
- I don't know. (Neutral)
- I'm hungry. (Saki +2)

Then when you return head out and go down the lift.

After learning about all this, it's finally time to enter the player's door!

This area is straight forward. When all is said and done, you'll have to fight... your protagonist. Each protagonist has a different team, so find the one that applies to you.

## Axis High University 3rd Visit

When you can, return upstairs and enter the stairs at the fountain. Follow the path to fight SEC again, who has a Shadow Machop. SEC in the next room has a Shadow Clobbopus. Get the *Fire Stone* here then follow the path. On the left side of the area, you'll be able to grab a *Nightmare Fuel*.

Head up - it's time to fight illusions. You get relationship points depending on if you're right - choosing Erick 2 grants (+6 Erick), choosing Erick 1 grants (-4 Erick). Choosing Aelita 2 grants (-4 Aelita)
and will open you up to one more question:

**Relationship Point Choices** (Aelita 2 Chosen):
- Aelita, I'm sorry... (Aelita +1)
- Could've been more clear! (Aelita -2)

...but it is a higher net to just choose Aelita 1 no matter what.

Anyways, time for a battle!

The Naganadel has two shields, and her Stantler and Beheeyem each have crests that make both much better. That said, if you don't let Naganadel get too many Beast Boosts her team is overall slow and you can sweep them with the right Pokemon.

That said, winning this battle is technically optional. Losing takes away Relationship Points however (Aelita -1, Adam -1, Braixen -1, Erick
-1).

**Relationship Point Choices**:

- I hate this. (Erick +3)

This is a tough battle that takes full advantage of both field effects in play here! On the first turn, you'll notice that Chandelure's and Corviknight's abilities cause tanky Mega Corviknight to be targeted. This means Chandelure will likely get off a Trick Room on the first turn which will last 8 turns on the field, greatly benefitting her slow team. When her Aurorus comes in, the field will return to Fairy Tale since the hail blocks out the weather, which as in the Melia fight makes Sirfetch'd, Samurott and Aegislash particularly deadly.

That said, luckily there are no fairies this time, so Heat Wave + Sun can work well on most of the team. You can either anticipate the Trick Room and bring a slow team or manage to somehow knock out or prevent Chandelure from moving on the first turn if you can. The field effects are not ridiculously stacked against you this time though, so take advantage of Fairy Tale Field and you will find a way to win.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm so sorry. (Saki +2, Aelita +2)
- It's going to be okay. (Neutral)
- She was lost. (Saki -1)
- That wasn't Hazuki. (Saki -2)

Head up and follow the path to obtain the ZCrystal *Intercept-Z*!

Puppet Master (Starlight Field)
-   Puppet Master, Level 85. @ Leftovers. Ability: World of
    Nightmares. Type: Dark/Psychic. Stats: 500/50/300/60/300/1. 4 Shields.
    -   Nightmare
    -   Bunraku Beatdown
    -   Spirit Break
    -   Dream Eater

Equip the Intercept-Z to a Pokemon first and you'll have a much easier time, but it's not necessary. It's very slow, so you can easily drop its defenses or use Knock Off for its Leftovers and wear it down. Aelita will help you break the 4 shields too with field boosted Dazzling Gleam. If you use any weather, you'll change the field to nothing, which can be useful.

Puppet Master (Starlight Field)

    -   Spirit Break
    -   Dream Eater

Even easier than the first time. The Intercept-Z helps as before!

Huey is not too bad! Just make sure he doesn't get stupidly powerful with Octillery or Glalie's moody and you'll be fine.

Now we get to play as Saki for a bit. Interact with all the ... as well as Saki's parents then pick up the phone in the upper left corner.

Back as the player, enter the first room.

Make sure you catch an Aevian Litwick to show to Zumi.

Make your way through the path to the left. There is a sneakily hidden door at the bottom of the left-most side, follow that down. Make your way to the right and open a chest for 3 *Green Shards*. Then step on all three of the yellow switches and make them blue.

In the next area using the rail cart, step on the switch and open the chest for 3 *Yellow Shards*. Then follow Sakitron down from where she starts.

In this next area, use the rail carts to go left and step on the switch. Activate Sakitron, follow it and go left for *Exp. Candy XL*. Defeat all the trainers in this area and a *Dungeon Key* will appear. Get it and open the nearby door. Head down, beat the trainers and grab the *Dungeon Key* behind them.

Before we go, we can solve a puzzle with these statues. Turn the top-left one South, the top-right one West, the bottom-left one East, and the bottom-right one North. You'll get an *Adamant Mint*!

Man, this guy keeps showing up and is never any less annoying. First, for some arbitrary reason, compared to all the previous encounters with Haunted Field, this time you can't change the field at all. All his Pokemon hit hard, and he even walks in with some of them burned, so you can't status them. Mega-Gengar is insanely fast and with field boosted Shadow Ball can kill almost anything, Krookodile starts strong and can go on a Moxie rampage starting with its Z-move, Aevian Parasect's ability guarantees it a second life after you knock it out the first time, Unaware Clefable is as annoying as ever, and so on.

If you can knock out Clefable, a speed boosted sweeper of some sort might be all you need to tear into his team. As before, your own ghost types will do well here, and since some fire moves gain Ghost typing, once you can knock out Chandelure, one might tear through him.

Push the button and enter the teleporter. Go left then down and enter the newly opened door to get a *Master Key*.

Head into the gym door at the top and get ready for quite a battle.

Gym Leader Saki (Glitch Field + Wonder Room)
-   Aggron, Level 85. @ Synthetic Seed.

    -   Super U.M.D. Attack
    -   Zen Headbutt
    -   Cosmic Power
    -   Bullet Punch

Super U.M.D. Move: Steel \| Physical \| 100 power \| 100% accuracy \| Alternates between lowering the target's Attack & Special Attack by 1 stage each, and lower the target's Defense & Special Defense by 1 stage each.

The first 10 or so attempts you'll have at this battle will probably be wrapping your head around what is happening. Basically, on Glitch Field, special defense and special attack are calculated by whichever of the two is highest. This, plus Wonder Room, which swaps a Pokemon's raw defense and raw special defense, means that Saki's extremely defensive team members now hit their special moves with their defense stats: Mega Metagross uses 150 base special attack to power field boosted Zen Headbutt. On top of this, Super U.M.D. Attack is a 100 power physical steel move that every single one of her team carries which alternates between lowering your attack stats and your defense stats. Bronzong and Aggron also have the notorious Glitch Field Synthetic Seed boost, which grants +1 in defense and special defense as well as replacing their types with ???, removing their weaknesses to make them very tough to take down. Bastiodon is also very gnarly thanks to its crest which deals recoil damage to the player and heals Bastiodon in addition to Sturdy.

That said, as one of the developers kindly told me when I was stuck, there is an advantage built in to the field! All the Pokemon except Mega-Metagross are slow, and on Glitch field, the faster Pokemon has a
+1 critical hit chance. This means that any Pokemon holding a Razor Claw or Scope Lens that is faster than any of Saki's Pokemon has a 50% chance of doing critical hits, meaning that half of the time you can ignore the defense boosts granted by the seeds of Bronzong and Aggron. What's more, a high crit move like Night Slash will have a 100% chance of breaking through! Another strategy you can consider is bringing your own defensive Pokemon. Just like with Saki's team, defense will then translate to special attack, allowing you to hit hard Special type moves
(especially Fire). Physical type moves (especially Ground and Fighting)
are also decent here, as the wonder room swaps Saki's team members' relatively poor special defense to the defense stat.

Win to get *TM91 Flash Cannon* as well as the Forgery Badge. At this point, if you have at least 3 points with Saki you'll get more Relationship Points (Saki +4, Amber +4, Venam +4).

Right afterwards, if you have at least 3 points with Amber, you'll get even more Relationship Points! (Amber +4, Venam +4)
