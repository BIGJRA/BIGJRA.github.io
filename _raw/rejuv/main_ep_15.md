# Chapter 15: Vague Clarity

We will be taken to Sashila Village. Before continuing the story, a whole bunch of quests are open to us now that we have defeated Ryland.

## Zone Zero Quests

Take a Braviary over to the Pyramid Outskirts and go up. 

!enc(606)

Surf to the left side and the right side of the pyramid to get *Ground Memory* and *TM28 Dig*. Could've been useful 15 minutes ago! You can also give a treat to **Riolu** for a battle.

Next, enter the Eclysia Skyview, then make your way down the lift. Once you use a teleporter, head left and surf up and across. Pick up the *Magic Wand* here, then exit the pyramid.

Make your way to the south side of Zone Zero. You'll see two open doors to the same apartment building. Enter the one on the right first.

!battle(["Venus",:CHALLENGER,0], "Big Top Arena")

These mad lad developers did it - they made Ledian decent! It's punching moves hit 4 times, meaning it's gonna do lots of damage with coverage and priority options. The rest of Venus's team is effective too, though almost entirely because of the team's synergy with the field.

Reborn players should be used to this field by now, but here are some strategies that tend to work on this field. Revelation/Petal/Fiery Dance are all boosted under this field, so a team using these that targets their low special defense might succeed. Dragon/Swords/Quiver Dance also boost stats even more, so a sweeper might see success here if they can get the opportunity to set up. Acrobatics also is boosted here and can help you get rid of Ledian, Rillaboom, and Centiskorch.

Succeed to nab the third *Star Shard*, as well as the *Ledian Crest*, and a *Somniam Mall Stamp*.

Outside, enter the building to the left. Go up and climb down the ladder to reach the area where we were ambushed by Bladestar.

**ZCell 134: Apartment Depths**

!img("zcell134.png")

Head up after grabbing this cell to get an *Ability Capsule*! Then, head left and follow the path all the way to the left to grab the shiny Lux Apartment keys. Exit the building and go straight to the right. Enter the tall apartment building with the key.

We have to complete a puzzle similar to Generation III's Abandoned Ship backrooms.

- Enter 1A. Interact with the upper right sparkle, one tile left from the top right.
- Enter 1F. Interact with the upper left tile on the table.
- Enter 1E to study the sparkles.
- Enter 1D. Interact with the rightmost tile of the bed.
- Enter 2F (upstairs) to study the sparkles.
- Enter 2E. Interact with In the bottom tile of the bed in the 2F side.
- Enter 2C. Exit via the 2B door.
- Enter 1B. Interact with the tile two above the right rock. Exit left.
- Enter 2D. Interact with the center tile to get the final key. Plus:

**ZCell 135: Lux Apartments**

!img("zcell135.png")

- Enter 2C and exit via the 2B door again.
- Enter 1C. Go down the ladder, click the lever in this area, and pick up *Rocky Helmet*.

To the left from the Zone Zero Pokemon Center on the northern map, you'll find that a gate has opened, leading you to be able to catch **Gible**, plus:

**ZCell 136: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell136.png")

Fly over to Kakori Village. Enter a house on the left side and present the *Magic Wand* to get **Fennekin**!

One more quest in the desert area: make your way to the southeast corner of the Zorrialyn Desert by Poiloethal Forest to begin the *Poisonous Luck* quest. Follow Jangmo'o to Luck's Tent in Zorrialyn Coast. Inside, you'll be able to purchase **Jangmo'o (Aevian)** in exchange for 13 Black Prisms!

Take the time to breed Aevian Jangmo'o and take the spare to a house in Zorrialyn Desert East. We can trade it for **Jangmo'o** (the Alolan kind)!

## Narcissa's Hauntings Conclusion

If you've progressed Narcissa's Hauntings so far, you can now continue this quest.

Fly to the Rose Theater, and enter Forlorned Cavern on Route 9. Enter the first room in the main area of the cave, with the Timesplicer Stone. After a scene with Narcissa, accept the fast travel to the Cliffside Grave if you've been already -- if not, [you'll need to explore Amethyst Cave](#amethyst-depths). Talk to her again, then accept fast travel to Phasial Cave.

Head up and watch the scenes play out. Then, in Narcissa's house, talk to her upstairs. Head out and go to the Wispy Tower. Talk to young Narcy here and go in. Enter the lab, and head left. Talk to her again. Enter the western room, and surf up. Watch the CD Rom, then return to Narcissa's house and talk to them again. Accept fast travel.

Follow the Rotom into the cave, then take the time crystal to the past. Interact with the safe here. Then, pull the lever in the top left corner, hiding in boxes. Go down the ladder and out. You can find hidden *Revival Herb*, *Full Heal*, *Health Wing*, and *Blue Shard* throughout the building. Unlock the gate, and head in.

After a scene, talk to Narcissa and agree to go. Enter the manor and head upstairs to the top left room. Talk to the safe after another scene for the *Fairy Memory* and *Shiinotic Crest*. Exit to the well in the backyard.

Grab the *Code Rembrence Rift Notes* and head up.

!partner(["Narcissa",:LEADER_NARCISSA,1])

!boss("DUFAUX", "Bewitched Field")

Dufaux is a difficult boss. Each phase of the fight adds something to Dufaux until it becomes a speedy spread move sweeper, so you have to do what you can to prevent this from happening. Narcissa is a very solid ally with supporting moves: using moves like Wide Guard and Protect to buy her time will help. Trick Room notably makes the final phases easier.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Finish Narcissa's Hauntings (+6 Narcissa)

Head to the Lost Castle. All the way at the top, you'll get a chance to battle **Rotom**!

Fly to West Gearen and go talk to Gabriel at the West Gearen power plant. Follow him left, up, and up to get access to a room where you can change Rotom's form! You'll also get another *Somniam Mall Stamp*!

## Missing Children 2

If you've completed all the steps of the *Missing Children* quest with Ana and Dylan so far, make your way to GDC. Make your way to the Underground. On the right side, you'll now be able to find:

**ZCell 137: The Underground**

!img("zcell137.png")

Enter Dylan's house.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sorry...! (+2 Particia, +2 Dylan)
- Yeah, that's my bad. (Neutral)
- I don't need to call. (-2 Particia, -3 Dylan)

Accept the fast travel request. Talk to Sienna in the mortuary, then head to the Pokemon Pinnacle to the left. Make your way to the top of the dungeon.

If you defeated Ana earlier:

!newself(["Ana",:NANO,1])

If you let Ana win:

!newself(["Ana",:NANO,2])

!dbattle(["Misa",:BLADESTAR_F,0], ["Peter",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Haunted Field")

At Pokestar Studios, talk to Ana on the right. Follow her to the left again and let the scenes play out. Back in the Underground, proceed left past Dylan's house.

!battle(["Nicole",:LADY,0], "Back Alley")

!battle( ["Rojin",:WORKERF,0], "Back Alley")

!battle(["Kurt",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "Back Alley")

You'll be taken to Dylan's Kristiline Town house. Head outside, then follow Ana to the Sapphire Museum. Follow her next to the Lava Cookie restaurant. After that conversation, go back to Dylan's and talk to her there. Talk to her once more to the left of the Pokemon Center.

Fly to Teila Resort and head to Route 5. The easiest way to reach the Secluded Shore is to dive down on the east side of Route 5, then surface just above the entrance to the Secluded Shore. You'll get 5 *Lava Cookies*!

Back in Kristiline, fly to Teila Resort and talk to Ana in the middle. Gather intel from the townspeople then talk to her again. We don't need to win the challenge, but if you'd like to, choose these options from her questions: first, fourth, second. Then talk to Gigiorno in the middle to get it started.

Back in Kristiline again, enter the house. That's all we can do in this quest for now!

As this quest showed, we now have access to Grand Dream City once more. There are a few things we can take care of. First, enter Scholar District and enter the Fan Club. For beating Adam we should now have enough reputation that when we walk in, we will get a *Somniam Mall Stamp* as well as the *Aerodactylite*! Talk to a girl to get the *Poisonium-Z* as well!

Head west to the Festival Plaza. There is a new tutor on the left.

!tutor("Festival Plaza North Tutor", [["Superpower", "6 Yellow Shards"], ["Heat Wave", "6 Blue Shards"], ["Stealth Rock", "6 Red Shards"], ["Future Sight", "4 Red Shards"], ["Flip Turn", "5 Green Shards"]])

We've now collected eight of the ten stamps for the mall, so we can buy a whole bunch of new stuff.

!shop("Somniam Mall Rare Gems", ["Fire Gem", "Water Gem", "Normal Gem", "Grass Gem", "Electric Gem", "Poison Gem", "Ground Gem", "Fighting Gem", "Flying Gem"])

!shop("Somniam Mall Rare Gems", ["Psychic Gem", "Bug Gem", "Rock Gem", "Ghost Gem", "Dark Gem", "Dragon Gem", "Steel Gem", "Ice Gem"])

!shop("Somniam Mall Miscellaneous", ["Big Root", "Focus Band", "Zoom Lens", "Scope Lens", "Link Heart", "Ability Capsule"])

!shop("Somniam Mall Rare Berries", ["Petaya Berry", "Liechi Berry", "Apicot Berry", "Lansat Berry", "Starf Berry", "Ganlon Berry", "Salac Berry"])

!shop("Somniam Mall TMs & HMs", [["TM150 Grassy Terrain", 10000], ["TM151 Electric Terrain", 10000], ["TM152 Misty Terrain", 10000], ["TM153 Psychic Terrain", 100000], ["TM34 Sludge Wave", 30000], ["TM55 Scald", 13000], ["TM90 Substitute", 10000], ["HM05 Waterfall", 150000]])

!shop("Somniam Mall Evolution Items", ["Protector", "Magmarizer", "Dragon Scale", "Electirizer", "DeepSeaTooth", "DeepSeaScale", "Up-Grade", "Dubious Disc", "Prism Scale", "Sachet", "Whipped Dream", "Razor Claw", "Oval Stone", "Razor Fang", "Reaper Cloth"])

## Atebit Doctor Quest

Make your way once more to the Eclysia Pyramid. Up the stairs on the right, you'll be able to enter a rift to return to the area with all the "GameBoys". Walk into the first to talk to Talon, beginning the *Atebit Doctor* quest.

Take the Purple GameBoy on the left and follow the path to the Pink GameBoy. Once you're in the Syxtenbit Caves, head down the ladder to the right. Grab the Black Prism across the ice and proceed. Chase Isha through this area, grabbing the *Razor Fang*, *Black Prism*, and *NeverMeltIce* along the way. An *Ice Heal* can be found in the maze to the left of Zubat.

!enc(521, ["Surfing", "Fishing"])

Continue pursuing Isha to the right. You can interact with **Sneasel (Hisuian)** on the right side! You can exit to the volcano area in the top right corner to catch more Cyndaquil, if you wish.

Isha is in the cave in the middle of the water down in Syxtenbit Cave, but we will confront him a bit later on. Head to the bottom left corner, where you'll see a *Black Prism*.

Nearby you'll see a ladder. Smash the rocks out of the way, push the boulder aside, and climb the ladder. Exit the cave, then immediately reenter the cave and climb back down the ladder. Push the boulder down a few times and it will fill a gap to the right, so you can get the *Groundium-Z*! Now head back up the ladder and exit for real.

We can surf in this outside area to reach new parts of the Atebit Kingdom. Surf to the right to reach the section we previously accessed via the library: a Larvitar can be caught at the top.

Surf down and left. West of "The Lighthouse" you'll be able to land on a blue dock. West of this, you can land in "Trunkleaf City".

If we had answered all of Eizen's Rivers' End questions correctly, he will offer us a game here, to relive the fight between Allen and Bladestar. Similarly to the fight with Amanda, we simply need to choose the attack that corresponds with whatever prompt our enemy says. After winning, you'll get the **??? Memory**.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If Eizen is in Trunkleaf City, win his game (+5 Alice, +5 Allen)

**ZCell 138: Atebit Kingdom**

!img("zcell138.png")

Make your way back down to the bottom of the Syxtenbit Cave when you are ready to fight Isha, and head in.

If you freed Giratina earlier:

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,0], "Glitch Field")

If you didn't free Giratina earlier, well....

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,1], "Glitch Field")

After defeating him, you'll be ejected from this area and returned to GDC.

While we're in GDC, one new thing to obtain is available: if Florin is still alive (by not taking the Berserk Florin route), head to the Treasure Treehouse. You'll find Talon here, who will task you with checking out a new area of Tyluric Temple. We have already explored this area: you can breed the Togepi (well, once you evolve it to **Togetic**) for a trade. Talon will next propose a trade, but talk to him a second time carefully, thanks to the maybe-maybe-not-intentional way this is coded:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Agree to Talon's Togepi trade *the first time he asks* (+2 Talon)

Anyways, he'll give you **Bagon**, holding the *Butterfreenite*!

One more thing to grab. Annoyingly out of the way this may be, make the way all the way back to the room in the Syxtenbit Cave where we fought Isha and grab the *Laprasite*!

## League Administration

Fly over to Sashila and talk to the group at the top. Head up in Alamissa Urben when you are ready.

!newself(["Alexandra",:ELITE_ALEXANDRA,0])

!partner(["Damien",:LEADER_DAMIEN,0])

!boss("STORMNINE", "Desert Field")

This fight shouldn't be too bad for Alexandra and Damien, thankfully.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Count me in! (Melia +3, Aelita +3, Ren +3, Venam +2, Alexandra +6)
- I'm scared... (Ren +2, Aelita +2, Erin +2, Damien +2)
- What are we talking about? (Erin -3, Melia -3, Ren -3, Aelita -5, Damien -6, Alexandra -6, Allen +3)

Me too Allen, me too.

Enter Alexandra's secret passageway and enter at the top.

### Day 01: Vs. Melia

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You mean Marianette? (Venam +2)
- My third badge? (Neutral)
- What? (Neutral)

Afterwards, prepare yourself for a battle with Melia!

!battle(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,0], "Fairy Tale Field")

!move("GILDEDHELIX")

The field effect is unalterable by moves, a broken seed effect that gives Aegislash one and Mimikyu TWO free turns turn to reach +4/+6 attack, all fire moves given an added Dragon typing hence can't touch Togekiss, Mimikyu or Azumarill and are now neutral against Aegislash: it's very stacked against you! Plus, her Zoroark has a crest that allows it to use Aegislash's Stance Change ability... so be careful of that.

The good news is that you are given a couple options to make this fight work in your favor. For one, Steel moves also get a 1.5x boost and hit dragons super effectively, so they hit half of her team hard; Bullet Punch is a savior here. Normal types are immune to Aegislash and Mimikyu's Ghost Attacks, so since they are not the fastest in the world a speedy normal type capable of knocking them out in one attack (after Disguise) might be the way to go. The Magical Seed "buys you time" to set up a sweeper, so I recommend using a couple of those if you're really stuck here.

To win, you'll receive the *Fate Badge*!

Outside, talk to Melia again.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Jenner was your father. (Melia +3)
- That's kinda cool! (Melia -3)

Tell Alexandra you're ready for training.

### Day 08: MC's Training

Talk to Ren in the hallway.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to her next time (Ren +2)
- You need some work... (Neutral)

Enter the battle room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm pumped. (Erin +2, Damien +2)
- I'm excited, I guess... (Erin +1)
- Eh... (Erin -1, Damien -2)

You'll be temporarily given a new team including Manectric, Swampert, and Walrein.

!battle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM3,2])

The strategy that worked for me was: Switch Manectric for Walrein, Waterfall on Houndoom turn 1. Then turn 2 was Blizzard with Walrein and Waterfall on Dugtrio, turn 3 was mega +
discharge, waterfall on Dugtrio, then turn 4 was discharge + high horsepower to finish off Kingler.

### Day 11: Aelita's Return

Head in to talk to Aelita.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- ...The statues? (Aelita +2)
- The Soul Stone (Aelita +1)
- I have no idea... (Aelita -1)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I don't remember... (Neutral)
- It couldn't have been me... (Neutral)
- ... (Damien -2)

Interact with the obelisk! Inside it's straightforward. You'll get the *Interceptor's Wish*!

### Day 15: Melia Vs. Erin

Back in the league administration you'll be thrusted into a 1v1 battle as Melia. Win or lose, it doesn't matter.

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,4])

!battle(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL2,0], "Chess Board")

### Day 18: MC's Day of Training, Pt. 2

Talk to Aelita in the hallway.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You'll be the Sensei too! (Aelita +3)
- What about GDC? (Aelita -1)

Next is a fight with Ren, one that will pit you against Ren. Pick a team between the three.

!battle(["Ren",:OUTCAST,5], "Dragon's Den")

Sleep for the night in the leftmost room.

### Day 29: Graduation

Finally, we get to obtain the *Mega-Z Ring*! This allows us to use Z-Moves as well as Mega Evolve our Pokemon!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Thank you, everyone! (Melia +2, Ren +2, Aelita +3, Damien
+1, Alexandra +3, Erin +1)
- I can't believe it... (Melia +1, Aelita +2, Ren +1, Erin
+1)
- Cool... I guess. (Aelita -1, Melia -1, Alexandra -2, Erin
-1, Venam -1, Ren -1, Allen +5, Alice +5)

Gosh, Allen and Alice are so cool.

Return to League Administration. Enter the bottom room and go right.

## Diamond Route

Select Path 1: the Diamond Route.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Erin at the Magnolia Library way earlier in the game (+2 Erin)

On the boat, choose whether you'll activate Interceptor's Wish. If you do, Erin will be using *your team*, whereas if you don't, she uses hers. I prefer not to activate Interceptor's Wish.

!newself(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL,5])

Follow the underwater path. Inside the manor, avoid the Regice, as you'll have to fight them. Make your way through the path here, watch the scene in the courtyard, then head onto the roof.

Follow the path to the right, then talk to Angie on the rooftop. Enter the left door.

!battle(["Ada",:SERVANT,0])

Take the left door on the higher floor.

!battle(["Berenice",:SERVANT,0])

!battle(["Havilah",:SERVANT,0])

!battle(["Hagith",:SERVANT,0])

Head back east to return to the rooftop, this time following the path right through the dance room!

Enter the window to the baby's room, then follow the path down the stairs. 

!battle(["Hannah",:SERVANT,0])

Try to exit the bottom door in the next room. After a conversation with Kanon return to the rooftop. Head back out the window at the bottom, then drop down the first spot on the roof you can from the right.

Inside, get the *Dungeon Key*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to the book in Anju's office (Erin +4, Kanon +4)

After exiting the office on top, go left, down, across the outside area, left through the lower level left door, then left, up, and left into the Ballroom.

!battle(["Erin & Kanon",:ICESOLDIERS,0])

Nothing too bad: Blizzard from Ampharos can take care of Salamence and Florges can take Absol.

Get the *Dungeon Key* up at the top of this room, then make your way back to the big hub room and use it to enter the courtyard.

Step on the red tile. 

!battle(["Hosanna",:SERVANT,0])

!battle(["Helah",:SERVANT,0])

Enter the ship and head downstairs. Then, talk to Patty in the nearby room and beat the maid. 

!battle(["Bebé",:SERVANT,0])

Next, reenter the cellar and defeat the maid looking at a wall towards the east side. 

!battle(["Malla",:SERVANT,0])

Return to Bonita, then head upstairs to get another *Dungeon Key*.

Enter the locked door in the cellars to get another *Dungeon Key*. After you see all of the scenes here, back in the dungeon, exit to the left. Back in the courtyard, head to the top door to confront Angie.

!dbattle(["Cera",:FAITHFUL,2], ["Angie",:LEADER_ANGIE2,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

This one can be tough, but not as bad as our first encounter with Angie. Erin's Aevian Ampharos is good here, able to survive a decent chunk of the ice attacks and then hit really hard in return. I would recommend starting with something fast like Zangoose on the left side and Ampharos on the right, then focus all your attacks on Angie's Pokemon (Mamoswine, Beartic, Walrein) to start. Once you knock them out, dealing with Cera's three is much easier.

That's it for the Diamond Route!

## Pearl Route

Again, you'll be given the choice to activate the Interceptor's wish. I choose not to for this guide.

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,3])

As Melia, take a stroll around the town. Head into the mart, then defeat Sariah.

!battle(["Sariah",:GHOSTGIRL,2])

In the grove, talk to the Arceus statue. Head down and prepare for a battle. You get to pick whether Ren or Venam is your partner, or you can do it alone.

!partner(["Ren",:OUTCAST,4])

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM3,1])

!battle(["Lorna",:ROGPSYCHIC,1], "Blessed Field")

In the 3rd Layer, head up. You'll have to defeat a couple more mechs!

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,6], "Crystal Cavern")

Go to the right and find the open building. Explore upstairs then head out. We're looking for three green rods: one is hidden up and to the right, another is up from where we found Ren, and the other is near where we started. Reactivate the generator.

Prepare to fight a mech Gyarados with Ren!

!boss("MECHAGYARADOS", "Crystal Cavern")

Afterwards, return to the building and head upstairs. Head back out and go up when you're ready.

!battle(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,5], "Crystal Cavern")

A lot of smart switching will make this fight a breeze for Melia.

Head up and into this building.

!battle(["Terasita",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

!battle(["Eddie",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

!battle(["Rashida",:XENANALYST_F,0])

!battle(["Harrold",:XENANALYST_M,0])

When you reach the gatling gun, spam the up arrow. 

!partner(["Lorna",:ROGPSYCHIC,1])

Defeat the wild Claydol mechs.

!battle(["Marco",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

Enter the door on the right outside after grabbing the shining key. Read each letter in each open room and open the next door. Finally, enter the last door in this area and go up. Make your way through and watch the scenes, and when you're able, exit back to Ren and Venam. Take the elevator up, then the second elevator to the Den of Souls. After a scene, head up.

!battle(["Cassandra",:XENADMIN_1,0], "Blessed Field")

This is a tough battle as Cassandra has a lot of threats, and if you're playing as Melia's team, well, then Serperior, Cinccino and Lycanroc can outspeed your entire team. As such you need to leverage your team correctly - for instance, Togekiss can easily dispatch the Shadow Bisharp and Serperior, while Meganium can tank Cinccino and chip Mega Mawile well. Aevian Milotic will go down to a couple of Earthquakes from Mega Snorlax, and Mimikyu is a good backup revenge killer or late-fight sweeper.

That's it for the Pearl Route!

## Axis High University

With both of those completed, you'll be in control of your character again. Choose path 3 and be given the *Rotom Phone*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I had an idea... (Aelita +2)
- Nope! (Aelita +1)
- School sucks. (Aelita -1)

Head up and into the school.

!shop("Axis High Shop", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Ultra Potion", "Max Repel"])

Walk down the stairs on the left.

**ZCell 139: Axis High University**

!img("zcell139.png")

Then, head upstairs in the middle, and talk to Huey.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- That's right! (Lavender +2, Huey +2)
- Uh.... (Lavender -2)
- Not really, no. (Huey -3, Lavender -4)
- Where's Reina? (Neutral)

In a room at the bottom is the... bobsled club? 

!battle(["Kayla",:GUITARIST,0])

!battle(["Dark",:AXISSTUDENT_FW,0])

!battle(["Will",:CHARMER,0])

!battle(["Squill",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

!battle(["Dylan",:CAMPER,0])

!battle(["Tim",:COOLTRAINER_M,0])

!battle(["Jared",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

!battle(["Matty",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

!battle(["Jeremiah",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

If you can defeat all the students, you'll be gifted the MegaStone *Cameruptite*!

In another room on this floor you'll find:

**ZCell 140: Axis High University**

!img("zcell140.png")

Head back downstairs, where you'll find Amber! You'll be given *Concert Tickets* and *Amber's Letter*! Talk to Saki in the cafeteria to the right. Then, find Aelita upstairs, east of the Bobsled Club.

Time for a 2v2 battle with Risa Raider downstairs, victory as usual being optional.

!battle(["Risa Raider",:POPSTAR,2])

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I trust you! (Amber +6, Aelita +3)
- Uh... (Amber -2, Aelita -1)

Interact with the fountain next, then head to the dorms downstairs to sleep. The next day, head to the auditorium for the announcement!

## Nightmare School: Aelita

I will begin with Path 1. Once more you'll be given a choice to activate the Interceptor's Wish, I declined.

!newself(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,5])

Head outside. Enter this classroom to the left and use the 'A' key to do a group investigation in here. Back outside, go right.

!battle(["Brigette",:AXISSTUDENT_FW,0])

You'll find that Zetta is running the shop:

!shop("Nightmare University Shop", ["Super Potion", "Full Heal", "Ultra Potion"])

!battle(["Naomi",:AXISSTUDENT_FB,0])

Do a group investigation on the three entryway areas if you'd like, then head to the left area to give the Masked Men the password: "Sorry".

Downstairs, talk to Ms. Erable, then to the student on the right with the "!" over his head. Say no, then you'll battle. 

!battle(["Zachary",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0])

Then say yes to the person on the left and return to Ms. Erable.

!battle(["Jean",:AXISSTUDENT_MB,0])

Take advantage of Granbull and Staraptor's Intimidates, then hit it hard with your strongest moves.

After all that, find the fifth door from the bottom on the third story, right side and enter "Dreamyard". Enter Huey's door!

!newself(["Huey",:OPTKID,2])

Talk to the Rapidash rider then the girl in the bottom corner. Press the red panel here, then in the next area, follow the stairs to the next panel. The third panel is in the bottom left corner. 

!battle(["???",:MYSTSTUDENT,0])

Head to the right and fight her again at the bottom. Follow the path to finish Huey's area.

Head outside and enter the pyramid. At the top left talk to the girl and agree to help. Then go left and across the bridge to make friends with Grigus. 

!battle(["Huey",:OPTKID,2], "Desert Field")

Battle Huey, but intentionally lose to progress. You'll be awarded 10 *Phantom Candy S*!

Pick a partner or choose to go alone.

!partner(["Huey",:OPTKID,2])

!partner(["Lavender",:LEADER_LAVENDER,1])

!boss("COFFEEGREGUS", "Desert Field")

Pick up the piece of the treasure afterwards! Head back into the main room, you'll find the invisible person near the bottom, on a tile containing part of a barrel. 

!battle(["Tucker",:AXISSTUDENT_MW,0], "Desert Field")

Talk to the girl at the top then enter this new room at the bottom.

Grab the thing in the middle and head back to the main room to reassemble the bridge. Enter Aelita's door!

Talk to both pink bookshelves then the pink plant. Then follow cyborg Deagan! Talk to each nurse from behind, then head out once Deagan touches the sunflower.

!battle(["Isha",:DOCTOR,3], "Factory Field")

Easy enough for Aelita's team!

Once this part finishes up, interact with the box outside. Time for another battle!

!battle(["???",:MASKEDMAN,2], "Desert Field")

Return to the auditorium. Reenter the Pyramid area where we fought Coffee Grigus, then return to the auditorium once more. Go up here, then follow the path to Lavender's door.

!newself(["Lavender",:LEADER_LAVENDER,2])

Enter the moon base and grab the crimson quartz in the upper room then heat it below. Head out... and we must run away from Risa! Don't let yourself get hit too many times. Maneuver your way through the path, hitting switches as you go.

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

In the bottom right corner, press the green switch but hop down to the left of the blue switch.

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,1], "Factory Field")

Press the last green switch then back into the hallway and go up. Get the thing here then push the button and head down and to the right.

Grapple to the right and then do so again. 

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,2], "Factory Field")

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,3], "Factory Field")

Follow the path to the yellow switch in here, then in the previous room head down. 

!battle(["???",:SCIENTIST,1], "Factory Field")

Follow the path here to the green switch then backtrack and go up. 

!battle(["Risa",:POPSTAR,3], "Starlight Arena")

Prioritizing defeating the physical attackers first should set up a nigh-unkillable Noctowl for the win.

Up in the next room try to escape, then interact with the panel. Now we have a real team for a real fight!

!newself(["Lavender",:LEADER_LAVENDER,3])

!boss("BOSSRESHIRAM", "Starlight Arena")

Reshiram one shots every one of your Pokemon, but you should be able to deal enough damage after putting it to sleep to emerge victorious. Save the slower Pokemon for the sleep turns and let the faster Pokemon trade damage when it is awake. 

That's it for this part!

## Nightmare School: MC

Exit the auditorium and talk to the student here who has lost his brain. SEC is the storekeeper here and has the same items as Zetta did. Do a group investigation of the cafeteria here. Return to the guy to get *Mysterious Black Box* and some *Phantom Candy S*. The first trainer to the top will also give us *Phantom Candy S*.

Talk to the masked man and you'll be given a clue. Enter the classroom and do a group investigation. Return and try entering "ants troubled" if you like. The actual answer is "student labor."

Enter a room on the left and say you don't want to battle to battle someone. Win to get *Phantom Candy S* and another *Mysterious Black Box*. In the top left room answer the bottom answer, and you'll get *Phantom Candy M* and another *Mysterious Black Box*. Try to enter the machine in the lower area of the main room. Talk to it again. You'll need to generate different students based on their attributes, the chalkboards in the lower left classroom are the guide. So, make the following:

Student 1: Determined, Math, Medical Proficiency, Internship Experience

Student 2: Studious, English, Drama Proficiency, 10 or more performances

Student 3: Whimsical, Botany, Botanical Proficiency, Hugged a Tree.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Give her space. (Saki +2)
- She has amnesia. (Saki +1, Amber +1)
- ... (Saki -2)

Student 4: Studious, Engineering, Engineering Proficiency, 3 Years' Experience

Talk to the door at the top.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Of course (Amber +2, Saki +2)
- Um... I'm scared! (Saki -2, Amber -2)

The Typhlosion, Dragonite, Weavile, Minior we've all seen before and know how to deal with by now. Watch out for Hitmonlee who will get an Unburden boost after using Fake Out.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You got this Amber! (Amber +3)
- Good luck. (Amber +2)
- ... (Amber -2)

Inside, complete the first few tasks just as we did as Aelita. Now enter the right-side door. Beat the scientists in here then pick up the key and unlock the left door. Go down the elevator, into the door, and get the key. Use it back up from the elevator. Pick up the final key and reenter the main hallway.

A bit harder since you only have three this time, but nonetheless very doable.

*Relationship Point Choices:*
- I'm happy for you! (Amber +2)
- ... (Amber -1)

Make your way all the way back to the auditorium as soon as you are prompted to.

Again, probably easy for your team at this point.

Head upstairs. Interact with a terminal on the right. Your goal is to get the red box into the green space. With enough tinkering you can figure it out. Do this at all the other terminals around the room.

After you finish, talk to the main table thing, then go around the room bashing suspicious walls. That is, any that don't fit it with what's around them. Then return to the table.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you doing okay? (Amber +2)
- What happened? (Neutral)
- You done? (Saki -2, Amber -2)

Then head upstairs and enter your building on the left. Answer however you like.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- What? (Neutral)
- Yes. (Saki -2)

Return to the underground to the broken machine in the upper left room. It's time for a great sequence. Destroy all the robots you can find, eventually making your way to the third floor. Bust your way through the panels.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- My body screams for more. (Saki +5, Amber +3)
- It was awesome! (Saki +3, Amber +2)
- It was... interesting. (Amber +1)
- Eh. (Amber -2, Saki -3)

Take the teleporter then go up.

Masked Individual (No Field)
-   Genesect, Level 88. @ Douse Drive.
    -   Techno Blast (Water)
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Bug Buzz
    -   Shift Gear

Obviously, a fast fire move will do the trick here.

Head back to the teleporter and talk to the Saki door.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Kick ass, Saki! (Saki +3)
- Uh... Good luck? (Saki +/-2)

Put the mannequins into pods... yikes.

Head up and interact with the monitor thing. Then go up and talk to the box thing. Then input 7496 into the monitor. Talk to Amber then push the red switch at the bottom then go down the newly opened stairs.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It did. (Neutral)
- I don't know. (Neutral)
- I'm hungry. (Saki +2)

Then when you return head out and go down the lift.

After learning about all this, it's finally time to enter the player's door!

This area is straight forward. When all is said and done, you'll have to fight... your protagonist. Each protagonist has a different team, so find the one that applies to you.

They're not insanely difficult, and you will succeed with the right strategy if you've made it here!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Don't let her get to you. (Aelita +4)
- It's alright. (Aelita +2)
- Watch what you say. (Aelita -2)

## Secret Axis Lab

When you can, return upstairs and enter the stairs at the fountain. Follow the path to fight SEC again, who has a Shadow Machop. SEC in the next room has a Shadow Clobbopus. Get the *Fire Stone* here then follow the path. On the left side of the area, you'll be able to grab a *Nightmare Fuel*.

Head up - it's time to fight illusions. You get relationship points depending on if you're right - choosing Erick 2 grants (+6 Erick), choosing Erick 1 grants (-4 Erick). Choosing Aelita 2 grants (-4 Aelita)
and will open you up to one more question:

**Relationship Point Choices** (Aelita 2 Chosen):
- Aelita, I'm sorry... (Aelita +1)
- Could've been more clear! (Aelita -2)

...but it is a higher net to just choose Aelita 1 no matter what.

Anyways, time for a battle!

-   Naganadel, Level 87. @ Life Orb.
    -   Sludge Wave
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Nasty Plot

The Naganadel has two shields, and her Stantler and Beheeyem each have crests that make both much better. That said, if you don't let Naganadel get too many Beast Boosts her team is overall slow and you can sweep them with the right Pokemon.

That said, winning this battle is technically optional. Losing takes away Relationship Points however (Aelita -1, Adam -1, Braixen -1, Erick
-1).

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm going too! (Aelita +3)
- I hate this. (Erick +3)
- Uh... on second thought... (Aelita -2)

Head back up to Axis High.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Whoey? (Lavender +1)
- Sorry... (Neutral)

Then after the scenes at the top, head down and to the right. Pick up another *Nightmare Fuel* as you go.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Kinda Cool! (Amber +1)
- Super Cool! (Amber +2)
- Mega Cool! (Amber +3)
- Eh... (Amber -1)

Return to take the teleporter.

Prepare yourself for a battle and head up.

Rogue Hero Hazuki (Starlight Field on top of Fairy Tale Arena)
-   Aevian Chandelure, Level 84. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Sacred Sword
    -   Razor Shell
    -   Night Slash
    -   Aqua Jet
-   Aegislash, Level 87. @ Magical Seed.
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   King's Shield
    -   Sacred Sword

This is a tough battle that takes full advantage of both field effects in play here! On the first turn, you'll notice that Chandelure's and Corviknight's abilities cause tanky Mega Corviknight to be targeted. This means Chandelure will likely get off a Trick Room on the first turn which will last 8 turns on the field, greatly benefitting her slow team. When her Aurorus comes in, the field will return to Fairy Tale since the hail blocks out the weather, which as in the Melia fight makes Sirfetch'd, Samurott and Aegislash particularly deadly.

That said, luckily there are no fairies this time, so Heat Wave + Sun can work well on most of the team. You can either anticipate the Trick Room and bring a slow team or manage to somehow knock out or prevent Chandelure from moving on the first turn if you can. The field effects are not ridiculously stacked against you this time though, so take advantage of Fairy Tale Field and you will find a way to win.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm so sorry. (Saki +2, Aelita +2)
- It's going to be okay. (Neutral)
- She was lost. (Saki -1)
- That wasn't Hazuki. (Saki -2)

Head up and follow the path to obtain the ZCrystal *Intercept-Z*!

Puppet Master (Starlight Field)
-   Puppet Master, Level 85. @ Leftovers. Ability: World of
    Nightmares. Type: Dark/Psychic. Stats: 500/50/300/60/300/1. 4 Shields.
    -   Nightmare
    -   Bunraku Beatdown
    -   Spirit Break
    -   Dream Eater

Equip the Intercept-Z to a Pokemon first and you'll have a much easier time, but it's not necessary. It's very slow, so you can easily drop its defenses or use Knock Off for its Leftovers and wear it down. Aelita will help you break the 4 shields too with field boosted Dazzling Gleam. If you use any weather, you'll change the field to nothing, which can be useful.

Puppet Master (Starlight Field)
-   Puppet Master, Level 85. @ Leftovers. Ability: World of
    Nightmares. Type: Dark/Psychic. Stats: 500/1/80/80/1/1
    -   Nightmare
    -   Bunraku Beatdown
    -   Spirit Break
    -   Dream Eater

Even easier than the first time. The Intercept-Z helps as before!

Optimistic Guy Huey (Starlight Field)
-   Kecleon, Level 81. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Knock Off
    -   Power Up Punch
    -   Sucker Punch
    -   Shadow Sneak
-   Gogoat, Level 82. @ Leftovers.
    -   Horn Leech
    -   Nature Power
    -   Bounce

    -   Earth Power
    -   Shore Up
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Shadow Ball
-   Octillery, Level 83. @ Expert Belt.
    -   Water Spout
    -   Hydro Pump
    -   Ice Beam
    -   Fire Blast
-   Flareon, Level 84. @ Toxic Orb.
    -   Flare Blitz
    -   Protect
    -   Facade
    -   Quick Attack

Huey is not too bad! Just make sure he doesn't get stupidly powerful with Octillery or Glalie's moody and you'll be fine.

Now we get to play as Saki for a bit. Interact with all the ... as well as Saki's parents then pick up the phone in the upper left corner.

Back as the player, enter the first room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Why me? (Erin -1)
- I'm on it. (Erin +2)
- Goddamnit... (Melia -2, Aelita -2, Erin -3)

Accept the fast travel to Axis. Head through the path then go back to the left. You'll find **Aevian Munna** roaming about!

Make sure you catch an Aevian Litwick to show to Zumi.

Make your way through the path to the left. There is a sneakily hidden door at the bottom of the left-most side, follow that down. Make your way to the right and open a chest for 3 *Green Shards*. Then step on all three of the yellow switches and make them blue.

In the next area using the rail cart, step on the switch and open the chest for 3 *Yellow Shards*. Then follow Sakitron down from where she starts.

In this next area, use the rail carts to go left and step on the switch. Activate Sakitron, follow it and go left for *Exp. Candy XL*. Defeat all the trainers in this area and a *Dungeon Key* will appear. Get it and open the nearby door. Head down, beat the trainers and grab the *Dungeon Key* behind them.

Before we go, we can solve a puzzle with these statues. Turn the top-left one South, the top-right one West, the bottom-left one East, and the bottom-right one North. You'll get an *Adamant Mint*!

Use the key above.

Man, this guy keeps showing up and is never any less annoying. First, for some arbitrary reason, compared to all the previous encounters with Haunted Field, this time you can't change the field at all. All his Pokemon hit hard, and he even walks in with some of them burned, so you can't status them. Mega-Gengar is insanely fast and with field boosted Shadow Ball can kill almost anything, Krookodile starts strong and can go on a Moxie rampage starting with its Z-move, Aevian Parasect's ability guarantees it a second life after you knock it out the first time, Unaware Clefable is as annoying as ever, and so on.

If you can knock out Clefable, a speed boosted sweeper of some sort might be all you need to tear into his team. As before, your own ghost types will do well here, and since some fire moves gain Ghost typing, once you can knock out Chandelure, one might tear through him.

Push the button and enter the teleporter. Go left then down and enter the newly opened door to get a *Master Key*.

Head into the gym door at the top and get ready for quite a battle.

Super U.M.D. Move: Steel \| Physical \| 100 power \| 100% accuracy \| Alternates between lowering the target's Attack & Special Attack by 1 stage each, and lower the target's Defense & Special Defense by 1 stage each.

The first 10 or so attempts you'll have at this battle will probably be wrapping your head around what is happening. Basically, on Glitch Field, special defense and special attack are calculated by whichever of the two is highest. This, plus Wonder Room, which swaps a Pokemon's raw defense and raw special defense, means that Saki's extremely defensive team members now hit their special moves with their defense stats: Mega Metagross uses 150 base special attack to power field boosted Zen Headbutt. On top of this, Super U.M.D. Attack is a 100 power physical steel move that every single one of her team carries which alternates between lowering your attack stats and your defense stats. Bronzong and Aggron also have the notorious Glitch Field Synthetic Seed boost, which grants +1 in defense and special defense as well as replacing their types with ???, removing their weaknesses to make them very tough to take down. Bastiodon is also very gnarly thanks to its crest which deals recoil damage to the player and heals Bastiodon in addition to Sturdy.

That said, as one of the developers kindly told me when I was stuck, there is an advantage built in to the field! All the Pokemon except Mega-Metagross are slow, and on Glitch field, the faster Pokemon has a
+1 critical hit chance. This means that any Pokemon holding a Razor Claw or Scope Lens that is faster than any of Saki's Pokemon has a 50% chance of doing critical hits, meaning that half of the time you can ignore the defense boosts granted by the seeds of Bronzong and Aggron. What's more, a high crit move like Night Slash will have a 100% chance of breaking through! Another strategy you can consider is bringing your own defensive Pokemon. Just like with Saki's team, defense will then translate to special attack, allowing you to hit hard Special type moves
(especially Fire). Physical type moves (especially Ground and Fighting)
are also decent here, as the wonder room swaps Saki's team members' relatively poor special defense to the defense stat.

Win to get *TM91 Flash Cannon* as well as the Forgery Badge. At this point, if you have at least 3 points with Saki you'll get more Relationship Points (Saki +4, Amber +4, Venam +4).

Right afterwards, if you have at least 3 points with Amber, you'll get even more Relationship Points! (Amber +4, Venam +4)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You got it, bro (Adam +3)
- Sure. (Adam +1)
- Really? Ugh... (Adam -3, Venam -2)

Next, return to Sashila, and enter the second room on the right to talk to Crescent.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- They're my friends. (Neutral)
- None of your business. (Crescent -4)

Then enter the leftmost room to talk to everyone else. We did it! Only side quests remain, for now.
