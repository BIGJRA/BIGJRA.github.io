# Chapter 14: Death of One, Birth of Another

You'll find yourself in New Game with Zetta again. Start the game, then talk to the characters. Talk next to the black piece below.

## Nastasia's Ship

Talk to the group in the meeting room of Nastasia's ship.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Fine... (+2 Aelita, +3 Ren)
- There's no way. (-2 Ren)

Head to the right.

After another conversation, you can talk to Sharon for a battle against the duo. 

!battle(["Eli and Sharon",:MISFORTUNATEDUO,15], "Factory Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Eli and Sharon on the airship (+2 Ren, +2 Aelita).

Head up the stairs and talk to Nastasia and Ren. Follow her into the room on the right, then go back downstairs.

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,0])

!dbattle(["Dustin",:XENGRUNT_M,0], ["Yasmine",:XENANALYST_F,0])

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Win this battle (+1 Aelita)

Accept Aelita's request for story time.

!newself(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,0])

As soon as you get control, head over to the spot on the left side of the arena when you are ready!

!battle(["Texen",:LEADER_TEXEN,1], "Forest Field")

Aelita's team makes this one a breeze. I recommend starting with Cherrim and Starmie - these two are fast and strong and clean up most of his team easily.

Afterwards, you'll get the *Cherrim Crest*. Tell Aelita you want to rest for a while once you're ready. Head outside the airship when you wake up!

## Zone Zero South

!enc(573)

First, head down and to the left.

**ZCell 126: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell126.png")

Obtain the *Transmitter*. Enter the zone to the north. There are some Xen Grunts selling stuff here.

!shop("Zone Zero Xen Grunts", ["Blast Powder", "Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Escape Rope"])

We'll need a few Blast Powders to progress, so ensure you have some. Use the PC star above to add an Electric type to your party. You'll need one, so catch a Helioptile out here if you don't have one yet. Audino will heal your team if you talk to it.

Enter the building and go down to the basement. You can hop across any single-spaced gaps, so do so to get to the right side of the map. Talk to the panel with your electric type to light it up.

**ZCell 127: Abandoned Apartments**

!img("zcell127.png")

After the short dialogue scene, enter the second door upstairs. Smash the rock and use the blast powder to talk to Aelita. You'll control her for a second: jump the two gaps and talk to the shining spot to get a key. As the player again, enter the rightmost room in the hallway. 

!battle(["Ernie",:BLADESTAR_M,0])

Go upstairs.

!battle(["Nic",:BLADESTAR_M,1])

Smash the rock in the second room from the left. Enter the door on the left in the hallway.

!battle(["Zyo",:BLADESTAR_M,1])

Beat the grunt then go up the ladder to talk to Aelita. As her again, parkour to the right and jump down the hole. Parkour down and to the right, then up. Interact with the bookshelf here to knock it over. As your character, enter the third door. Use Blast Powder, then as Aelita parkour to the right twice and use the panel. Continue upstairs.

!battle(["Tirgon",:BLADESTAR_M,1])

You'll then regain control of Aelita, so head back to the power room at the bottom.

!newself(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,0])

!battle(["Risa Raider",:POPSTAR,0])

You'll win if you just use Giga Drain with Cherrim, 2x Return with Golem.

Back as your character, head to the right and exit this building. Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard*, and enter the next building to the right. Once you enter, you'll fall to the Abandoned Depths! Once you're in the depths, heal with Audino, then talk to the crew and learn you can switch characters by pressing the A key. To progress in this area, I recommend this order:

- Ren: head right, then fly up and over the gap. Each gap is distinguished by an obvious indent in the floor. Follow this path to the second gap, then to the third. Head over to the left to the gap you can't cross.
- Aelita: push the boulder into the hole, then cross the gap to the right. Follow the path to the next gap and attempt to cross.
- Ren: approach the left gap and boost Aelita across. Then, navigate him all the way right to the stairs.
- Aelita: head to the right, dropping the second boulder. Navigate her to the stairs to the right.

Now your character can progress through the path, fighting grunts along the way.

!battle(["Nabeela",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Desert Field")

!battle(["Aurora",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Desert Field")

!battle(["Anette",:BLADESTAR_F,1], "Desert Field")

Once you've cleared the puzzle, heal with Audino and head to the right. After a scene, follow the stairs up and exit the building.

In this area, smash the two rocks to the left for easier backtracking and navigation.

Head down to the bottom to find:

**ZCell 128: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell128.png")

Head up and to the right. In the bottom corner of this area, grab *TM93 Wild Charge*. To the right down a narrow path is a shining *Zone Zero Key*, which unlocks the door between Alamissa Urben and Zone Zero. At the Lux Apartments, head up and right to grab a *Rare Candy* and hidden *Revive*.

!battle(["Shane",:BLADESTAR_M,1], "Desert Field")

Loop around to the left for an *Ultra Potion*, then go up along the upper path to get a *Razor Claw*. Down to the left is a hidden *Red Shard*. 

!battle(["Romario",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Desert Field")

Go into the building in the top left of the area. Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard* in a bookshelf, and enter the backroom. Go downstairs and power on the generator with the Electric Type. Enter the newly opened room and read the book with Ren, then exit this building and enter the one below it.

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and enter Nymiera's old house. Go to the basement to click the lever. Approach the top of the Zone Zero area.

!battle(["Lorna",:ROGPSYCHIC,0], "Psychic Terrain")

Lorna is often able to get off her 8-Turn Trick Room in this fight, allowing her slow Pokemon to outspeed. Psychic Terrain also nullifies priority moves, so you can't simply use those. You'll need to make a plan for Trick Room somehow: Taunt, Fake Out, simply one-shotting Aromatisse are all options that can assist with it. You can also use a super slow team of your own to take advantage. I recommend knocking out Aromatisse and stalling: once the screens and the trick room go away, you'll have a much easier time taking out the rest of her team.

## Zone Zero North

Head up and to the right down a little path. Defeat Mandibuzz, and pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard*. Then follow the path around to the top left of the area, pick up a hidden *Red Shard*, then talk to Ren then the cracked rock.

Head up and to the left to get a *Data Drive* and a battle with **Skarmory**. Follow the path to the right and enter the building. Go downstairs and read the journal, then head upstairs and exit.

Go left for a hidden *Red Shard*, then go right to the Pokemon Center area. After the scene, grab the *Full Restore* below. Activate a Braviary Post here, then go into the Center and talk to the crew.

After a few cutscenes, you'll get to play as Melia. All you must do is follow the path through this area but be prepared for a battle!

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,2])

!partner(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,4])

!battle(["Amanda",:TRAINER_AMANDA,3], "Factory Field")

A 12V6 battle sounds super easy, but you still have to watch out for Amanda's Trick Room shenanigans. Madelis' Houndoom can nearly one shot all the Pokemon that resist its Heat Wave under Torkoal's sun, so try to support it and you'll be just fine.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Complete *Housesitting* quest before this point (+2 Melia, +2 Erick)

We get to participate in a mech-battle sequence, with a more powerful Sakitron for completing *Housesitting* earlier. You don't have to necessarily win this one. If you do want to win, I recommend just using the attack she references in the text right before you attack - if she uses "hammer", "bash", "top", or "tank" in her text, you'll be able to know which to use.

Once you regain control as yourself once more, head left and up out of the center, then enter the now-opened gate area.

After a scene, go left:

**ZCell 129: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell129.png")

Also grab the *Fire Stone* above. Go down the stairs to the right. Pick up *Code Garna Rift Notes*. If you grabbed the Weird Diary in the past, now is another chance to use it to **Save Hippowdon**. Not doing so contributes (+10 Renegade Points).

!partner(["Ren",:OUTCAST,2])

!boss("RIFTHIPPOWDON", "Desert Field")

Ren is actually incredible here, probably better than the average team that you have at this point. For this reason moves that delay Hippowdon or attract attention onto your Pokemon are going to be helpful - the longer you can keep Ren's Flygon around, the better. 

You can literally loot a knocked out Bladestar grunt for an *Ability Capsule*! Head up and out. Take a peep at Team Xen HQ on Reldin Island, then head right and up to the next map. 

**ZCell 130: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell130.png")

Head up and to the left for one more cutscene.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sure! (Ren +1, Aelita +1)
- Define "okay". (Ren +2, Aelita +2)

Activate another Braviary Post, then head up.

## Eclysia Pyramid

After the scene, enter the pyramid above. You'll watch another, then on the left you'll find:

**ZCell 131: Eclysia Pyramid**

!img("zcell131.png")

Enter the spring at the top and watch the scenes play out. Next, we're going to begin the crawl to the top, so enter the room at the right side of the lobby and head up. Enter the... GameBoy?

After a conversation in the AteBit Kingdom, exit through the GameBoy on the left and go up.

!battle(["Partario",:BLADESTAR_M,1], "Blessed Field")

Jump through the pink GameBoy to reach the SyxtenBit Cave.

!enc(521, ["Cave"])

Follow the path outside and into the next GameBoy to reemerge in the Pyramid.

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,0], "Blessed Field")

Enter the green GameBoy.

!enc(460)

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,2], "Glitch Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat these mechs (+1 Allen)

Exit the GameBoy and proceed to enter the next GameBoy in the pyramid. Climb the castle.

!battle(["ALLEN",:JOHTO_1,1], "Glitch Field")

Outside, your Normality Badge will transform into the *Enigmatic Key*! Proceed to the next room.

For the first fight:

!partner(["Huey",:OPTKID,1])

!dbattle(["Geofrey",:BLADESTAR_M1,0], ["Natalie",:BLADESTAR_F1,0], "Factory Field")

For the second fight:

!partner(["Reina",:TRENDYGIRL,1])

!dbattle(["Jones",:BLADESTAR_M1,0], ["Elayne",:BLADESTAR_F1,0], "Factory Field")

For the third fight:

!partner(["Ren",:OUTCAST,3])

!dbattle(["Maltus",:BLADESTAR_M1,0], ["Nichola",:BLADESTAR_F1,0], "Factory Field")

Progress through the area. In the room with the healing star, at the top:

**ZCell 132: Eclysia Pyramid**

!img("zcell132.png")

Emerge at the Eclysia Skyview.

## Do the Dive on Floria Island

So, I have a confession. Chapter 14 is incredibly awkward to route for a walkthrough, because we want to explore everything and progress sidequests as much as possible before getting each badge... but in this case, it's weird. See, we need the Enigmatic Key we got in the Pyramid to get some things, so we have to progress at least to that point before we can tackle the side areas. At the same time though, the main story has a ton of momentum going towards the events at the top of the Eclysia Pyramid. In this case, the game literally just told us we have like 18 minutes to go until our friends in the pods will die. We are going to just roll with the absurdity and do a few hours of sidequests now, though you can come back to them after the Pyramid events are concluded if you wish. You can use the purple teleporter on the right to exit the pyramid (and reenter the Skyview later).

Fly to the Evergreen Island first, and surf down onto Route 11. First thing we are going to do is go all the way up and right in the route, to the large mostly circular dive spot. Dive down to reach the *Evergreen Trench*. 

!enc(594)

Hidden here is a *Blue Shard* and *Damp Rock*. Interact with the submarine at the top to begin the sidequest in this area: to activate the underwater pillars, tallest to shortest.

Surface, then go straight down and dive in the blob-shaped dive spot. Down here is a hidden *Dive Ball*. Resurface.

Fly back to Evergreen Island (to save a few seconds of surfing) and surf right, then down. You'll find a 2x2 square to go down, where you'll find the tallest pillar. Interact with it to activate it with the Enigmatic Key.

Surface, and dive down in the main area of Route 11. This gargantuan area has lots of hidden items, including *4 Blue Shards*, *Revive*, *GourmetTreat*, *3 Heart Scales*, *Pearl*, *Sea Incense*, *Ultra Potion*, *Water Stone*, *Max Repel*, *Nugget*, *Dive Ball*, and *Green Shard*. Anyways, towards the southwest area of the map, you'll find a small 2x2 square to surface. Do so to grab *TM33 Reflect* and:

**ZCell 133: Route 11**

!img("zcell133.png")

Dive back down. Straight down from here at the bottom of this area you'll see a little tunnel you can go through. Do so and surface to nab *TM16 Light Screen*. Dive again and go left after exiting the tunnel to the north. Activate the taller pillar here.

Head straight to the right until you find another pillar. Activate it, then surface in the 2x2 square immediately to the right to get *Icicle Plate*. Dive down once more, and go up above the third pillar. Surface at this 2x2 square to grab the *Primarium-Z*!

Head back down, then go the the bottom-left-most corner. Below the taller pillar we already activated is the fourth pillar. Once the ground shakes, return to the submarine. After a conversation, surface, fly back to Evergreen, then dive right here and enter the door.

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,3], "Short-Circuit Field")

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,4], "Short-Circuit Field")

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,5], "Short-Circuit Field")

Once you reach the top, you'll be gifted the *Empoleon Crest*!

Before we exit the Akuwa area, head over to Route 4. Make your way towards Den 4: You’ll spot **Sobble** hiding in the water. Chase it a few times for a battle!

Cairo has a few more Crests for sale:

!shop("Cairo’s Shop New Items (13 Badges)", [["Boltund Crest", "9000 Red Essences"], ["Probopass Crest", "9000 Red Essences"], ["Swalot Crest", "9000 Red Essences"], ["Cinccino Crest", "9000 Red Essences"]])

### Shipwreck Recovery 2

Fly over to East Gearen and return to the Wreckage Site. We can actually complete the *Shipwreck Recovery* quest now that we can use Dive. Enter the S.S. Oceana Wreckage.

There is some *Luminous Moss* at the top of the entry room. Plant Device 1 here, on the X symbol. Heading to the right you'll be attacked by Sharpedo. Enter a bedroom, pick up 5 *Dive Balls*, then follow the path. Pick up a *Water Stone* in the room next to you upstairs, then beat the next Sharpedo. More *Luminous Moss* is hidden here. A room to the left will contain the *Sharpedonite*! Plant Device 2 in here. To the right, beat another shark then follow the path to pick up *5 Dive Balls*. Exit to the right for 5 *Luxury Balls* and the spot for Device 3, then exit to the left to find a shining *Key* and the spot for Device 4. A door at the top to the left leads you to a *Dawn Stone* as well as *3 Pearls* hidden, plus the spot for Device 5. Finally, head up the stairs here and you'll have a chance to battle and catch **Mareanie**! Catch two/three for the Aquarium Quest. Plant Device 6 here! Exit the ship the same way we came in.

Surface, and Adrienn will give you the *Alcremite*! Use the key we found earlier to enter the warehouse on the left. Inside is the *Lycanium-Z*!

Return to the Help Center in East Gearen to get $15000 (+1 Karma).

### Continuing Reborn Again

We can continue the Reborn Crossover quest, *Reborn Again*, after finishing all the Neo Gearen Help Quests.

Follow Aya to Venam's gym.

!battle(["Aya",:WPUNK,0], "Corrupted Field")

Aya's team is built for the Corrupted Field this time around, different from both Venam and Aya in Reborn. Field Hazard damage runs rampant here - watch out for Tentacruel's Seed + Speed strategy and the hard hitting bulky mons she has hiding in the back.

Beating Aya is all we can do in this quest for now!

### Aquarium Quest 2

We can now finally finish the Aquarium Collection Sidequest. The last ten Pokemon we need to donate are the following:

- Mareanie/**Toxapex**: S.S. Oceana Wreckage (Evolve one)
- Clawitzer: Goldenwood Park Fishing
- Starmie: Valor Mountain Fishing
- Lanturn: Darchlight Village Fishing
- Relicanth: Terajuma Coral Reef Static
- Cloyster: Goldenwood Park Fishing
- Walrein: Route 11 Fishing
- **Huntail**: Evolve one Clamperl (DeepSeaTooth + Link Heart)
- **Gorebyss**: Evolve one Clamperl (DeepSeaScale + Link Heart)

For submitting all 34, you'll get $80000 as well as **Froakie** (+3 Karma)!

## Do the Dive on Terajuma Island

Fly over to Helojak Island and enter the Helojak Factory. There's a big dive spot in the main room - head down it to grab *TM112 Smart Strike* as well as **Shadow Amaura**! Use the teleporter to get out.

Next, fly to Teila Resort, and enter Aquamarine Cave. Make your way to the Aquamarine Chamber by pushing the floating rocks into place. Dive down in this area.

We're going to need to activate a few panels in this area by floating over them, so follow this sequence:

- Step on the 1st panel immediately above the dive spot.
- Go straight down, then straight right. Activate the 2nd panel in this new area.
- Go up as much as possible, then left. In this area, go left from the up-most position such that you go up to the northmost area. Activate the 3rd panel.
- Go left, then down on the right tile of the two. In this small gap, head down and activate the fourth panel.

Make your way back to the top left side of this underwater maze, then hug the left and bottom walls to exit to the Mynori Coral Reef!

!enc(278)

In this area, grab the *Water Memory*, then use the Enigmatic Key on the pillar. Go down the ledge... though I don't know how a ledge works underwater, but whatever. Pick up the hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Stardust* as you go right. Surface at the bottom right to emerge onto Route 5, then go up to dive down at a new spot. You can find hidden *Pearl*, *Star Piece*, *Black Prism*, and a *Protein* here. Enter the Archives on the right side.

Read the lore on the green-tinted bookshelves, then grab the *Zangoose Crest* and the *Ariados Crest*.

Back in the reef, if you head up, you can talk to Challenger Neptune for a tough battle!

!battle(["Neptune",:CHALLENGER,0], "Underwater Field")

Our first trainer battle on Underwater Field, and she does not mess around!
This one is tough at first as she uses the Underwater Field well. In general, your non-water types will have their speed quartered on this field, which is obviously not good since so many of her Pokemon can hit really hard with field boosted moves. Whiscash is dangerous here, as it has no weaknesses (except Water itself, on the Underwater Field) and surely can set up on you if you can't take it out in time. Luckily, if either Samurott or Whiscash uses Dive, the field will be returned to water surface, at least allowing you to not suffer so much speed loss. Her Raichu is devastating, as Surf and Discharge are both boosted by the field here, and it's given double speed by Surge Surfer. Dhelmise is good on this field as well.

One great idea is to use your own water types as soon as Raichu and Dhelmise go down, as they suffer no speed loss and can take advantage of the field to hit Whiscash super-effectively and fight back against Samurott and Blastoise. Alternatively this is one of the field effects that is fairly easily changed: the Water Surface field or better yet the Icy Field or Murkwater Field can help tip the scales.

Win against Neptune to get the fourth *Star Shard*, **Popplio**, and a *Somniam Mall Stamp*.

While we're in this area, surface at the top to enter Aquamarine Cave's Secluded Shore. Use Blast Powder to reach **Squirtle** on the left.

Next, fly to Valor Mountain. Use the blue crystal and make your way to the Chamber of Awakening at the bottom. Dive down where we may or may not have fought Kyogre, then follow the path to the left and grab ZCrystal *Waterium-Z*. Take JUST ONE set of currents to the left, then go up and to the right. Activate this fifth panel, prepare for battle, and head up through the now-opened door.

!battle(["Kingdra",:POKEGANG8,0], "Underwater Field")

Another tough Underwater Field battle, but like Neptune, field changes and/or your own Water types is the way to go!

Once you've won, head up to catch a Horsea. A weird prize considering we got Horsea a long time ago... but ok. To the left is the familiar part of the maze - exit to Aquamarine Chamber or Mynori Coral Reef.

## Do the Dive on Terrial Island

We can take care of some more quests and exploration on Terrial Island next. Head to where we fought Souta behind the Rose Theater to get the *Pidgeotite*!

### Kingdom of Goomidra

There's another major side quest we can do: *The Hero of Slime*. Enter Honec Woods and make your way to the upper right-hand corner. Dive down here.

!enc(599)

Emerge at the top into the Kingdom of Goomidra. Hidden around town is *2 Red Shards* and a *Tiny Mushroom*. Speaking of mushrooms: there is a tutor Goomy that accepts them:

!tutor("Goomidra Village Tutor", [["Body Slam", "2 Big Mushrooms"], ["Seed Bomb", "2 Big Mushrooms"], ["Dragon Pulse", "3 Big Mushrooms"], ["Megahorn", "3 Big Mushrooms"], ["Scorching Sands", "3 Big Mushrooms"], ["Zen Headbutt", "2 Big Mushrooms"], ["Liquidation", "3 Big Mushrooms"], ["Muddy Water", "2 Big Mushrooms"], ["Defog", "1 Big Mushroom"], ["Dual Wingbeat", "2 Big Mushrooms"]])

We don't have enough Big Mushrooms outright to learn all these moves, so you'll need to grind wild Paras/Foongus/Shroomish/Morelull for them.

In the top right area of the town, grab *3 Pecha Berries*, *2 Lum Berries*, *3 Starf Berries*, *2 Enigma Berries*, and *2 Aspear Berries*.

Enter the castle at the top, then talk to Goomelda in her room. Exit the castle afterwards, then talk to Goomink in an upper left house of the village. At the top of the village, fight and beat Goomink!

!battle(["Goomink",:HERO,0], "Swamp Field")

Fly over to East Gearen after he leaves. Enter Venam's gym, and head to the back. Fight Aya with Goomink.

!newself(["Goomink",:HERO,6])

!battle(["Aya",:WPUNK,1], "Concert Venue")

After winning, head outside the gym and talk to Goomink, then fly to Kakori Village. Head down to Crawli's arena and talk to Goomink here.

!newself(["Goomink",:HERO,1])

!battle(["Crawli",:LEADER_CRAWLI,1], "Concert Venue")

Fight Goomy once you're outside the gym again. 

!battle(["Goomink",:HERO,1], "Forest Field")

Fly to Sashila, then the Zorrialyn Coast to the south. Talk to Goomy, then after the conversation head to the dock on the east side of the village. Talk to the guy and bring the yacht (since when in V13.5 did we have a yacht??).

!partner(["Goomink",:HERO,2])

!boss("KAWOPUDUNGA", "Underwater Field")

Quite the tough boss. Kawopudunga gets stat boosts each time its shield breaks, which on top of Sitrus Berry replenishment, Water Veil, and stat drop cures means that it is hard to take out. Goomink as an ally is fairly weak but can deal super effective damage, so keeping it alive can be very advantageous. 

Changing its ability or the field and applying a status condition will help out tremendously in this fight. Using a move like Topsy Turvy or Haze to turn off its boosts is a generally good idea as well. Otherwise, field-boosted Electric moves are generally going to be the way to go here. (Or, you can use Spore 24 turns in a row and let Goomink do all the work. Heroic!)

!newself(["Goomink",:HERO,7])

!battle(["Ann",:TEAMAA_F,1])

Afterwards, fly back to the Kingdom of Goomidra. Make your way to the castle and battle the grunts as you go up. 

!newself(["Goomink",:HERO,3])

!battle(["Pech",:TEAMAA_F,1])

After this:

!partner(["Goomink",:HERO,3])

!dbattle(["Mikael",:TEAMAA_M,0], ["Drew",:TEAMAA_M,1])

Two more:

!newself(["Goomink",:HERO,4])

!battle(["Sisi",:TEAMAA_F,0])

!battle(["Emi",:TEAMAA_F,0])

At the top:

!partner(["Goomink",:HERO,3])

!battle(["Genri",:TEAMAA_M,0])

After the events at the top of the tower, head back to the throne room, and talk to the king. You'll get the *Swampertite* and *Infernape Crest*!

Head down the hallway to the right, into the ruins room.

!newself(["Goomink",:HERO,4])

!boss("BIGBETTY", "Flower Garden Field")

King's Shield and Aqua Cutter will go a long way here.

!newself(["Goomink",:HERO,5])

!boss("BIGBETTYTWO", "Flower Garden Field")

Yet again King's Shield and Aqua Cutter slay

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Finish the Hero of Slime quest (+6 Ben, +6 Goomink, +5 Karma)

After these events, re-enter the ruins room. While here, grab *TM08 Bulk Up* and hidden *BalmMushroom*.

!enc(602)

You can also exit the castle out of the southwest entrance to find some grass, with a hidden *Dusk Ball* and *Big Mushroom* nearby.

!enc(600)

In the house with the tutor, we can now buy some crests:

!shop("Goomidra Crest Shop", [["Bastiodon Crest", 100000], ["Dedenne Crest", 100000], ["Rampardos Crest", 100000], ["Whiscash Crest", 100000]])

## Castle Zygara

Our next quest takes place on the Badlands. Fly to Alamissa Urben and go straight up. Take the unconscious Karen back to the village, then agree to go to the labyrinth again. 

Add any Water/Rock type to your party and head to the Zorrialyn Labyrinth. Make your way to the third floor just as we did before:

!img("labyrinth_1_3.png")

!img("labyrinth_2_2.png")

Now we can progress on the third level:

**B3F Trip 3: Progress**:

!img("labyrinth_3_3.png")

(1) Talk to the sign and present a Water/Rock type 
(2) Dive down

**B4F Trip 1: Items**:

!img("labyrinth_4_1.png")

(1) *Relic Silver*
(2) *Mind Plate*
(3) *Calcium*
(4) *Skuntank Crest*
(5) *Heart Scale*
(6) *Heart Scale*
(7) *Relic Silver*
(8) *Blue Shard*
(9) *Kinglerite*
(10) *Relicanth Crest*
(11) *Splash Plate*
(12) *Pixie Plate*
(13) *Full Restore*
(14) *PP Up*
(15) *Dread Plate*
(16) *Water Stone*

It is worth noting that we exploit the very weird way this area is coded internally: simply entering the room (9) containing the Kinglerite causes the step counter to completely reset. This allows us to get all the above items in one pass. Once you get all the items, enter and exit this room (9) once more before we solve the puzzle to proceed.

**B4F Trip 2: Progress**:

!img("labyrinth_4_2.png")

(1) Defeat the four Luvdisc on this map
(2) Exit at the bottom 

Note that the first time you catch the Luvdisc in the bottom left, it will be holding the *Luvdisc Crest*!

Grab the *Zap Plate* and surface. Then, use dive in the sandy spot here. Attempt to grab the item ball.

!boss("BOSSCOFAGRIGUS", "Haunted Field")

I had a really really hard time on this fight for some reason, for lots of reasons. Cofagrigus is fairly slow but gets kills easily with field boosted Shadow Ball. It gets stat boosts, new items, and really busted partners with every shield break, so it's pretty hard to stay ahead of all of its shenanigans. Priority moves can help you with Crest Magcargo if it comes out, though I recommend doing everything in your power to neuter Stantler but leave it alive while you focus on taking out Cofagrigus, so you don't ever need to see the molten menace (or Leafeon).

Get the *Cofagrigus Crest*!

Afterwards, head to the top of this map and enter the door on top with the incantation. Head up to enter Castle Zygara, and agree to help Karen.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yeah, sure why not? (Karen +1)
- Maybe tomorrow. (Karen -1)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Leave Castle Zygara while Karen is your partner (-1 Karen)

!partner(["Karen",:ELITE_KAREN,0])

!battle(["Layla",:TEAMAA_F,1], "Blessed Field")

Head up the stairs to the left.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Find the purple bookcase secret while Karen is following you (+2 Karen)

Follow the secret path through said bookshelf to find an *Eviolite* and the *Claydol Crest*. Backtrack and exit to the second floor. To the right is a grunt.

!battle(["Peridot",:TEAMAA_F,1], "Blessed Field")

Enter the door on the right to get the *Darmanitan Crest*. Go down the stairs to the left. Follow this path to a door to grab the *Spiritomb Crest*.  Further along this path, step on the blue tile. Make your way back to the first floor toward the entrance, and exit out the rightmost door. 

!battle(["Malachite",:TEAMAA_M,1], "Blessed Field")

Step on the green tile and step on the teleporter. Make your way back to 2F. Cross the bridge near the AA grunt. Take the stairs at the left to reach the *Torterra Crest*. Back downstairs, go straight up and follow this path all the way through until the top of the castle. After a scene, start heading down the castle. After two sets of stairs, you'll notice a cave has opened at the top, so head in to catch **Larvesta**!

Climb the stairs to the left as soon as you can.

!battle(["Karrina",:GANGLEADER,0], "Blessed Field")

A formidable team, but nothing you can't handle. If you let Alakazam or crest Fearow come out while the rest of your surviving team is too slow/weak to take them out, you're gonna be hurting a lot in this one. You also must watch out for Durant, who will surprise you with a speedy Continental Crush.

Afterwards, you'll get a choice: to *Intervene against Karrina*, or *Let Karrina Kill Karen*. 

### Let Karrina Kill Karen

Completing this option causes (-5 Karma, +10 Renegade Points).

You can now head to the top of Castle Zygara for another choice: whether to **Push Karrina** or not. Doing so grants another (+20 Renegade Points).

After either option of this second choice, you'll be able to get the *Banettite* or the *Heracronite*, whichever you didn't get earlier.

### Intervene Against Karrina

For making this choice, you can fly to the Zone Zero Outskirts, head down into Alamissa Urben, and enter a door all the way on the left, accessed via the top left side of the area. Grab the *Life Orb*! You can also read the journal.

In either case, with all the crests that we found in the crypt, fly to Sashila and talk to the Archeologist to the left for some lore, and the *Dusknoir Crest*!


## Pyramid Point Badge

With all that content wrapped up in less than 18 minutes in game, clearly.... we now proceed to the top of Eclysia Pyramid. Take a Braviary over to the Pyramid and return to the top.

!battle(["Flora",:LEADER_RYLAND,0], "Desert Field")

!move("DESERTSMARK")

Most of Rejuvenation's fields have something you can exploit, something that you can do to either change the field or effectively steal its benefits for your own use. Unfortunately, Desert Field is not really one of these, as you cannot change it to any other field directly by moves. The Desert Field grants all Ground types a free 1.5x in Special Defense. Additionally, Dig comes out in just one turn and is boosted to 120 base power, so it's an even stronger STAB Earthquake. Ryland's team is very strong on the Desert Field: on top of default Sandstorm (not as bad as Strong Winds...) and two Crest-enhanced Pokemon, you're gonna really need to think outside the box to win this one.

Let's look at the team. 

- Nidoqueen is hard to take out and punishes you for immediately trying out your own Ground types thanks to its Shuca Berry plus Ice Beam. It can lay Toxic Spikes if you attempt to set up on it as well. 
- Claydol has a crest which makes its special attacks stronger and makes Hyper Beam not need a recharge turn. It's Arenite Wall, also on Torterra and Golisopod, is always enabled, which makes his team even more hard to kill. 
- Gliscor gets Bulk and Speed thanks to its seed and can hit hard with Dig and full-power Acrobatics.
- Torterra is annoying for a different reason: its crest swaps its resistances and weaknesses: say goodbye to 4x Ice, Fire, Bug, Flying and say hello to... just Rock and Ground, which it hits with Grass super effectively anyways. Its Desert Mark applies a Sand Tomb-like effect on top of changing your Pokemon's typing to Ground, an effect you *can* exploit but takes away your STAB and changes your weaknesses.
- Golisopod's Aevian Form is very slow, but is very tanky and hits incredibly hard with its wide array of Skill Link moves.
- Excadrill has Sand Rush... once deemed so good it had to be banned from Smogon competitive play. On Desert Field this ability is always on, so get ready to be outsped and oneshotted via Dig or Rock Slide.

Let's look at some strategies. Sun is a very good choice for this fight: it lasts eight turns and can boost the already boosted Heat Wave and Burn Up. Rain can potentially work too as Scald gets a 1.5x boost. You also may get some success by simply copying what Ryland is doing: send in your own tanky Ground types with Telluric Seeds and see what havoc they can wreak. You'll get all the benefits of Dig, Bone moves, Needle Arm, Sand Tomb, etc. too!

After the battle, head down to talk to the group. Make sure you heal up and save, because there's more... Head back up.

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,1])

!dbattle(["???",:UNKNOWN_1,2], ["???",:UNKNOWN_2,0], "Desert Field")

There is a catch with this one, see if you can spot it.

!newself(["Adam",:LEADER_ADAM,1])

!battle(["???",:UNKNOWN_2,1], "Desert Field")

Defeat ??? with the combined power of Delpha and Adam!

That's it for this bit, the spring will turn lush and green! If only this could've happened earlier to nullify the Desert Field! Anyways, go ahead and approach the spring when you can. You'll get the Pyramid Point Badge and *TM105 Arenite Wall*!

You'll wake up back in the Dream Complex. Talk to Melia on the couch to complete Chapter 14!
