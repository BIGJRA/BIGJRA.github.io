# Chapter 14: Death of One, Birth of Another

You'll find yourself in New Game with Zetta again. Start the game, then talk to the characters. Talk next to the black piece below.

## Nastasia's Ship

Talk to the group in the meeting room of Nastasia's ship.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Fine... (+2 Aelita, +3 Ren)
- There's no way. (-2 Ren)

Head to the right.

After another conversation, you can talk to Sharon for a battle against the duo. 

!battle(["Eli and Sharon",:MISFORTUNATEDUO,15], "Factory Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Eli and Sharon on the airship (+2 Ren, +2 Aelita).

Head up the stairs and talk to Nastasia and Ren. Follow her into the room on the right, then go back downstairs.

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,0])

!dbattle(["Dustin",:XENGRUNT_M,0], ["Yasmine",:XENANALYST_F,0])

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Win this battle (+1 Aelita)

Accept Aelita's request for story time.

!newself(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,0])

As soon as you get control, head over to the spot on the left side of the arena when you are ready!

!battle(["Texen",:LEADER_TEXEN,1], "Forest Field")

Aelita's team makes this one a breeze. I recommend starting with Cherrim and Starmie - these two are fast and strong and clean up most of his team easily.

Afterwards, you'll get the *Cherrim Crest*. Tell Aelita you want to rest for a while once you're ready. Head outside the airship when you wake up!

## Zone Zero South

!enc(573)

First, head down and to the left.

**ZCell 126: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell126.png")

Obtain the *Transmitter*. Enter the zone to the north. There are some Xen Grunts selling stuff here.

!shop("Zone Zero Xen Grunts", ["Blast Powder", "Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Escape Rope"])

We'll need a few Blast Powders to progress, so ensure you have some. Use the PC star above to add an Electric type to your party. You'll need one, so catch a Helioptile out here if you don't have one yet. Audino will heal your team if you talk to it.

Enter the building and go down to the basement. You can hop across any single-spaced gaps, so do so to get to the right side of the map. Talk to the panel with your electric type to light it up.

**ZCell 127: Abandoned Apartments**

!img("zcell127.png")

After the short dialogue scene, enter the second door upstairs. Smash the rock and use the blast powder to talk to Aelita. You'll control her for a second: jump the two gaps and talk to the shining spot to get a key. As the player again, enter the rightmost room in the hallway. 

!battle(["Ernie",:BLADESTAR_M,0])

Go upstairs.

!battle(["Nic",:BLADESTAR_M,1])

Smash the rock in the second room from the left. Enter the door on the left in the hallway.

!battle(["Zyo",:BLADESTAR_M,1])

Beat the grunt then go up the ladder to talk to Aelita. As her again, parkour to the right and jump down the hole. Parkour down and to the right, then up. Interact with the bookshelf here to knock it over. As your character, enter the third door. Use Blast Powder, then as Aelita parkour to the right twice and use the panel. Continue upstairs.

!battle(["Tirgon",:BLADESTAR_M,1])

You'll then regain control of Aelita, so head back to the power room at the bottom.

!newself(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,0])

!battle(["Risa Raider",:POPSTAR,0])

You'll win if you just use Giga Drain with Cherrim, 2x Return with Golem.

Back as your character, head to the right and exit this building. Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard*, and enter the next building to the right. Once you enter, you'll fall to the Abandoned Depths! Once you're in the depths, heal with Audino, then talk to the crew and learn you can switch characters by pressing the A key. To progress in this area, I recommend this order:

- Ren: head right, then fly up and over the gap. Each gap is distinguished by an obvious indent in the floor. Follow this path to the second gap, then to the third. Head over to the left to the gap you can't cross.
- Aelita: push the boulder into the hole, then cross the gap to the right. Follow the path to the next gap and attempt to cross.
- Ren: approach the left gap and boost Aelita across. Then, navigate him all the way right to the stairs.
- Aelita: head to the right, dropping the second boulder. Navigate her to the stairs to the right.

Now your character can progress through the path, fighting grunts along the way.

!battle(["Nabeela",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Desert Field")

!battle(["Aurora",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Desert Field")

!battle(["Anette",:BLADESTAR_F,1], "Desert Field")

Once you've cleared the puzzle, heal with Audino and head to the right. After a scene, follow the stairs up and exit the building.

In this area, smash the two rocks to the left for easier backtracking and navigation.

Head down to the bottom to find:

**ZCell 128: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell128.png")

Head up and to the right. In the bottom corner of this area, grab *TM93 Wild Charge*. To the right down a narrow path is a shining *Zone Zero Key*, which unlocks the door between Alamissa Urben and Zone Zero. At the Lux Apartments, head up and right to grab a *Rare Candy* and hidden *Revive*.

!battle(["Shane",:BLADESTAR_M,1], "Desert Field")

Loop around to the left for an *Ultra Potion*, then go up along the upper path to get a *Razor Claw*. Down to the left is a hidden *Red Shard*. 

!battle(["Romario",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Desert Field")

Go into the building in the top left of the area. Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard* in a bookshelf, and enter the backroom. Go downstairs and power on the generator with the Electric Type. Enter the newly opened room and read the book with Ren, then exit this building and enter the one below it.

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and enter Nymiera's old house. Go to the basement to click the lever. Approach the top of the Zone Zero area.

!battle(["Lorna",:ROGPSYCHIC,0], "Psychic Terrain")

Lorna is often able to get off her 8-Turn Trick Room in this fight, allowing her slow Pokemon to outspeed. Psychic Terrain also nullifies priority moves, so you can't simply use those. You'll need to make a plan for Trick Room somehow: Taunt, Fake Out, simply one-shotting Aromatisse are all options that can assist with it. You can also use a super slow team of your own to take advantage. I recommend knocking out Aromatisse and stalling: once the screens and the trick room go away, you'll have a much easier time taking out the rest of her team.

## Zone Zero North

Head up and to the right down a little path. Defeat Mandibuzz, and pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard*. Then follow the path around to the top left of the area, pick up a hidden *Red Shard*, then talk to Ren then the cracked rock.

Head up and to the left to get a *Data Drive* and a battle with **Skarmory**. Follow the path to the right and enter the building. Go downstairs and read the journal, then head upstairs and exit.

Go left for a hidden *Red Shard*, then go right to the Pokemon Center area. After the scene, grab the *Full Restore* below. Activate a Braviary Post here, then go into the Center and talk to the crew.

After a few cutscenes, you'll get to play as Melia. All you must do is follow the path through this area but be prepared for a battle!

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,2])

!partner(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,4])

!battle(["Amanda",:TRAINER_AMANDA,3], "Factory Field")

A 12V6 battle sounds super easy, but you still have to watch out for Amanda's Trick Room shenanigans. Madelis' Houndoom can nearly one shot all the Pokemon that resist its Heat Wave under Torkoal's sun, so try to support it and you'll be just fine.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Complete *Housesitting* quest before this point (+2 Melia, +2 Erick)

We get to participate in a mech-battle sequence, with a more powerful Sakitron for completing *Housesitting* earlier. You don't have to necessarily win this one. If you do want to win, I recommend just using the attack she references in the text right before you attack - if she uses "hammer", "bash", "top", or "tank" in her text, you'll be able to know which to use.

Once you regain control as yourself once more, head left and up out of the center, then enter the now-opened gate area.

After a scene, go left:

**ZCell 129: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell129.png")

Also grab the *Fire Stone* above. Go down the stairs to the right. Pick up *Code Garna Rift Notes*. If you grabbed the Weird Diary in the past, now is another chance to use it!

!partner(["Ren",:OUTCAST,2])

!boss("RIFTHIPPOWDON", "Desert Field")

Ren is actually incredible here, probably better than the average team that you have at this point. For this reason moves that delay Hippowdon or attract attention onto your Pokemon are going to be helpful - the longer you can keep Ren's Flygon around, the better. 

You can literally loot a knocked out Bladestar grunt for an *Ability Capsule*! Head up and out. Take a peep at Team Xen HQ on Reldin Island, then head right and up to the next map. 

**ZCell 130: Zone Zero**

!img("zcell130.png")

Head up and to the left for one more cutscene.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sure! (Ren +1, Aelita +1)
- Define "okay". (Ren +2, Aelita +2)

Activate another Braviary Post, then head up.

## Eclysia Pyramid

After the scene, enter the pyramid above. You'll watch another, then on the left you'll find:

ZCell 131: Eclysia Pyramid

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image105.png"/>

Enter the spring at the top and watch the scenes play out. Next, we're going to begin the crawl to the top, so enter the room at the right side of the lobby and head up.

We get control of Aelita and Ren again. The following is the sequence that will get us through the first section:
-   As Aelita, battle the goon and click the blue switch.
-   As Ren, head down, then click the green switch.
-   As Aelita, position yourself above the green bridge in the middle.
-   As MC, head up and battle the grunt, then click the blue switch.
-   As Ren, head back up and go all the way up and right.
-   As Aelita, head up and stand on the red switch here.
-   As Ren, pass the red bridge and beat the grunt. Wait in this area.
-   As Aelita, step off the switch and position yourself down below the
    blue bridge.
-   As Ren, step on the green switch.
-   As MC, walk up past the green bridge as far as it will let you go.
-   As Aelita, walk past the green switch and press the blue switch.
-   As Ren, walk up and stand on the red switch.
-   As Aelita, walk as far up as it will let you go.
-   As Ren, head up as far as you can
-   Return to control of the MC and head up for a battle!

While the battle may seem tough, they're just slightly beefed-up Magneton and Claydol. We'll be fighting more of these throughout the tower, but they aren't too tough. Every mech we will face has Steel as their primary type.

Now, onto the second part of the puzzle:
-   As MC, walk up and stand on the red switch.
-   As Ren, head right and fight the defense mechanism. The outcome
    affects relationship points: Winning grants (+1 Allen), losing
    grants (-1 Allen).
-   As Aelita, head up and fight the defense mechanism. The outcome
    affects relationship points: Winning grants (+1 Allen), losing
    grants (-1 Allen). Then, head all the way up to click the blue
    switch.
-   As Ren, cross the first blue bridge and head all the way up to stand
    next to the blue switch in the upper right area. Make sure you're on
    the left side of the bridge that leads to the red switch.
-   As Aelita, cross the blue bridge at the left, go left, down, left,
    and click the green switch.
-   As MC, cross the green bridge and wait in this area.
-   As Ren, click the blue switch, then cross to the right and stand on
    the red switch.
-   As Aelita, go all the way to the right, across the red and purple
    bridges until you can't go further.
-   As MC, head up past the red bridge and wait there.
-   As Ren, head all the way to the left until you can't go further.
-   Finally, as MC go up and rendezvous!

Head up and follow the path... after another scene, it's time for another mech battle!!!!!

Luckily this is the same deal as before, I guided Allen to victory by doing the attack the grunt mentioned in their dialogue before our turn. It is optional, but the outcome affects relationship points: winning grants (+5 Allen, +5 Alice), losing grants (-3 Allen, -3 Alice).

After some interesting scenes, head up to battle some goons. You'll be tag-teamed with the other characters here -- these fights aren't too tough.

After... that, head up and follow the path. In general, the next few rooms are straightforward progression, talking to characters as necessary. You'll also find this, in the room with hoverboard dude:

ZCell 102: Eclysia Pyramid

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image106.png"/>

Emerge at the Eclysia Skyview!

## Pyramid Point Badge

Forgotten Prince ~~Ryland~~ Flora (Desert Field)
-   Nidoqueen, Level 84. @ Shuca Berry.
    -   Toxic Spikes
    -   Earth Power
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Ice Beam
-   Claydol, Level 85. @ Claydol Crest.
    -   Arenite Wall
    -   Ice Beam
    -   Earth Power
    -   Hyper Beam
-   Gliscor, Level 84. @ Telluric Seed.
    -   Desert's Mark
    -   Roost
    -   Dig
    -   Acrobatics
-   Camerupt, Level 85. @ Cameruptite.
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Earth Power
    -   Hidden Power Ice
    -   Rock Slide
-   Torterra, Level 87. @ Torterra Crest.
    -   Desert's Mark
    -   Wood Hammer
    -   Arenite Wall
    -   Dig
-   Excadrill, Level 85. @ Life Orb.
    -   X-Scissor
    -   Dig
    -   Iron Head
    -   Rock Slide

Desert's Mark: Changes the target into a Ground-type and inflicts them with Sand Tomb \| On Desert Field, Sand Tomb deals 1/6 max HP per turn
(up from 1/8).

Most of Rejuvenation's fields have something you can exploit, something that you can do to either change the field or effectively steal its benefits for your own use. Unfortunately, Desert Field is not really one of these, as you cannot change it to any other field directly by moves, and there is no type whose attacks are boosted directly. On top of default Sandstorm (not as bad as Strong Wind, thankfully) you're gonna really need to think outside the box to defeat our buddy Ryland. Or is it Flora?

Anyways, one of the biggest pitfalls this field throws at you is that it gives all Ground types a free 1.5x in Special Defense. Pretty annoying because it means that you're gonna need to more heavily rely on physical attacks even though many of his team members are very defensive. Additionally, Dig comes out in just one turn and is boosted to 120 base power, so it's an even stronger STAB Earthquake.

Nidoqueen is the only Pokemon here that doesn't really have insane synergy with the field and weather other than this boost - even then it melts your tanky dreams by laying Toxic Spikes or piercing you with mixed Sheer Force offense. His Claydol has a crest which notably makes its special attack stronger and makes Hyper Beam not need a recharge turn, which means it hits hard. Arenite Wall on this, Torterra, and Gliscor can always come out, even if you change the weather on them, which makes his team even more hard to kill. Gliscor, particularly with its seed, is super annoying, because not only can it tank your attacks and heal, but also hit hard with Dig and 110 base Acrobatics. Torterra on the other hand is annoying for a different reason: its crest swaps its resistances and weaknesses: say goodbye to 4x Ice, Fire, Bug, Flying and say hello to... just Rock and Ground, which it hits super effectively anyways. It and Torterra's Desert Mark attack turns your typing to Ground and fixes Sand Tomb on you as well, particularly useful for Torterra as the next turn it can use super effective Wood Hammer. Mega Camerupt also hits like a truck, especially if you take advantage of free 8 turn Sun on the field and will almost certainly one-shot most things with boosted Heat Wave. And finally, there is Sand Rush Excadrill, once deemed so good it had to be banned from competitive play. Since then, sand has gotten nerfs here and there and it's not too bad - after all, if you can switch weather, it's back to normal base 88 speed... right? On this field Sand Rush is always on so it will almost always outspeed you and will murder with Dig or Rock Slide.

So, as I hinted at earlier, Sun can be viable here, since Heat Wave and Burn Up are boosted on the field, and it lasts for 8 turns no matter what. This means you can slap a Telluric Seed, Air Balloon or something else on your sun setter and still get the full benefits. Alternatively, the move Scald gets a 1.5x boost, so you could switch the weather to rain and go to town with a Swift Swim user to at least rival the speediness of Excadrill and threaten Claydol, Nidoqueen, Camerupt, and Gliscor, though it does get cancelled somewhat by the 1.5x special defense boost for ground types. Like with Souta's field, you also may get some success by simply copying what Ryland is doing: send in your own tanky Ground types with Telluric Seeds and see what havoc they can wreak. One way or another you can overcome Flora once and for all!

After the battle, heal up, because there's more...

Head back to the top, then go up when you hear a sound at the skyview. After a few cutscenes, you'll enter a battle! There is a catch with this one, see if you can spot it.

After a few more cutscenes, you'll be in control of Adam and Delpha for another battle!

??? ??? (Desert Field)
-   Beheeyem, Level 85. @ Beheeyem Crest.
    -   Psyshock
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Signal Beam
    -   Recover
-   Mismagius, Level 83. @ Telluric Seed.
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Mystical Fire
    -   Power Gem
    -   Nasty Plot
-   Porygon-Z, Level 84. @ Normalium-Z.
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Psychic
    -   Hidden Power (Fighting)
    -   Conversion
-   Stantler, Level 83. @ Stantler Crest.
    -   Return
    -   Zen Headbutt
    -   Sucker Punch
    -   Hypnosis
-   Klinklang, Level 84. @ Air Balloon.
    -   Shift Gear
    -   Gear Grind
    -   Return
    -   Secret Power
-   Orbeetle, Level 83. @ Orbeetlenite.
    -   Sticky Web
    -   Struggle Bug
    -   Reflect
    -   Psychic

This one can be tough, luckily nothing as bad as the previous fight with Ryland though. I recommend using Thunder Wave on Mismagius and then focusing on defeating the other side. Mega Aerodactyl and Gigalith are great clean up. Arenite Wall can be activated anytime if you need it. Be careful of Stantler's Crest which allows it to hit Hypnosis much more frequently and boosts its attack.

That's it for this bit, the spring will turn lush and green! If only this could've happened earlier to nullify desert field. Anyways, go ahead and approach the spring when you can. You'll get the Pyramid Point Badge and *TM105 Arenite Wall*! After a few more scenes, you'll be given a choice to teleport. Say yes if you want to continue the story, but otherwise we can fit in a few quests while we're on this island.

## Zone Zero Quests

There are a couple side quests that are now open in Zone Zero and elsewhere. Skip ahead to the hospital raid section if you want to finish the story.

Surf to the left side and the right side of the pyramid to get *Ground Memory* and *TM28 Dig*. Could've been useful 15 minutes ago!

Next, enter the Eclysia Skyview, then make your way down the lift. Once you use a teleporter, head left and surf up and across. Pick up the *Magic Wand* here! Exit the pyramid.

Head into the Apartment Depths where we were ambushed by Bladestar. Down here, you can grab:

ZCell 103: Apartment Depths

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image107.png"/>

Head up after grabbing this cell to get an *Ability Capsule*! Then, head left and follow the path all the way to the left to grab the shiny Lux Apartment keys.

Exit this building, get the right team ready and enter the one immediately to the right.

Challenger Venus (Big Top Arena)
-   Luxray, Level 83. @ Luxray Crest.
    -   Wild Charge
    -   Strength
    -   Superpower
    -   Iron Tail
-   Centiskorch, Level 85. @ Life Orb.
    -   Fire Lash
    -   Power Whip
    -   Leech Life
    -   Will-o-Wisp
-   Azumarill, Level 84. @ Iapapa Berry.
    -   Aqua Jet
    -   Waterfall
    -   Sing
    -   Play Rough
-   Rillaboom, level 84. @ Synthetic Seed.
    -   Swords Dance
    -   Acrobatics
    -   High Horsepower
    -   Drum Beating
-   Steelix, Level 85. @ Assault Vest.
    -   Iron Tail
    -   Earthquake
    -   Strength
    -   Smack Down
-   Ledian, Level 87. @ Ledian Crest.
    -   Mach Punch
    -   Ice Punch
    -   Thunderpunch
    -   Power-Up-Punch

These mad lads did it - made Ledian half decent! It's punching moves hit 4 times, so... it's gonna get up to max attack quick or perhaps wear you down with priority Mach Punch! Venus has a tough team, though almost entirely because of the team's synergy with the field. Many of Ledian, Luxray, and Steelix's moves can be boosted by the field, and since most of them have the affected abilities, which means they're going to hit real hard basically every time. Plus Azumarill's 100% accurate Sing, and you're in for a tricky fight.

Revelation/Petal/Fiery Dance are all boosted under this field, so a team using these that targets their low special defense might succeed. Dragon/Swords/Quiver Dance also boost stats even more, so a sweeper might see success here if they can get the opportunity to set up. Acrobatics also is boosted here and can help you get rid of Ledian, Rillaboom, and Centiskorch.

Succeed to nab the third *Star Shard*, as well as the *Ledian Crest*, and the fifth *Department Store Stamp*!

Exit the building and go straight to the right. Enter the tall apartment building with the key.

Once you enter, we're going to be doing a puzzle like RSE's Abandoned Ship backrooms. Feel free to solve this yourself, but the route is as follows:
-   Enter the bottom left room, 1A. Interact with the upper right
    sparkle in this room, the one that is in the second tile from the
    right in the upper right corner, to grab a key.
-   Exit, and enter the top right room, 1F. Interact with the upper left
    tile of the table to grab the next key.
-   Exit and enter the top middle room, 1E. Study these sparkles, then
    head left and enter 1D. In the rightmost tile of the bed in this
    room you'll find another key!
-   Exit, and go upstairs and enter the top right room, 2F. Study the
    sparkles, then go into 2E. In the bottom tile of the bed in the 2F
    side you'll find the next key.
-   Exit and loop around to the bottom right door, 2C. Go around and
    exit through the 2B door.
-   After falling, enter the bottom middle door, 1B. Grab the key two
    tiles above the rightmost rock.
-   Using the door to the left to get back to the main area, head out of
    1A and go upstairs to the upper left room, 2D. Grab the key in the
    single sparkle, as well as:

ZCell 104: Lux Apartments

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image108.png"/>
-   Reenter 2C, then go out the 2B door. Use the key on 1C in the bottom
    right door, then enter the ladder. Click the lever in this area and
    pick up *Rocky Helmet*.

Now if you head up in Zone Zero to the next map, you'll find that a gate has opened, leading you to be able to catch **Gible**! Keep it unevolved for now or catch two, there is a small quest we can do in a bit with it. Also:

ZCell 105: Zone Zero Gible Cage

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image109.png"/>

## Do the Dive (Floria)

Now that we have the Enigmatic Key, we can do some underwater exploring. All three of the next sections are optional content, but I recommend all of it!

Evergreen Trench

| Underwater        | %        | Rock Smash        | %        |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Clamperl          | 30       | Binacle           | 90       |
| Relicanth         | 30       | **Barbaracle**    | 10       |
| Sealeo            | 19       |                   |          |
| Lumineon          | 11       |                   |          |
| Clawitzer         | 5        |                   |          |
| Alomomola         | 4        |                   |          |
| **Walrein**       | 1        |                   |          |

Fly to the Evergreen Island first, and surf down onto Route 11. First thing we are going to do is go all the way up and right in the route, to the large mostly circular dive spot. Dive down in this area and interact with the submarine here. Hidden here is a *Blue Shard* and *Damp Rock*. Anyways, we're activating the underwater pillars on this route, tallest to shortest.

Surface, then go straight down and dive in the blob-shaped dive spot. Down here is a hidden *Dive Ball*. Resurface.

Fly back to Evergreen Island (to save a few seconds of surfing) and surf right, then down. You'll find a 2x2 square to go down, where you'll find the tallest pillar. Interact with it to activate it.

Surface, and dive down in the main area of Route 11. This gargantuan area has lots of hidden items, including 4 *Blue Shards, Revive, GourmetTreat, 3 Heart Scales, Pearl, Sea Incense, Ultra Potion, Water Stone, Max Repel, Nugget, Dive Ball*, and *Green Shard*. Anyways, in the southwest area of the map, you'll find a small 2x2 square to surface. Do so to grab *TM33 Reflect*! Dive back down, and at the bottom of this area you'll see a little tunnel you can go through. Do so and surface to nab *TM16 Light Screen*. Dive again and go left after exiting the tunnel to the north. Activate the taller pillar here.

Head straight to the right until you find another pillar. Activate it, then surface in the 2x2 square immediately to the right to get *Icicle Plate*. Go back down and go up above the third pillar. Surface at this 2x2 square to grab ZCrystal *Primarium-Z*.

Head back down, then approach the tunnel / 2nd pillar area. At the bottom left, sort of hard to spot, is the fourth pillar. Activate it, then return to the submarine. After a conversation, surface, fly back to Evergreen, then dive right here and enter the door.

Head up, beating 3 sets of defense mechanisms along the way. Once you reach the top, you'll be gifted the *Empoleon Crest*. Nice.

Next up, we're gonna fly to the Secret Shore. Make your way to the Wetlands Laboratory and use the teleporter to get to the backroom. Use the downward pads to go down, then dive in the water. Follow the path and surface.

Grab *TM112 Smart Strike* as well as Shadow Amaura! Use the teleporter to get out.

## Do the Dive (Terajuma)

Next, we're gonna explore some of Terajuma Island. First, fly to Teila Resort, and enter Aquamarine Cave. Make your way to the Aquamarine Chamber. Dive down in this area. We're going to need to activate a few panels in this area by floating over them, so follow this sequence:
-   Step on the 1st panel immediately above the dive spot.
-   Go straight down, then straight right. Activate the 2nd panel in
    this new area.
-   Go up as much as possible, then left. In this area, go left from the
    up-most position such that you go up to the northmost area. Activate
    the 3rd panel.
-   Go left, then down on the right tile of the two. In this small gap,
    head down and activate the fourth panel.

That's all we can do in this main area for the time being, so dive back out at the light spot where we activated the first panel.

Next, make your way to the floor which Amber once fell through. Surf down and to the left, then dive down on any of the tiles in the lowest row. Once back in the current maze, go directly to the right, then go left once you stop before the green rock. Go left then down, then head to the right. Make sure you use the bottom of the two current tiles to go to the right here. Follow this path to the left and out.

In this area, grab the *Water Memory*, then activate the pillar in this area. Head up and swim off the side once you've done this.

Terajuma Coral Reef

| Underwater        | %        |

| Chinchou          | 20       |
| Clamperl          | 20       |

| Clawitzer         | 5        |
| **Dragalge**      | 5        |

There is also various wild dive Pokemon swimming about you can interact with for a battle.

If you head up, you can talk to Challenger Neptune for a tough battle!

Challenger Neptune (Underwater Field)
-   Raichu, Level 85. @ Life Orb.
    -   Psychic
    -   Focus Blast
    -   Surf
    -   Discharge
-   Samurott, Level 84. @ Elemental Seed.
    -   Dive
    -   Megahorn
    -   Sacred Sword
    -   Swords Dance
-   Whiscash, Level 84. @ Whiscash Crest.
    -   Dive
    -   Dragon Dance
    -   Stone Edge
    -   Earthquake
-   Blastoise, Level 87. @ Blastoisinite.
    -   Water Pulse
    -   Whirlpool
    -   Ice Beam
    -   Aura Sphere
-   Dhelmise, Level 85. @ Assault Vest.
    -   Anchor Shot
    -   Power Whip
    -   Whirlpool
    -   Earthquake
-   Cradily, Level 85. @ Leftovers.
    -   Curse
    -   Earthquake
    -   Toxic
    -   Recover

This one is tough at first as she uses the Underwater Field well. In general, your non-water types not named Armaldo, Beartic, or Dhelmise will all have their speed quartered on this field, which is obviously not good since so many of their Pokemon can hit hard with field boosted water moves. Whiscash is dangerous here, as it has no weaknesses (except Water itself, on the Underwater Field) and surely can set up on you if you can't take it out in time. Luckily, if either Samurott or Whiscash uses Dive, the field will be returned to water surface, at least allowing you to not suffer so much speed loss. Her Raichu is devastating, as Surf and Discharge are both boosted by the field here, and it's given double speed by Surge Surfer. Dhelmise is good on this field as well.

One idea is to use your own water types as soon as Raichu and Dhelmise go down, as they suffer no speed loss and can take advantage of the field to hit Whiscash super-effectively and fight back against Samurott and Blastoise. The water surface field also was a bit easier to deal with in my experience - if you use Dive/Fly/Bounce/Shore Up or can bait Whiscash/Samurott to use it, it can make the fight easier. Plus, you can use Blizzard to turn the surface into Icy or Sludge Wave to turn it into Murkwater as usual. A tough fight but lots of ways to turn the odds in your favor.

Win against Neptune to get the fourth *Star Shard*, **Popplio**, and the sixth Department Store Stamp!

Make your way to the right. Surface at the spot just before the dark zone. Once on Route 6, head to the right, and dive down in the dive spot here. Follow this path around and enter the now-opened tower.

Read the lore on the green-tinted bookshelves if you want, then grab the *Zangoose Crest* and the *Ariados Crest*. Exit and resurface.

Next, fly to Kakori Village and enter Valor Mountain. Use the blue crystal and make your way to the Valor Chamber at the bottom. Dive down when you can here, then follow the path to the left and grab ZCrystal *Waterium-Z*. Take JUST ONE set of currents to the left, then go up and to the right. Activate this fifth panel (along with the four we found earlier), prepare for battle, and head up through the now-opened door.

Temple Kingdra (Underwater Field)
-   Seaking, Level 84. @ Elemental Seed.
    -   Waterfall
    -   Megahorn
    -   Whirlpool
    -   Soak
-   Dragalge, Level 85. @ White Herb.
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Draco Meteor

    -   Submission
    -   Whirlpool
-   Corsola, Level 84. @ Choice Band.
    -   Head Smash
    -   Waterfall
    -   Earthquake
    -   Icicle Spear
-   Kingdra, Level 86. @ Scope Lens.
    -   Dive
    -   Iron Head
    -   Focus Energy
    -   Outrage

Another tough underwater field battle, but like the Neptune battle, utilizing field-change moves like Dive -\> Blizzard may be the key to victory here! Alternatively, again your own water type can be quite effective in this field. Just be careful of Kingdra's consistent critical hits!

Once you've won, head up to catch a Horsea****! A weird prize since we got Horsea a few badges ago, but ok...

Exit in the same spot of the maze as we entered the first time.

Last place to dive on this island is at the first place we entered - so fly to the shore. Surf to the northeast corner and dive. It's time to explore the S.S. Oceania once again...

There is some *Luminous Moss* at the top of the entry room, as well as Corsola. Heading to the right you'll be attacked by **Sharpedo**. There is a hidden *Rare Candy* to the right. In this first room, pick up 5 *Dive Balls* then follow the path. Pick up a *Water Stone* in the room next to you, then beat the next Sharpedo. More *Luminous Moss* is hidden here.

A room to the left will have MegaStone *Sharpedonite*. To the right, beat another shark then follow the path to pick up 5 more *Dive Balls*. Exit to the right for 5 *Luxury Balls*. A door at the top to the left leads you to a *Dawn Stone* and 3 hidden *Pearls*. Finally, head up the stairs here and you'll have a chance to battle and catch **Mareanie**! Exit the ship the same way we came in.

## Kingdom of Goomidra

There's another major side quest we can do! One more new dive spot to explore, and it's quite the big one! Enter Honec Woods and make your way to the upper right-hand corner. Dive down here.

Swamp Pit

| Underwater        | %        |
|-------------------|----------|
| Stunfisk          | 30       |
| Gastrodon         | 30       |
| Clamperl          | 20       |
| Octillery         | 10       |
| Dragalge          | 5        |
| Clawitzer         | 5        |

Emerge at the top into the Kingdom of Goomidra. Hidden around town is 2 *Red Shards*, and a *Tiny Mushroom*. Speaking of mushrooms: there are tutor Goomy that accept them in various houses:

Left-Middle Move Tutor

| Move          | Price         |
|---------------|---------------|
|Seed Bomb      |1 Tiny Mushroom|
|Dragon Pulse   |1 Big Mushroom |
|Pain Split     |1 Big Mushroom |

Rightmost-Middle Move Tutor

| Move              | Price         |
|-------------------|---------------|
|Liquidation        |2 Big Mushrooms|
|Drill Run          |3 Big Mushrooms|
|Stomping Tantrum   |3 Big Mushrooms|
|Zen Headbutt       |3 Big Mushrooms|
|Gastro Acid        |1 Tiny Mushroom|

In the top right area of the town, grab 3 *Pecha Berries*, 2 *Lum Berries*, 3 *Starf Berries*, 2 *Enigma Berries*, and 2 *Aspear Berries*.

Enter the castle at the top, then talk to Goomelda in her room. Exit the castle afterwards, then talk to Goomink in the upper left house of the village. At the top of the village, fight and beat Goomink, then fly over to East Gearen after he leaves.

Enter Venam's gym, and head to the back. Fight Aya with Goomink. Shock Wave tends to work.

After winning, head outside the gym, then fly to Kakori Village. Head down to Crawli's arena and talk to Goomink here. Beat Crawli here. Counter tends to work.

Fight Goomy once you're outside the gym again. Fly to Sashila, then the Zorrialyn Coast to the south. Heal Goomy, then after the conversation head to the water in the village. Talk to the guy to add a yacht stop to the village, then talk to Goomink to embark.

Kawopundunga (Underwater Field)
-   Kawopundunga Wailord, Level 90. @ Leftovers. Stats:
    800/100/80/90/100/80. Ability: Water Veil. 3 Shields.
    -   Frustration
    -   Dive
    -   Rest
    -   Darkest Lariat

This is also a very tough battle at first look. With 800 HP, as well as the ability Water Veil which will always be activated on this field, you're in for a hard time taking it out. As a boss battle, there is no way to change its ability, and it has infinite PP. And, it has field boosted Dives.

One strategy is of course to change up the field on it. Two uses of Sludge Wave will bring it to Murkwater Surface permanently, which prevents Water Veil from activating, and actively hurts Wailord each turn... so literally you can just wait it out. Alternatively, as usual using Blizzard would lead to Icy Field, from which you can go to Snowy Mountain and then Volcanic Top, Mountain, Dragon's Den, and so on, all of which would of course ruin Wailord's strategy. Another alternative is, as we've seen before, just lowering its stats crazy low. Good news is it only uses Physical moves, so you can deplete its attack with Intimidate, Feather Dance, etc. Then a couple Fake Tears / Acid Sprays will allow you and Goomink's Thunderbolt to knock its entire HP bar to zero, even if it Rests the turn before. Anyways, you can do it!

Back on land, you'll have to face a team AA grunt as the Hero Goomink. It's not too hard with two Sacred Swords, luckily. Afterwards, fly back to the Kingdom of Goomidra. Make your way to the castle and battle the grunts as you go up. After the events at the top of the tower, head back to the throne room, and talk to the king. You'll get MegaStone *Swampertite* and *Infernape Crest*!

Head down the hallway to the right, into the ruins room. The first fight you do you will likely lose against Big Betty, but the second you can win by using Swords Dance, King's Shield, Thousand Arrows, King's Shield, Thousand Arrows, King's Shield, Thousand Arrows, Thousand Arrows.

Concluding the quest grants Relationship Points (Ben +6, Goomink +6, Karma +5).

After these events, re-enter the ruins room. While here, grab *TM08 Bulk Up*.

Castle of Goomidra

| Grass        | %        |
|--------------|----------|
| **Pawniard** | 34       |
| Solosis      | 30       |
| Falinks      | 25       |
| Duosion      | 5        |
| **Bisharp**  | 5        |
| **Malamar**  | 1        |

You can also exit the castle out of the southwest entrance to find some grass, with a hidden *Dusk Ball* and *Big Mushroom* nearby.

Kingdom of Goomidra

| Grass        | %        |
|--------------|----------|
| **Goomy**    | 100      |

Enter the house furthest to the right with the green roof and with the tutor inside. The left Goomy has a little shop!

Goomidra Crest Shop

|Item             |Price  |

|*Bastiodon Crest*|$100000|
|*Dedenne Crest*  |$100000|
|*Rampardos Crest*|$100000|
|*Whiscash Crest* |$100000|

## Zorrialyn Labyrinth 2nd Visit

Next, fly to Alamissa Urben and go straight up. Take the unconscious Karen back to the village, then agree to go to the labyrinth again. Add any Water/Rock type to your party - by now we've seen Relicanth, Tirtouga line, Drednaw, Corsola, Kabuto line, Omanyte line, Binacle line that all should work.

With that out of the way, head to the Zorrialyn Labyrinth. Make your way to the third floor just as we did before. Follow the southmost path to the east, until you reach a sign. Talk to the sign and show your Water/Rock type to it. Then, head north and west to reach the dive spot.

Note that in this area we can catch Relicanth, Clamperl, Luvdisc. We're gonna do three more runs to explore this area of the ruins and snag all the items. Do so as follows:

Trip One: DLU, get *Relic Silver*. Go straight down and grab *Mind Plate*. ULU, pick up *Calcium*. Enter the door and get the *Skuntank Crest*. DRD, pick up a *Heart Scale*. L, D all the way, RD. In this big room, grab the *Heart Scale* and the *Relic Silver*. URUR to get *Blue Shard*. Then, I was booted.

Trip Two: DR, enter the door for *Relicanth Crest*. R, grab *Splash Plate*. DRDL, grab *Pixie Plate*. DR, grab the *Full Restore*. D into a big room, pick up the *PP Up, Dread Plate*, and *Water Stone*. This is all the items we can collect, so I was booted shortly after.

Trip Three: To progress, knock out 4 Luvdisc in the map. There's one in the southwest corner, one in the southeast corner, one in the big room on the east side, and one in the northeast room. After, head to the middle south part of the map, and go in. Get the *Zap Plate*. Then, use dive in the sandy spot here. Attempt to grab the item ball and win the fight against the team. Get the *Cofagrigus Crest*!

Afterwards, head to the top of this map and enter the door on top with the incantation. Head up and agree to help Karen.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yeah, sure why not? (Karen +1)
- Maybe tomorrow. (Karen -1)

Note that leaving before the quest is over grants (Karen -1)
relationship points.

Fight the AA grunt. Exit out the right door, then fight the AA grunt here. Press this switch and exit through the teleporter. Now, follow the stairs on the left up.

Interact with the purple bookshelf on the left. You'll get Relationship Points (Karen +2)! Follow the secret path. Grab the *Eviolite* in the library, then the *Claydol Crest* outside! Go back through and enter the door down in the area with the stairs.

Immediately go left and go down the stairs here. Follow this path to a door to grab the *Spiritomb Crest*. Then head back to the open area and head all the way to the right, to grab the *Darmanitan Crest* in the door here.

Cross the bridge near the AA grunt. Go straight up and follow this path all the way through until the top of the castle. After a scene, start heading down the castle. After two sets of stairs, you'll notice a cave has opened at the top, so head in to catch **Larvesta**!

Head back out, but when you reach a fork, head left and go up the stairs here to get onto the area where Karen and Karrina are fighting.

Gang Leader Karrina (Blessed Field)
-   Musharna, Level 84. @ Amplifield Rock.
    -   Gravity
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Psyshock
    -   Hypnosis
-   Granbull, Level 84. @ Babiri Berry.
    -   Play Rough
    -   Dynamic Punch
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Earthquake
-   Nidoking, Level 85. @ Life Orb.
    -   Blizzard
    -   Fire Blast
    -   Earth Power
    -   Superpower
-   Durant, Level 85. @ Rockium-Z.
    -   Iron Head
    -   Stone Edge
    -   X-Scissor
    -   Return
-   Alakazam, Level 85. @ Life Orb.
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Gravity
    -   Psyshock
    -   Zap Cannon
-   Fearow, Level 86. @ Fearow Crest.
    -   Facade
    -   Drill Peck
    -   Drill Run
    -   Return

A formidable team, but nothing you can't handle. If you let Alakazam or crest Fearow come out while the rest of your surviving team is too slow/weak to take them out, you're gonna be hurting a lot in this one. You also must watch out for Durant, who will surprise you with a speedy Continental Crush. That said, you can probably easily find a way through this one: Curse, Phantom Force, Spectral Scream, Shadow Force, Ominous Wind, Trick-or-Treat are moves which all switch the field to Haunted Field if you want to: Alakazam, Musharna, and Fearow would all go down quickly to field boosted Ghost moves. She doesn't benefit too much from the base Blessed Field either, so you can exploit that for your victory too.

Afterwards, you'll get a choice. If you choose the first, you will get Life Orb in a bit. If you choose the second, you'll get the second mega stone from the Hidden Library way back when, but get (-5 Karma).

If you chose the second option, at the top, make a second choice. If you choose No, you'll then get MegaStone *Banettite* or MegaStone *Heracronite*. If you choose Yes, then the stone will be shining on the ground as you make your way through the tower.

Either way, head back to where you fought Karrina, and head to the right. Go up to grab the *Torterra Crest*! Exit the castle now.

If you chose the first option, fly to Alamissa Urben and enter a door all the way on the left, accessed via the top left side of the area. Grab the *Life Orb*! You can also read the journal.

In either case, with all the crests that we found in the crypt, fly to Sashila and talk to the left merchant for some lore, and a *Dusknoir Crest*!

## Ana Quest Part 3

If you've completed all the steps to the Ana questline so far, make your way to GDC.

At Pokestar Studios, head up, then talk to Ana on the right. Follow her to the left again, let the scenes play out, then at Dylan's place again, exit and go down and right. In the north side, battle through a gauntlet of trainers to proceed. At the docks, talk to the pair to end up in Kristiline Town.

After a conversation in his house, follow Ana to the Sapphire Museum. Talk to her, then follow her to the Lava Cookie house above. After that conversation, go back to Dylan's and talk to her there. Talk to her once more in front of the Pokemon Center.

Use the boat to get to Teila Resort and go to the lighthouse area of the cave via the hole Amber fell through. You'll get 5 *Lava Cookies*!

Back in Kristiline, you'll get offered to go to Teila Resort. Head there and talk to Ana in the middle. Gather intel from the townspeople then talk to her again. We don't need to win the challenge, but if you'd like to, choose these options from her questions: first, fourth, second. Then talk to Gigiorno in the middle to get it started.

Back in Kristiline again, enter the house. That's all we can do in this quest for now!

...While we're on Terajuma, fly to Kakori Village. Enter the bottom-right house and present the *Magic Wand* to get **Fennekin**!

## Hospital of Ruin (2nd Visit)

Time to continue the story! Fly to Yui's Ranch, then enter GDC and make your way to the penthouse. After a quick scene, talk to Delpha and agree to go.

Enter Isha's backroom prepared for battle.

Doctor Isha (Factory Field)
-   Galarian Weezing, Level 85. @ Black Sludge.
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Toxic
    -   Strange Steam
    -   Flamethrower
-   Vanilluxe, Level 84. @ Icy Rock.
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Hidden Power Fire
    -   Blizzard
    -   Freeze Dry
-   Arctozolt, Level 84. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Blizzard
    -   Bolt Beak
    -   Surf
    -   Hail
-   Magnezone, Level 85. @ Synthetic Seed.
    -   Discharge
    -   Flash Cannon
    -   Hidden Power Ice
    -   Signal Beam
-   Dusknoir, Level 86. @ Dusknoir Crest.
    -   Shadow Punch
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Earthquake
    -   Thunderpunch
-   Dracovish, Level 84. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Fishious Rend
    -   Crunch
    -   Psychic Fangs
    -   Ice Fang
-   Giratina, Level 86. @ Griseous Orb. \[ONLY IF YOU DID NOT SAVE IT,
    REPLACES WEEZING\]
    -   Outrage
    -   Aura Sphere
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Earthquake

This fight can potentially be tough - it mixes a lot of strategies and works somewhat well with the factory and dark factory fields. Weezing is pretty tanky and can spread Toxic but isn't too crazy. Arctozolt and Dracovish both hit hard but are on the slower side, so hitting them hard with Ground / Fairy / Dragon moves respectively is the way to stop them. Crest Dusknoir hits hard with Shadow Sneak on the Dark Factory - make sure that whatever you are going to attack it with can live a Technician Shadow Sneak. And, if you could take Giratina back in your Level 30's, you can now.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I've been great! (Venam +3)
- It's been going. (Neutral)

After the rest of the cutscenes play out... we did it! There are a couple quests we can take care of right now before progressing the story further.

As a note, if we head over to the Pokemon Hospital south from here, we can spend $50000 at night to max out one EV, max out one IV, and give Pokerus to a single Pokemon. This is really only critical for the IV itself, but the price is high. Up to you if you have a particularly bad IV.

Head over to the Botanical Gardens if Florin is still alive.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- That's great, Florin! (Florin +2)
- You? Mayor? (Florin -2)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'd love to! (Florin +2)
- Sorry, I'm busy... (Florin -2)

## Narcissa's Quest (Final)

Head over to Goldenleaf Town. Talk to Narcy by her house. Follow her to her house and head upstairs. Read her journal, then head out.

You'll need something with Dark Pulse or Night Daze - the easiest is the Spiritomb we caught earlier which comes with Dark Pulse. Add it to your party and head down to Phasial Cave, using Rock Climb to descend to a lower level.

Phasial Cave Crystal Area

| Cave        | %        |
|-------------|----------|
| Meowth      | 40       |
| Chewtle     | 24       |
| Silicobra   | 20       |
| Bibarel     | 9        |
| Wooper      | 6        |
| Venipede    | 1        |

Talk to Narcissa once you cross the bridge, grab the *Ability Capsule*.

Next, fly to the Rose Theater, and enter Forlorned Cavern on Route 9. Enter the first room in the main area of the cave, with the time stone. After a scene with Narcissa, accept the fast travel to the Cliffside Grave if you've been already -- if not, follow the path earlier in the game to Rift Chandelure. Talk to her again, then head to Phasial Cave.

Head up and watch the scenes play out. Then, in Narcissa's house, talk to her upstairs. Head out and go to the Wispy Tower. Talk to young Narcy here and go in. Enter the lab, and head left. Talk to her again. Enter the western room, and surf up. Watch the CD Rom, then return to Narcissa's house and talk to them again. Accept fast travel.

Follow the Rotom into the cave, then take the time crystal to the past. Interact with the safe here. Then, pull the lever in the top left corner, hiding in boxes. Go down the ladder and out. Here you can find hidden *Revival Herb* and *Full Heal*, and a *Health Wing* in the first floor right room. Unlock the gate, and head in. Pick up a hidden *Blue Shard*, then talk to her at the top, then the box.

After a scene, talk to Narcissa and agree to go. Enter the manor and head upstairs. Go through the back, then go upstairs again. Make your way to the bottommost room, with the fireplace. After a scene, enter the fireplace, then talk to the safe after another scene for a *Fairy Memory*. Exit to the well in the backyard.

Grab the Rift Notes for Code: Rembrence...

Dimensional Rift Dufaux (Bewitched Field)
-   Froslass (Dufaux Form), Level 90. @ Metronome. Ability: Temporal
    Shift. 4 Shields.
    -   Poison Gas
    -   Discharge
    -   Ice Beam
    -   Moonblast

Form 1: Electric/Fairy, Stats: 500/60/250/130/250/60

Form 2: Electric/Ice, Stats: 500/60/130/300/130/180

This is another potentially tough fight, this time, difficult for opposite reasons than the Wailord. Its ability prevents stat loss, so our normal strategy doesn't work as well here. Luckily Narcissa's Gothitelle likes to use Light Screen on Turn 1, so take advantage of those turns to batter the shields! The second form isn't too defensive so you can wear it down if you can survive - Trick Room is an excellent choice.

After a scene in Goldenleaf which grants Relationship Points (Narcissa
+6), you'll be free to head to the Lost Castle. All the way at the top, you'll get a chance to battle **Rotom**!

Fly to West Gearen and go talk to Gabriel at the West Gearen power plant. Follow him left then up then up again to get access to a room where you can change Rotom's form! You'll also get the seventh *Department Store Stamp*!

## Department Store and Deino

Exit the department store and fly over to Kristiline Town. Head up to the Isle of Angels and place the Dark Core on the pillar on the island to encounter **Deino**. Sweet!

## Zygarde 10% Form

There's just one more thing we can do... If you've noticed, we've collected a lot of Zygarde Cells. Return to Gearen City to talk to Ayuda.

Fly to Sashila and make your way to the end of Sand Stream Cave the same way as we did earlier in the game. Once you have, in the back room, grab:

ZCore 1: Sand Stream Cave

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image110.png"/>

Fly back to Gearen and talk to Ayuda to get **Zygarde 10%**! It's not even particularly better than the Gible we got earlier, but hey another legendary!

Finally, to progress the story, return to the penthouse and talk to Melia.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Full-time? (Reina +1)
- Part-time? (Neutral)
