# Chapter 11: Through the Looking Mask

Grab the hidden *Hyper Potion* in the upstairs of the train station. Head outside to begin to explore the vast Grand Dream City!

## Dream District South

!enc(9, ["Grass"], nil, "Dream District (South)")

Grand Dream City has a ton of different NPCs and events depending on the time of day (ugh). So make sure to check areas during the morning, day, and night (UGH).

Enter the Dream Hotel to the left. This is actually a copy of the daycare in Sheridan, so you can breed Pokemon here.

**ZCell 104: Dream District**

!img("zcell104.png")

Head down from here.

!battle(["Gorigan",:COOLGUY,0], "City Field")

You'll notice a star above your head after the battle. Your reputation in GDC will go up as you do things like battle trainers. Anyways, a hidden *Poison Gem* is to the left. Nothing to do in the S.P.U. building, so head right. Grab the *Exp. Candy XL* at the bottom. We can't exit to Route 7 right now, so go right.

!battle(["Mandy",:FAIRYGIRL,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Len",:BUGCATCHER,0], "City Field")

Pick up the hidden *Dark Gem* and *Magical Seed*.

!battle(["Beat",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Kenneth",:POKEMONRANGER_M,0], "City Field")

Beat this guy (morning/day only) to get a *Leppa Berry*.

!shop("GDC Ice Cream", ["Vanilla Ice Cream", "Choc Ice Cream", "Berry Ice Cream"])

## Judicial District

We're next going to head to the west. Checkout Pokestar Studios if you like, then go west into the Judicial District.

!battle(["Herald",:WORKERM,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Jackson",:OFFICER,0], "City Field")

!enc(317, ["Grass"])

Enter the police department at the bottom. In the left room, a little bit late, you can find the *Code Sarpa Rift Notes* plus any other limited-time collectible items you missed out on.

Head outside and go down.

!battle(["Andy",:OFFICER,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Johnson",:OFFICER,0], "City Field")

**ZCell 105: Judicial District**

!img("zcell105.png")

Enter the house in the bottom left corner to begin the *Wall of Shame* quest. There isn't anything to do in most of the other buildings for now, so make your way to the top left of the area.

!battle(["Lassie",:LASS,0], "City Field")

There's a hidden *Link Heart* left of the Pokemon Center. We'll tackle the District of Hope a bit later, so head back to Dream District South for now.

## Night Market & Dream District North

Enter the Night Market at the top right of Dream District South.

!battle(["Andy",:YOUNGSTER,0], "City Field")

An alleyway on the right leads to *TM67 Roost*.

!battle(["Haydee",:LASS,0], "City Field")

You can get massages for $5000.

Continue north to the Dream District (North).

!battle(["Darel",:CAMPER,0], "City Field")

Enter the Somnium Mall to the right. You'll get a *Somnium Mall Stamp*.

!shop("Somnium Mall General Store (1 Stamp)", ["Heat Rock", "Icy Rock", "Smooth Rock", "Damp Rock", "Grip Claw", "Light Clay", "Everstone"])

!shop("Somnium Mall General Store (1 Stamp)", ["Max Repel", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Full Heal", "Hyper Potion", "Ultra Potion", "Revive", "Escape Rope"])

We previously got a stamp for doing the Virtual League quest, so we can access one more section of the mall.

!shop("Somnium Mall Battle Items + Evolutionary Stones (2 Stamps)", ["Fire Stone", "Water Stone", "Leaf Stone", "Thunderstone", "Sun Stone", "Moon Stone", "Power Lens", "Power Band"])

!shop("Somnium Mall Battle Items + Evolutionary Stones (2 Stamps)", ["Air Balloon", "White Herb", "Mental Herb", "Power Herb", "Absorb Bulb", "Snowball", "Smoke Ball", "Destiny Knot", "Cell Battery"])

Outside, head up the hill to the left.

!battle(["Kella",:OPT,0], "City Field")

In Mika's Cafe at night you can get a *Reverse Candy*. Outside, you can find *TM31 Brick Break* on a table. Talk to Mimi at night to begin the *Spiteful Ex* quest.

## Botanical Garden

Enter the Botanical Garden at the top.

!battle(["Sallie",:CHANELLER,0], "Flower Garden Field")

Hidden here is a *Lum Berry* and *2 Revives*. You can catch the **Petilil** in this area. Towards the top of the map:

**ZCell 106: Botanical Garden**

!img("zcell106.png")

On the left side of the map, there is a path that takes you up and left. Grab the hidden *Sitrus Berry*.

!battle(["Nana",:LASS,0], "Flower Garden Field")

**ZCell 107: Botanical Garden**

!img("zcell107.png")

There is a hidden *Pecha Berry* beyond. That's all we can do in the Botanical Garden.

## Central Square

Head west from Dream District North to enter Central Square.

!enc(194)

Pick up the hidden *Lemonade* and *Exp. Candy XL* on the east side. To the west, hidden are *2 Green Shards*. A man to the left of the tall central building will give you an *HP Up*. A bit down and left from here is a hidden *Max Repel* as well as *Exp. Candy L*. Pick up the *Revival Herb*, then continue east to get a hidden *Grass Gem*, *Muscle Wing*, *Red Shard*, and *Love Ball*. A *Synthetic Seed* is in the southeast corner.

!battle(["Drake and Sherry",:COOLCOUPLE1,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Kiela",:CRUSHGIRL,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Orion",:TECH,0], "City Field")

Enter a house just to the left of the center of the map. 

!battle(["Holly",:LASS,0])

Talk to a woman for *5 Persim Berries*. Pick up the *Hyper Potion*. To the right, enter a building to get a *Sun Stone*. Further to the right, enter the tall apartment building. Donate $850 to a woman inside a few times to get a *Rare Candy*. There is also a *Moon Ball* and hidden *Ether* and *Dusk Ball* here. There is a salon down from here that sells $3500 haircuts for friendship.

Outside during the day, talk to a woman in the southwest side of Central Square and attempt to help her cross the street. Talk to the driver to the left to get the first *SPU Parcel* for a delivery sidequest!

Enter the Central Building at the top of the map. The EV Center is here should you choose to use it (though the Power Items make it obsolete). Talk to Rhodea here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- What's the Central Building? (+1 Rhodea)
- Were you close with Rune? (Neutral)
- No questions. (Neutral)

Talk to the group outside, you'll eventually get to have a 2v2 against Risa Raider.

!battle(["Risa Raider",:POPSTAR,1], "City Field")

What in the world is that Jigglypuff... Anyways, you don't strictly need to win this one.

## District of Hope

You'll be taken outside the Dream Complex, but we can explore a few more parts of the city real quick. Head back to Central Square and go left to reach the District of Hope.

Hidden to the left is a *Green Shard*. Enter the left door of the hospital. You can pay $10000 for a consultation with Nurse Joy, where she can modify one stat for EVs and one stat for IVs, plus give it Pokerus. Outside, make your way down the path on the left side and go down to get a *Soda Pop* on the dock. To the right, enter the Carmicle Residence. A *Thunderstone* is downstairs. Outside, enter the graveyard above. You can find a hidden *Blue Shard*, *Berry Juice*, and *Persim Berry*. Stealing gifts for the dead, you monster.

On the left side of the district, head up to enter the Pokemon Pinnacle, then begin your ascent.

!enc(458)

!battle(["Billy",:TOURIST,0], "Haunted Field")

Pick up the *Spell Tag* on 2F and another on 3F. There's a *Lemonade* on 4F.

!battle(["Trent",:COOLGUY,0], "Haunted Field")

We can't get to the very top yet, so head back outside.

## Lost Souls 3


There's one more sidequest we can take care of. Talk to Mosely at night nearby the Hospital of Hope if you have fully progressed so far in the *Lost Souls* sidequest.

Go down two flights and talk to the cash register. Then, head back up, talk to Mosely, and enter the doors.

!battle(["Johnson",:OFFICER,0])

!battle(["Mitchell",:OFFICER,0])

!battle(["Pines",:OFFICER,0])

!battle(["Stanley",:OFFICER,0])

!dbattle(["Gumshoe",:OFFICER,0], ["Miles",:OFFICER,0])

Talk to Isha. This is all we can do for this quest right now.

## Back Alley & Festival Plaza

Head back to Central Square and go left and up to reach the Back Alley. In Rhodea's office to the left, you can get a *Carbos* from Igglybuff during the day.

At the top of this area, we'll find Guy from the *Spiteful Ex* quest.

!battle(["Guy",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "City Field")

Beating him lowers your reputation! >:( At least we can head back to Dream District North to complete the quest. Talk to Mimi... or, you? to get the *Train Pass*.

Continue north to the Festival Plaza.

!enc(28, ["Grass"])

!shop("Festival Plaza Balloons", ["Air Balloon"])

Talk to the guy on the left and give him a Blue Shard in exchange for a puzzle! [This link](https://www.rebornevo.com/forums/topic/29088-timburr-puzzle-strategy-guide-4x4-rotation/) may be helpful for solving this type of puzzle. Here is the solution:

!img("darumaka.png")

Once you win, you'll get **Darumaka**. An *Ether* is to the left.

!tutor("Festival Plaza Southwest Tutor", [["Earth Power", "6 Blue Shards"], ["Focus Punch", "5 Red Shards"], ["Drain Punch", "6 Yellow Shards"], ["Pain Split", "4 Blue Shards"], ["Misty Explosion", "7 Green Shards"]])

Talk to the high striker machine here. Pay the price, then it will randomly payoff as follows: 2% chance of *HM06 Dive*, 14% chance of a *Poke Doll*, and 22% chance of a refund. Note that the first time you get the Poke Doll prize, it will actually be a **Stufful!** Note also that you can actually "rig" the game to always get the HM by having a lead Pokemon with Huge Power, Guts, Pure Power, or Sheer Force.

!shop("Festival Plaza Candy", ["Reverse Candy", "Sachet", "Funnel Cake", "Whipped Dream", "Apophyll Pancakes", "Rare Candy"])

!shop("Festival Plaza Ice Cream", ["Vanilla Ice Cream", "Choc Ice Cream", "Berry Ice Cream"])

Talk to the guy on the left. He'll offer us a chance at a little game, depending on which bait we buy. Standard bait is $2000, Delicious bait is $7500, and Gourmet bait is $20000. Here's a breakdown of what you can get for each:

|**Standard Bait**  |Chance |
|-------------------|-------|
|**Wishiwashi**     |1%     |
| *Heart Scale*     |10%    |
| *Link Heart*      |10%    |
| *HP Up*           |10%    |
| *Lemonade*        |10%    |
| *Super Potion*    |10%    |
| *Honey*           |10%    |
| *Poke Ball*       |39%    |

|**Delicious Bait** |Chance |
|-------------------|-------|
| **Horsea**        |1%     |
| *Heart Scale*     |10%    |
| *Link Heart*      |10%    |
| *Moon Stone*      |10%    |
| *Max Revive*      |10%    |
| *Ultra Potion*    |10%    |
| *Fire Stone*      |10%    |
| *Dusk Ball*       |39%    |

|**Gourmet Bait**   |Chance |
|-------------------|-------|
| *Jaw Fossil*      |10%    |
| **Horsea**        |12%    |
| *Shiny Stone*     |18%    |
| *Sail Fossil*     |20%    |
| *Dawn Stone*      |20%    |
| *Dusk Stone*      |20%    |

We can catch Wishiwashi elsewhere, and we also can buy Sail and Jaw Fossils elsewhere, so this is primarily useful right now for the evolution items and Horsea.

To the right is a move tutor for the pledge moves... which we already have. Down from here is a *Move Relearner* and a *Name Rater*. At the bottom, you can buy a Chatot for $15000... but we can catch one in the nearby grass?

Anyways, grab the *Green Shard* on the table. In the grass at the top is a hidden *Synthetic Seed* and *Friend Ball*.

Return to the Dream District South and enter the Dream Complex. Before we head upstairs, we will finish the delivery sidequest. Talk to the attendant on the left to deliver the first package. Return to the Central Square to get the next destination: Mika's Cafe. Head over to Dream District North, enter the cafe, and give the package to Patty. You'll get a *Link Heart*! Return to the driver to get the next package, then give it to the first cop in the Judicial District Police Station. Return to the driver, who will use a spray that contains a new Pokemon in an area we'll visit later.

## Night 1 Dream

Return to the Dream Complex once more. Go up to the penthouse and sleep. You will wake up in "New Game", and you will be asked a man's name: if you know it, enter it here. Interact with the pieces of the board, then talk to the attendant to the left. 

!battle(["Valarie",:LEADER_VALARIE,1], "Chess Board")

Use a Ghost type if you're stuck.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Valarie in "New Game" (+1 Valarie)

!battle(["Saki",:LEADER_SAKI,1], "Chess Board")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Saki in "New Game" (+1 Saki)

Talk to Adam, then to... Risa?

!battle(["Risa Raider",:POPSTAR,0])

What on earth is going on with this thing??

Once you wake up, head outside the room. You'll get a choice on which path to take next: either searching Talon's house or investigating the Night Market. We have to do both, so I start with Talon's House.

## Searching Talon's House

Head over to the Botanical Garden and head up to the house at the top of the hill.

!battle(["Guy",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "Flower Garden Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's okay. (+1 Lavender, +2 Huey)
- You were being a tad rude. (-1 Lavender, -2 Huey)
- Was it about Talon? (Neutral)

Enter the Treasure Treehouse and head downstairs. Take *Flora's Puzzle Box* in Flora's room to begin a sidequest. Talk to Lavender to enter the other plane, then talk to the blobs in the kitchen and Flora and Florin's rooms. Talk to Lavender again.

!battle(["???",:MASKEDMAN,3])

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat the Masked Man (+1 Hazuki)
- Lose to the Masked Man (-1 Hazuki)

Talk to the final blob and head up the ladder. Our next destination will be Club NightLight. Accept the fast travel, then talk to the Alakazam blob once you are able to.

You'll need to defeat some trainers in the next room.

!battle(["Orion",:SCIENTIST,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Jensin",:ROCKER,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Karla",:BEAUTY,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Mordecai",:FISHERMAN,1], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Johnson",:OFFICER,1], "Concert Venue")

Hop over the counter at the bottom to crowd surf to the top.

!boss("LAVALAKAZAM", "Concert Venue")

Alakazam's first form will boost stats, set up screens, and use Night Shade, while its later forms will outspeed and demolish basically anything up against it. It even has Counter, meaning taking out its second health bar with a physical attack may be punished during the third. 

You can still get around these difficulties in a few simple ways: first is to use a Normal type that can set up against the first phase completely for free, as long as it has a contingency for Counter and taking one hit. The other, simpler solution is simply using Trick Room during the first phase and then whacking it really hard with some physical moves. 

## Investigating the Night Market

Head over to the Night Market and talk to Risa Raider. You'll get a letter to stuff in a mailbox. The mailbox in question is hidden around the left corner of the Dream Complex in Dream District South. Return to Risa.

Our next destination is a house in the southwest side of Central Square. Talk to the mailbox.

!battle(["Cindie",:GHOSTGIRL,0], "City Field")

Next, go to a mailbox at the northeastern corner of Vienna's Hill in Dream District North.

!battle(["Jeffy",:FISHERMAN,0], "City Field")

Make your way to the Night Market. On the right is a familiar face behind a jewelry stand.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Sure, what's up? (+2 Venam)
- Is this important? (+1 Venam)
- I'm busy. (-2 Venam)

Choose a ribbon for Venam, then fight her.

!battle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM2,0], "City Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Beat Venam after choosing a ribbon (+4 Venam)

Our next destination is slightly to the left of here: a biker guarding a door in the bottom left. Talk to him, then to Risa. Outside, talk to Rhodea above. The secret ritual won't make any sense... until you look right above you at the restaurant's symbols! Follow the steps... and you'll be attacked.

!battle(["Emere",:CUEBALL,0])

Cut down the poster and head in.

!battle(["Marquis",:CUEBALL,0], "Icy Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Risa has problems. (+2 Melia, +2 Venam)
- I think I get it. (Neutral)

Now we can explore Cold Storage. Grab the hidden *Yellow Shard* and *Blue Shard*. Follow the path left past Venam, pick up the hidden *Ice Heal*, then enter the door.

!battle(["Jimmy",:CUEBALL,0], "Icy Field")

The code we have is now __3. Backtrack to near the lift, and enter the container.

!battle(["Luis",:CUEBALL,0], "Icy Field")

The code we have is now 6_3. Take the new ladder to the right to go up. Grab *3 Exp. Candy XL* and enter the container. 

!battle(["Tarto",:CUEBALL,0], "Icy Field")

Head to the bottom left to input our code: 643. Once you're back in the Night Market, go right to talk to the group.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're right... (+1 Melia, +2 Venam)
- You're crazy. (-2 Melia, -3 Venam)

Return to the Dream Complex.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I like it here! (+1 Melia, +3 Venam)
- I miss Terajuma too. (+3 Melia, +1 Venam)
- I don't like it here either. (+2 Melia, -1 Venam)

While we're here, head outside to the balcony at the bottom.

**ZCell 108: Dream Complex**

!img("zcell108.png")

Sleep until the next day.

*Special Scene: Venam's Ruminations* requires 10+ Relationship Points with Venam at this point.

## Night 2 Dream

You will be asked more questions, but if this is your first playthrough of V13.5, you will not be able to give the answers.

You'll then be whisked away to the Somnium Mall.

!battle(["??? & ???",:MASKEDDUO,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Return to the penthouse. 

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- They're fine. (+2 Melia)
- Concerning... (+1 Melia)
- I am very tired. (-1 Melia)

When you wake up, talk to Melia on the couch.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Focus, Huey. (+1 Huey)
- Get it together! (-2 Huey)
- We can do this. (Neutral)

Enter the Grand Terminal Station and go to the left. In the Night Market, go right at the middle to reach Lavender.

Back in the Penthouse, talk to Aelita, then to Allen and Alice in the rightmost room. You'll get a *Nightmare Medallion*!

## Nightmare City

Talk to Aelita in the first area, then head up for another scene. In this central area, grab the *Apophyll Pancakes* in the upper right corner and *TM85 Dream Eater* in the upper left. Head up at the fountain for a fight, as Aelita.

-   Hawlucha, Level 70. @ Flying Gem.
    -   Acrobatics
    -   X-Scissor
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Protect

The catch with this one is that the team you must use is the same as this one! I managed to win by using my Speed Boost Blaziken with Brave Bird wisely. I'm sure you can outsmart the AI with the same advantages as you.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Of course not. (Aelita -1)
- Well... (Aelita -3)
- I'm not a judge, so... (Aelita +2)

Grab the *Vanilla Ice Cream* on the left. Talk to the kid here if you did the ice cream quest to get a *Rare Candy* if you got them new ice cream, and a *Reverse Candy* if you got them the one from the ground.

Head up and into the Nightmare Casino. Zetta will explain the rules and give us 10000 coins. At the top right, grab *Psychic Memory*. The left vendor will give us a *Coin Case* if we have neglected to get one yet.

Nightmare Casino Left Shop

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|50 Coins   |$1000      |
|500 Coins  |$10000     |

Nightmare Casino Right Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|500 Puppet Coins   |1000 Coins |
|3500 Puppet Coins  |5000 Coins |
|8500 Puppet Coins  |10000 Coins|

However, you need not deal with buying puppet coins or playing slots if you simply win battles. Talk to Don Carto in the bottom right: he will sponsor us with 10x the battle rate. So, by betting 10000 the first battle and 100000 the second battle we will win over 1000000.

That said, the battles are somewhat tough: each of the three randomly chosen trainers has an Ultra Beast and a Legendary Dog. Still, you should be able to set up against the starting Pokemon and overcome.

Talk to Zetta with at least 1000000 Puppet Coins, then head up. Grab the *Revive*.

There's an Audino level grinder here if you want to push your levels up to 70. Win to get 6 *Exp. Candy L* each time. Then, talk to Zetta in front of the box for a battle.

A somewhat tough singles battle. Again, a speedy rock type can deal massive damage to his team but watch out for Silvally in particular. If it gets off a SD, Return is gonna hit hard, so find a way to whittle it down without getting one-shotted. With a good team of 6 though his group of 5 will go down quickly.

## Trickery Badge

Head into the box and go into the upper room. Step on the bottom right and top left switch only to solve the puzzle, then talk to Aelita for a surprise gym battle!

Bunraku Beatdown: Psychic \| Special \| 75 power, but increases in power for each knocked out ally \| 100% accuracy \| On Psychic Terrain, power is boosted x1.5.

Time for a little lesson in Trickery. You ultimately are going to be fighting not just their team of 10 but also with the fact that Aelita's AI isn't always doing the best thing. Claydol's walls are going to be annoying - you must get Aelita to, or use brick break, else there's not a very easy way to OHKO even Magenta's sweeper team very easily. The strategy here I recommend is knocking out Claydol first then going exclusively for Neon, as if Xatu/Bronzong are out, they're tame to fight. If you can get to just Neon with Aelita having Hawlucha/Staraptor alive you're in good shape but watch out for how ridiculously bulky and strong the Musharna is.

Head into the room on the right to pick up *TM29 Psychic* behind the post! Oh yeah! Then, head into the box.

When you awaken, talk to the box at the table to get the *Trickery Badge*! Nice.

Head outside to talk to Aelita.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'll go with you. (Aelita +2)

Then head over to the Grand Dream Station. Talk to her here, and enter the train headed to Route 9.

Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard*, then head into the room at the top with the crystal and pick up a hidden *Pretty Wing* as well as:

ZCell 076: Forlorned Cavern

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image78.png"/>

That's all we can do in this section of the cave, so head back out and go to the left, where the hiker is, and enter this cavern. At the top, use rock climb to grab an *Ability Capsule*. There's also a *Dusk Stone* hidden behind the rock smash path at the bottom. Pick up the hidden *Mineral Ball* and *Ether* as you go to the right.

Exit at the top right, then pick up the hidden *Muscle Wing* and follow the path to the next cave entrance. There is a hidden *Clever Wing* and *Soda Pop* along this path: follow it to get *TM35 Flamethrower*! The tree here also has hidden *Honey* in it.

That's all the exploring we can do for now, so head towards the northwest portion of the route, then approach the Rose Theater. Use cut on the bamboo on the left side to encounter **Komala**! Surf across:

ZCell 077: Route 9

Enter the theater.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Don't be so harsh... (Aelita -2)
- Stop being ignorant! (Aelita -4)
- You did what you had to do. (Aelita -1)

Once you regain control, head through either of the two hallways and enter the stage. Talk to Ayuna and agree to help her find her Kimono Sisters. This starts a quest that we'll get to in just a bit.

While you're in this room, head to the southeast to grab:

ZCell 078: Rose Theater

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image80.png"/>

Exit the southwestern most door of the theater, and you'll grab *TM120 Solar Blade*. There is also a hidden *Fresh Water* nearby. Exit the southeasternmost door to grab a *Flying Memory*. If you exit one of the top doors of the theatre, you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball* and listen in on a conversation between Souta and Eldest.

Head upstairs, and into the left door.
