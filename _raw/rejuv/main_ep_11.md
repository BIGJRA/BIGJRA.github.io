# Chapter 11: Through the Looking Mask

Grab the hidden *Hyper Potion* in the upstairs of the train station. Head outside to begin to explore the vast Grand Dream City!

## Dream District East 1st Visit

Head out into the station. After a chat, reenter the train station to pick up a *Hyper Potion*. We finally made it to Grand Dream City, which is larger than both Gearen's combined.

ZCell 064: Dream District

Cross the bridge. You'll observe that you can take the train between areas for $1950. Since GDC is so large, I recommend at least exploring all the connections by foot (or bike) before you start fast hopping, at least to learn.

Enter the botanical garden to the north. Hidden throughout is a *Blue Shard, Reverse Candy, Ether, Max Repel, Red Shard*. In the southeast corner, you'll find a *Rare Candy*, a hidden *Wiki Berry, TM11 Sunny Day*, and:

ZCell 065: Botanical Garden

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image67.png"/>

Exit the garden and enter the day care. Give the girl in here $3400 and you'll get a *Rare Candy*. The day care here is a good choice for breeding: Main Street is a bit longer than any line in Sheridan Village. Head into the elevator here, and head to the 14th floor to get:

ZCell 066: Dream District

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image68.png"/>

Outside, a ranger gives a *Leppa Berry* when they lose.

## Main Street 1st Visit

Head west out of the eastern Dream District.

Pick up the *Sachet* and *Reverse Candy* to the south, as well as the items hidden all around this map: *Repel, Genius Wing, Muscle Wing, Resist Wing, Ether*, 2 *Max Repels, Reverse Candy, Blue Shard, Hyper Potion, Green Shard*.

In the first building from the east, on 75F, there is a hidden *Dusk Ball*. Enter the second house from the east and go up to the 24th floor to grab a *Moon Ball* and hidden *Ether*. Then, go up to the 45th floor for a quick scene that activates a quest. Exit, and enter the building to the left of the Pokemon Center. Head to the 8th floor to grab a *Hyper Potion*! Then, go to 16th to grab a *Sun Stone*. Talk to Igglybuff during the day for a *Carbos*.

Next, exit to the Grand Dream Gate area to the south. Enter the train track gap to the right and head up to get:

ZCell 067: Grand Dream Gate

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image69.png"/>

Also be sure to pick up *TM19 Secret Power* here. Someone fixed the bridge to the south if we need to return to Route 7.

Back on Main Street, there's one more event we can do. Talk to the big blue board on the right side of the area and change the weather to windy. This will allow us to catch Skiploom and Jumpluff here, but also, during the daytime, talk to the girl near the house with the T.M. on the roof. Then, head to the east Dream District and enter the park. Battle this guy to get *TM31 Brick Break*. Nice!

Head back to Main Street and head west.

## Dream District West 1st Visit

Immediately head up as you enter to grab:

ZCell 068: Dream District

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image70.png"/>

Head to the west and follow the tree line to nab a *Rare Candy*. Hidden on this map, you'll find *Green Shard*, 2 *Blue Shards, Health Wing, Iron, Max Repel, Ether, Red Shard*.

Enter the building in the southeast, where we can buy a few incenses and herbs.

Dream District West Spice Shop

|Item          |Price|
|--------------|-----|
|*Heal Powder* |$450 |
|*Energy Root* |$800 |
|*EnergyPowder*|$500 |
|*Pure Incense*|$9600|

|*Full Incense*|$9600|
|*Wave Incense*|$9600|
|*Odd Incense* |$9600|
|*Full Heal*   |$600 |

Enter the art gallery in the right side at night. Someone will give you a *Green Shard*. Talk to the guy on a couch, and he'll offer to trade a **Smeargle** for your Masquerain!

Head back outside. At night, head to the bottom right corner of the map to get *TM67 Roost*!

That's all there is in these districts for now, but we'll be back. Head back to Main Street, but this time, head north.

## Central Square 1st Visit

Head all the way to the top for a *Max Repel* and a *Green Shard*. A ranger will give you a *Sitrus Berry* upon losing. Also, at the top, you'll find:

ZCell 069: Central Square

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image71.png"/>

Hidden on the map is *Ether*, 3 *Health Wings, Resist Wing*, 2 *Muscle Wings*.

During the day, talk to the red head in the southeast of the pond for a *HP Up*.

To begin a sidequest, help the lady at the bottom cross the street. Afterwords, talk to the driver in the southwest, and he'll give you the first *SPU Parcel*.

Switch the weather to rain, then talk to the girl on the left side of the area. Talk to her again if you win for a trade: her **Slurpuff** for your **Roserade**. We already can access Slurpuff via a Whipped Dream, Link Heart and Swirlix, so take this if you'd like. You'll need a Shiny Stone for your Roselia.

Enter the central building and talk to Rhodea, then head out. Choose whether you want to participate in the tournament (it doesn't matter)
and watch the rest of this scene play out.

Head north to the Dream District North. There's not much to do there yet but attempt to cross the bridge for a conversation with Isha.

Head south, and through the northeast gate.

## Shopping District 1st Visit

Head all the way to the bottom right corner to find:

ZCell 070: Shopping District

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image72.png"/>

The bottom row here contains a Hidden Power checker as well as a move relearner! Talk to the little girl here who dropped her Casteliacone. If you want to be mean, pick it up: it's hidden right under her, and give it back. If you want to be nice, change the weather to Snow or Blizzard, then buy one from the vendor and give it to her.

Shopping District Ice Cream Shop (Snow / Blizzard Only)

|Item              |Price|
|------------------|-----|
|1x *Casteliacone* |$100 |
|12x *Casteliacone*|$1000|

Hidden around the shopping district is *Super Repel, Repel, Elixir, Yellow Shard, Super Potion*, and $1400 total.

Then, head into the department store here. Talk to the girl here to get a *Stamp Card* with the first department store stamp. Side quests give us access to more floors. For now, head upstairs.

Shopping District Mall 2F Shop 1

|Item         |Price|
|-------------|-----|
|*Heat Rock*  |$200 |
|*Icy Rock*   |$200 |
|*Smooth Rock*|$200 |
|*Damp Rock*  |$200 |
|*Grip Claw*  |$200 |
|*Light Clay* |$200 |
|*Everstone*  |$200 |

Shopping District Mall 2F Shop 2

|Item          |Price|

|*Full Heal*   |$600 |
|*Hyper Potion*|$1200|
|*Ultra Potion*|$2200|
|*Escape Rope* |$550 |

That's all for this area for now, so head back to the central square. Head straight west from here into the residential district.

## Residential District 1st Visit

If you turn the weather to Sunny, you can battle wild **Petilil**! Hidden on this map is *Green Shard, Super Repel, Yellow Shard, Ether, PP Up, Muscle Wing, Reverse Candy, Health Wing*.

Enter the Dream Complex and talk to the lobby host to give him the parcel. Return to the driver in the Central District for our next assignment.

We'll get to that in a second, but for now, re-enter the Dream Complex and talk to Rhodea. Head to the top floor and enter the bottom left room.

ZCell 071: Dream Complex

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image73.png"/>

Talk to Rhodea in the living room, then attempt to leave. When you're ready, head to the north into Dream District Northwest.

Hidden on this map is 2 *Mineral Balls, Max Repel*, 2 *Ethers, Green Shard, Reverse Candy, Genius Wing, Red Shard*.

Enter Mika's cafe during the daytime and talk to Patty twice. She'll give you a *Link Heart*! Talk to the girl next to her at night to get 10 *Dusk Balls* if you answer correctly: Kalos. Also at night, a guy in the upper corner will give you a *Reverse Candy*. Enter the building to the left and talk to the lobby worker for some *Leppa Berries*. Head up to 36th and talk to a guy at night for some *Quick Balls*. Grab the *Max Revive* on 13th.

Head back to the truck guy, and he'll give you the third *SPU Parcel*.

Head to the park in Dream District East and talk to Lavender in the park. Accept the fast travel if you want, but either way, make your way to the Dream Complex again. Head into Talon's Penthouse on the right. Grab the *Sharp Beak* in the left room, then read the stack of notes. Talk to Lavender in the living room. Talk to Huey in the middle room, then head out to fight Bladestar in the right room.

Exit, and head all the way to the Magnolia Theatre in the east side of the Shopping District.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's fine. (Lavender +1, Huey +1)
- You guys dating? (Lavender +2, Huey +2)

After a lot of bizarre scenes, head back to Mika's Cafe.

Head back to the Complex and go to bed.

## Story Split 1

Here we're going to have a split choice based on what we chose to do in the caves.

If you are in with Flora, your next destination is the botanical gardens. Head into the backroom and talk with her. Click the trees in the order Blue -\> Red -\> Magenta -\> Purple -\> Green, then head down to the lab. Head up and up again and watch the scene here.

If you are not in with Flora, you can enter the judicial district now, via the northeast corner of Dream District East. I will save exploring this area in full until after the next gym badge, since then players on all routes can explore it.

Enter Cassandra's office in the upper right. If you initially went with Erin or with Flora, you'll have a choice about whether to spill the beans to Cassandra or not about what you found. If you went with Flora and exposed her to Cassandra, you'll net (-2 Erin Relationship Points)
now, and this will push you towards the bad ending.

Head out with Venam when you have a chance.

## The Nightmare Medallion

Now, the story segments should converge from here for a while.

Head to the shopping district and talk to Venam and Madelis here. Choose a color, and Venam will challenge you to a battle!

Punk Girl Venam (No Field)
-   Toxtricity (Amped), Level 67. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Overdrive
    -   Boomburst
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Thunder Wave
-   Muk (Alolan), Level 67. @ Black Sludge.
    -   Gunk Shot
    -   Crunch
    -   Curse
    -   Fire Punch
-   Scolipede, Level 67. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Megahorn
    -   Aqua Tail
    -   Poison Jab
-   Venusaur, Level 68. @ Leftovers.
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Giga Drain
    -   Hidden Power Fire
    -   Earthquake
-   Seviper, Level 69. @ Life Orb.
    -   Sludge Wave
    -   Earthquake
    -   Giga Drain
    -   Sucker Punch
-   Charizard, Level 75. @ Charti Berry.
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Air Slash
    -   Focus Blast
    -   Roost

It's not required you win this one, but nonetheless it's an easy battle. Nothing she has can set up bar Muk so beat her with good type coverage and some speed and you'll be just fine. Charizard can be a bit tricky because it's stronger, but a couple super effective hits from fast mons will do the trick.

Soon as that's done, head into your villa in the Residential District. After seeing what's in the boxes, head into your room to go to sleep.

After a bunch of scenes play out, head north and west to the sewer area to talk to Huey. Then, return to the penthouse. After a strange conversation with Alice and Allen, and sleep.

Talk to Alice and Allen in the kitchen again, then to a guy outside the building.

Enter the medicine shop in Dream District West. Buy two *Nightmare Medallions* for $4800 each - one for a quest later.

## Darchlight Manor Second Visit

Now, we're gonna do a few things now that we have access to HM Strength. If you already bought the Golden Gauntlets, now they are finally useful! Skip one section ahead if you want to continue the story.

Head into Darchlight Manor in the woods. Complete the earlier Darchlight Manor section if you have not done so yet.

Use Strength on the rock immediately to the left, pick up the hidden *Ghost Gem*, then head in. Pick up a second hidden *Ghost Gem*, and read the Journal inside.

Enter the room up the stairs to the right. After an apparition, make your way to the right side of this room...

ZCell 072: Darchlight Manor

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image74.png"/>

Grab the *Old Gateau* and read the notebook. Exit the room.

Enter the room on the left side upstairs. Make your way through, grab the *Dread Plate* and hidden *Carbos*, then read the notebook.

Head back out, then into the top room. Use strength on the left and make your way left. There is a hidden *Spell Tag* in the bottom left corner. Upstairs, talk to the Clefairy doll, then push this rock into the hole.

Head back downstairs and enter the newly accessible door. Grab the *Chipped Pot*, and hidden *Old Gateau, Elixir*, and *Blue Shard*, then read the notebook and head up.

Darchlight Manor (Outside)

| Inside        | %        |
|---------------|----------|
| Duskull       | 30       |
| Shuppet       | 30       |
| Misdreavus    | 15       |
| Dusclops      | 10       |
| Hatenna       | 6        |
| Banette       | 5        |
| Mismagius     | 4        |

ZCell 073: Darchlight Manor

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image75.png"/>

Hidden out here are 3 *Tiny Mushrooms*.

Talk to the well and pull up the doll. Talk to it to get a *Light Ball*. Not the greatest reward in the world, but we'll be able to do more here later. With all that said and done, return to GDC.

With Nightmare Medallion in hand, enter the penthouse, and sleep in your bed.

## Nightmare City

Talk to Aelita in the first area, then head up for another scene. In this central area, grab the *Apophyll Pancakes* in the upper right corner and *TM85 Dream Eater* in the upper left. Head up at the fountain for a fight, as Aelita.

Xen Executive Zetta (No Field)
-   Gliscor, Level 68. @ Flying Gem.
    -   Tailwind
    -   X-Scissor
    -   Acrobatics
    -   Poison Jab
-   Lucario, Level 69. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Aura Sphere
    -   Toxic
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Calm Mind
-   Staraptor, Level 68. @ Assault Vest.
    -   Brave Bird
    -   U-Turn
    -   Return
    -   Endeavor
-   Blaziken, Level 69. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Shadow Claw
    -   Protect
    -   Brave Bird
    -   Blaze Kick
-   Mienshao, Level 68. @ Focus Sash.
    -   U-Turn
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Brick Break
    -   Protect
-   Hawlucha, Level 70. @ Flying Gem.
    -   Acrobatics
    -   X-Scissor
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Protect

The catch with this one is that the team you must use is the same as this one! I managed to win by using my Speed Boost Blaziken with Brave Bird wisely. I'm sure you can outsmart the AI with the same advantages as you.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Of course not. (Aelita -1)
- Well... (Aelita -3)
- I'm not a judge, so... (Aelita +2)

Grab the *Vanilla Ice Cream* on the left. Talk to the kid here if you did the ice cream quest to get a *Rare Candy* if you got them new ice cream, and a *Reverse Candy* if you got them the one from the ground.

Head up and into the Nightmare Casino. Zetta will explain the rules and give us 10000 coins. At the top right, grab *Psychic Memory*. The left vendor will give us a *Coin Case* if we have neglected to get one yet.

Nightmare Casino Left Shop

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|50 Coins   |$1000      |
|500 Coins  |$10000     |

Nightmare Casino Right Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|500 Puppet Coins   |1000 Coins |
|3500 Puppet Coins  |5000 Coins |
|8500 Puppet Coins  |10000 Coins|

However, you need not deal with buying puppet coins or playing slots if you simply win battles. Talk to Don Carto in the bottom right: he will sponsor us with 10x the battle rate. So, by betting 10000 the first battle and 100000 the second battle we will win over 1000000.

That said, the battles are somewhat tough: each of the three randomly chosen trainers has an Ultra Beast and a Legendary Dog. Still, you should be able to set up against the starting Pokemon and overcome.

Talk to Zetta with at least 1000000 Puppet Coins, then head up. Grab the *Revive*.

There's an Audino level grinder here if you want to push your levels up to 70. Win to get 6 *Exp. Candy L* each time. Then, talk to Zetta in front of the box for a battle.

Xen Executive Zetta (No Field)
-   Weavile, Level 68. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Icicle Crash
    -   Night Slash
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Ice Shard
-   Perrserker, Level 68. @ Protective Pads.
    -   Swords Dance
    -   Iron Head
    -   Close Combat
    -   Play Rough

    -   Dragon Dance
    -   Fly
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Dragon Claw
-   Typhlosion, Level 69. @ Power Herb.
    -   Eruption
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Focus Blast
    -   SolarBeam
-   Silvally, Level 69. @ Silk Scarf.
    -   Return
    -   Shadow Claw
    -   Swords Dance
    -   Zen Headbutt
-   Solosis, Level 1.
    -   Memento
    -   Memento
    -   Memento
    -   Memento

A somewhat tough singles battle. Again, a speedy rock type can deal massive damage to his team but watch out for Silvally in particular. If it gets off a SD, Return is gonna hit hard, so find a way to whittle it down without getting one-shotted. With a good team of 6 though his group of 5 will go down quickly.

## Trickery Badge

Head into the box and go into the upper room. Step on the bottom right and top left switch only to solve the puzzle, then talk to Aelita for a surprise gym battle!

Bunraku Beatdown: Psychic \| Special \| 75 power, but increases in power for each knocked out ally \| 100% accuracy \| On Psychic Terrain, power is boosted x1.5.

Time for a little lesson in Trickery. You ultimately are going to be fighting not just their team of 10 but also with the fact that Aelita's AI isn't always doing the best thing. Claydol's walls are going to be annoying - you must get Aelita to, or use brick break, else there's not a very easy way to OHKO even Magenta's sweeper team very easily. The strategy here I recommend is knocking out Claydol first then going exclusively for Neon, as if Xatu/Bronzong are out, they're tame to fight. If you can get to just Neon with Aelita having Hawlucha/Staraptor alive you're in good shape but watch out for how ridiculously bulky and strong the Musharna is.

Head into the room on the right to pick up *TM29 Psychic* behind the post! Oh yeah! Then, head into the box.

When you awaken, talk to the box at the table to get the *Trickery Badge*! Nice.

Head outside to talk to Aelita.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'll go with you. (Aelita +2)
- I know Erin. (Neutral)
- Maybe... (Aelita -2)

Then head over to the Grand Dream Station. Talk to her here, and enter the train headed to Route 9.

Explore the route a bit. There is also an Audino Breeder in the area, each time you win, you will get 7 *Exp. Candy L*.

At the top, you'll find:

ZCell 074: Route 9

Head down to the bottom part of the route. Here, you'll encounter wild Sandygast.

Hidden on Route 9, you'll find a *Calcium, Carbos, Big Mushroom, Resist Wing*, and *Swift Wing*.

Surf up and around to the right here. At the top, you'll find:

ZCell 075: Route 9

Back on the main part of the route, enter the first cave entrance on the right.

Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard*, then head into the room at the top with the crystal and pick up a hidden *Pretty Wing* as well as:

That's all we can do in this section of the cave, so head back out and go to the left, where the hiker is, and enter this cavern. At the top, use rock climb to grab an *Ability Capsule*. There's also a *Dusk Stone* hidden behind the rock smash path at the bottom. Pick up the hidden *Mineral Ball* and *Ether* as you go to the right.

Exit at the top right, then pick up the hidden *Muscle Wing* and follow the path to the next cave entrance. There is a hidden *Clever Wing* and *Soda Pop* along this path: follow it to get *TM35 Flamethrower*! The tree here also has hidden *Honey* in it.

That's all the exploring we can do for now, so head towards the northwest portion of the route, then approach the Rose Theater. Use cut on the bamboo on the left side to encounter **Komala**! Surf across:

ZCell 077: Route 9

Enter the theater.

## Rose Theater First Visit

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Don't be so harsh... (Aelita -2)
- Stop being ignorant! (Aelita -4)
- You did what you had to do. (Aelita -1)

Once you regain control, head through either of the two hallways and enter the stage. Talk to Ayuna and agree to help her find her Kimono Sisters. This starts a quest that we'll get to in just a bit.

While you're in this room, head to the southeast to grab:

ZCell 078: Rose Theater

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image80.png"/>

Exit the southwestern most door of the theater, and you'll grab *TM120 Solar Blade*. There is also a hidden *Fresh Water* nearby. Exit the southeasternmost door to grab a *Flying Memory*. If you exit one of the top doors of the theatre, you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball* and listen in on a conversation between Souta and Eldest.

Head upstairs, and into the left door.
