# Chapter 2: Redemption

## Junction Bridge

Head outside of the lab and talk to Karrina. She'll want us to go to the Junction Bridge on the left side of the city, so accept the fast travel to get there.

Head into the lab to battle Dr. Jenkel, with a choice of ally between Ren and Venam.

!partner(["Ren",:TRAINER_REN,7])

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,7])

!battle(["Dr. Jenkel",:MADSCIENTIST,0], "Factory Field")

Either partner will do well here, his Frogadier hits hard with Water Pulse and Misty Terrain boosted Icy Wind, while her Grimer can smack super effective STAB on each with Knock Off and Poison Fang. Low stats including abysmal speed prevents Musharna from doing much damage - stall out the screens from the Munna if you need to and hit Musharna hard with STAB moves and you'll be just fine.

After the battle, you'll be gifted *TM94 Rock Smash*! Now that we have this TM, we can use Rock Smash in the field. Use it to go down and right, and you'll see a **Blitzle**. Give it a GourmetTreat and it'll battle you! On the way out, head into Jenkel's lab one more time and pick up *6 Cell Batteries*! Make sure you save three of them for a quest in chapter 8.

## Team Xen Gearen Takeover

To the right of Junction Bridge, you'll notice the sewer stairs east of the Violet Building will now be open. Head down.

!battle(["Arnold",:TECH,0])

Here you'll find a **Rare Candy**. Also:

**ZCell 005: Abandoned Sewers**

!img("zcell005.png")

Exit through the top. Inside the wall of the building immediately to your right is a hidden *Reverse Candy*. Head up to watch the scene.

The third tile from the right on the top row of grass hides a *Green Shard*, while a hidden *Super Potion* is just to the left of the top dumpster. Two tiles left of the top-left grass is a hidden *Red Shard*,  while a hidden *Super Repel* is three tiles left of the bottom-left grass. Down the stairs and below the dumpsters is a hidden *Telluric Seed*.

**ZCell 006: Gearen Alleyway**

!img("zcell006.png")

Go up and give one of the **Munna** a GourmetTreat to catch it!

Return to the main part of the city, and enter the Help Center. Now that we've obtained 5+ Zygarde Cells, talk to Ayuda to get *TM49 Echoed Voice*. Our next checkpoint is getting 10.

You'll note that Team Xen Grunts are swarming East Gearen. In the northwest:

!battle(["Laurel",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "City Field")

Catch her **Shadow Vanillite**! To the east of the library:

!battle(["Orran",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "City Field")

Catch his **Shadow Wooper** and **Shadow Pidove**! Up from here:

!battle(["Yanny",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "City Field")

Catch her **Shadow Bonsly**! On the right side of East Gearen, east of the Poke Mart:

!battle(["Teepo",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

!battle(["Vera",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

One more quest we can do now takes place at the Chrisola Hotel.

Enter the room in the right hallway on the right, with Minccino in it. Talk to the old lady and agree to find Minccino.

Head out to the lobby and find it near the elevator. Then enter the left hallway and you'll see it right away on the bottom side. Follow it left and around, and you'll see Team Xen Grunts take it away!

Go to Gearen Park and fight the Grunts on the east side of the park.

!dbattle(["Wilbur",:XENGRUNT_M,0], ["Hayleigh",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Grassy Terrain")

Return to the old woman in the hotel, who'll let you battle to catch **Minccino**!

Especially if you've been catching all the Pokemon so far, you probably will have enough AP to get the Golden Hammer. This makes it so we don't need to teach Rock Smash to any Pokemon in order to smash rocks!

There are Pokemon in trees in the next area. If you want, bring a Pokemon with Headbutt to the next area, either Seel or Litleo work great.

This is all we can do in the city for now, so buy a $300 ticket to take the train east to Route 2!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You guys alright? (Venam -1)
- Cheer up, guys... (Ren +1)
- ... (Neutral)

## Route 2

There's a *Carbos* right and down from the purple flower on the left as you enter. 

!enc(199, ["Grass", "Headbutt"])

Remember to to get Dedenne to continue the *PictoZumi* quest. We'll also need to trade away one Aipom for a quest later. The next gym is fighting type, so most of these are going to be decent options for now.

!battle(["Ruddie",:AROMALADY,0])

The grassy spot in the middle of dirt right from Meganium hides a *Green Shard*. The end of a narrow path to the left of this trainer hides a *Repel*. The bush to the right hides a *Green Shard*. Up the stairs, a bush hides a *Red Shard*. To the left is an RV - one tile left and two down from the nearby cut tree is a hidden *Friend Ball*.

If you talk to the painter here, he'll wish to see Cherrim. At some point, level a Cherubi to Level 25 so that it evolves into **Cherrim**. Show it to this guy to get a *Miracle Seed*. He'll want to see Magcargo next, so we'll have to come back later.

Enter the cave here.

!enc(133)

**ZCell 007: Gemstream Cave**

!img("zcell007.png")

Exit the cave to the right. Go up at the fork in the bridge. On the first "tier" of grass and flowers, the rightmost tile hides a *Relaxed Mint*. The second tier's rightmost tile hides a *Rose Incense*.

**ZCell 008: Route 2**

!img("zcell008.png")

Continue crossing the bridge and enter the next cave, then go down the ladder. This room has three exits. The middle one will take you to water on Route 2.

!enc(199, ["Fishing"], ["Old"])

Take the bottom exit. You'll come upon a Mystery Egg at the end of the path. The contents of this egg are randomly decided upon creating your game file, so you can't reset for a different Pokemon. It will be one of **Skiddo**, **Mudbray**, or **Ponyta (Galarian)**, randomly determined. An *Ability Capsule* is hidden in a rock beyond.

Reenter the cave and exit at the top. Down and to the right are some stairs - up one tile and right two tiles is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Head down from here.

!battle(["Kaius",:YOUNGSTER,0])

Two tiles down and two tiles right from the next set of stairs is a hidden *Level Ball*.

!battle(["Connald",:FISHERMAN,0])

Five tiles down from the door is a hidden *Lemonade*.

**ZCell 009: Route 2**

!img("zcell009.png")

Go left. There is a blank tile with tall grass on four sides but on no diagonals that hides an *Exp. Candy S*. 

**ZCell 010: Route 2**

!img("zcell010.png")

Go up.

!battle(["Jiara",:BEAUTY,0])

A wall above her on the right contains a hidden *Ether*.

!battle(["Hinata",:TOURIST,0])

The path above is now clear, so you have a shorter path to traverse through Route 2. Return to the Kecleon Bazaar on the south side of the Route. On the right, you'll be able to purchase a *Magnetic Lure* for $2000. This item makes it so you will encounter Pokemon you haven't caught yet when held, which is fantastic for a 100% playthrough.

The four items of inventory on the left are determined randomly each day - a number is picked from 1-8. You'll get one set of the following:

1. *Super Potion* ($500), *Pomeg Berry* ($8,500), *Protein* ($6,800), *Black Prism* ($25,000),
2. *Max Revive* ($9,500), *Kelpsy Berry* ($8,500), *HP Up* ($6,800), *Ice Stone* ($25,000),
3. *Full Heal* ($200), *Qualot Berry* ($8,500), *Iron* ($6,800), *Link Heart* ($25,000),
4. *Max Potion* ($1,500), *Hondew Berry* ($8,500), *Calcium* ($6,800), *Galarica Cuff* ($25,000),
5. *Lava Cookie* ($50), *Tamato Berry* ($8,500), *Zinc* ($6,800), *Galarica Wreath* ($25,000),
6. *Ice Heal* ($50), *Grepa Berry* ($8,500), *Carbos* ($6,800), *Dusk Stone* ($25,000),
7. *Full Restore* ($1,600), *Sitrus Berry* ($500), *PP Up* ($12,800), *Dawn Stone* ($25,000),
8. *Revive* ($1,000), *Leppa Berry* ($1,500), *PP Max* ($20,800), *Shiny Stone* ($25,000).

Head to the top right side of the route.

!enc(199, ["Rock Smash"])

Behind the healing machine and a rock is a hidden *GourmetTreat*. Enter the cave here.

## Amethyst Cave

After a conversation with a shady figure, you'll have control in the cave.

!enc(4, ["Cave", "Fishing", "Rock Smash"], ["Old"])

Go left. Two tiles down and one left from the lady hides a *Nugget*. To the left and pick up the *Quiet Mint*, and the *Mineral Ball* hidden in the bottom right part of the nearby cart. Down from here, the divot in the wall contains a hidden *Green Shard*.

Head to the right, and downstairs. This is a new area technically with different encounters.

!enc(77, ["Cave"])

Again, Xatu is another good choice for the upcoming gym.

The wall below the second Joltik contains a hidden *HP Up*. Talk to Ren.

**Relationship Point Choices**:

- Is that strange? (Ren +1)
- What about them? (Neutral)

The rock below him contains a *Potion*, and one tile down from the box to the left is a hidden *Antidote*. Crossing the bridge, the bottom left box of the set on the right contains a *Green Shard*. A rock below here contains a *Resist Wing*, and there is a *Blue Shard* three tiles down and one tile left.

Head downstairs. The boxes directly left of the healing star contain a *Revive*. Grab the *Blue Shard*. Then cross the bridge to get a *Modest Mint*. The tile at the top above the metal tracks contains a *Fire Gem*. You can give a GourmetTreat to catch **Lunatone**. Activate Panel 1 while you are here. We will activate 5 more for a quest later.

Heal and save, then head up. Pick up the *Code Materna Rift Notes* to learn about Rift Galvantula. Partner up with Ren or Venam and take on Rift Galvantula!

!boss("RIFTGALVANTULA", "Corrupted Field")

This one isn't too bad, though the Joltik are annoying with their Electroweb attack. Unless you have priority, you're going to end up going last, so have something with enough special defense to take their Electric/Bug/Poison attacks and hit back hard. Venam and Ren are both worthy partners here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You think I can do it? (Neutral)
- Where do I go next? (Ren +2)

Back in the city, two optional things we can do now: first, talk to Zumi in the library, who'll give you the *Advanced Pokedex* if you caught Dedenne. She'll also send you on the next mission to get Drifloon.

Second, if you go to the Chrisola Hotel, our travels to Route 2 will prompt the girl in the first room in the right hallway to give you **Shinx**!

Anyways, back in Amethyst Cave, we can head north. Smash the rock and pick up the hidden *Red Shard* in the rail below. The wall behind a rock to the right has a *Super Potion*, and the second minecart above contains a *Mineral Ball*. The rail to the left of this minecart and one tile up contains a *Green Shard*. To the left, the wall down from the rock to smash is a *Zinc*, and the machine above here has a *Mineral Ball*. The wall to the left of the leftmost machine contains a *Reverse Candy*.

We can't really access the meadow yet, so head right and up. Talk to the hooded guy then get a hidden *Electric Gem* in the right rock. In the next room, the wall immediately on the right contains a *Genius Wing*. Two tiles down and three left from the first rock smash is a hidden *Reverse Candy*. On the right side of the room, the top box contains an *X Attack*. Head through the southeast exit.

A box to the right contains a *Repel*. Down and to the right, the right side of a drill machine contains an *X Defend* and the last rock contains a *Rock Gem*. Go immediately to the left in the next room to get a *Mineral Ball* in the wall. Follow the path until you meet Nim!

In the altered dimension, solve her difficult puzzles and prepare for a battle.

Apprentice Nim (Psychic Terrain)
-   Inkay, Level 20.
    -   Psywave
    -   Feint Attack
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Swagger
-   Darumaka, Level 20.
    -   Fire Fang
    -   Bite
    -   Headbutt
    -   Taunt
-   Lunatone, Level 21. @ Passho Berry.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Ancientpower
    -   Cosmic Power
    -   Confusion
-   Solrock, Level 21. @ Rindo Berry.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Fire Spin
    -   Psywave
    -   Cosmic Power

The Solrock and Lunatone can be frustrating with Rock Slide, but anything speedier can knock them out without much difficulty. Inkay won't be that much of a threat, so you can probably do well by letting it sit there while you beat up on the other side. Hidden Power is boosted in this field, so if you have it on your special attackers, especially those with type advantages, you'll be fine.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes (Nim +2)
- No. (Nim -2)

She'll give you the *Room ID Card*! When you are back in the cave, the wall to the left of the bottom stairs contains a *Super Potion*, and the one above and right of the top stairs contains a *Reverse Candy*. Head into Sheridan Village to the north.

## Sheridan Village

Listen to a cutscene with Aelita and the Elder. At the moment it costs money to heal here, so we're gonna start by heading all the way north into Sheridan Arena. Then knock on Keta's door at the very top, then enter the inn back in the village. Head upstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I will. (Aelita +3)
- Why me?? (Aelita -1)

Now healing is free, so we can explore Sheridan Village now.

Enter the first house and talk to a girl. This opens a quest for way later.

Go left to enter the shop.

Sheridan Village Shop

|Item           | Price     |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Poke Ball*    | $200      |

Enter the shop on a weekday morning and you'll see Beth and her Miltank. Talk to her to get a free *Moomoo Milk* sample, then her shop will open. Note that Berry Juice can be a pretty good hold item at this stage of the game. It is only open on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday Mornings.

Sheridan Village Drinks Shop (1 Badge)

|Item           | Price     |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Berry Juice*  |$100       |

You can sneak around the back of the shop, if you do, talk to the shop owner from behind to get a *Super Potion*! A tile left and up from the backdoor on the outside is a hidden *Tiny Mushroom*.

You'll notice a trucker up from here: this is Truck Guy. He will take us for free between Sheridan and Gearen, so take advantage of this instead of paying the train fee whenever possible.

Head east. Above the boxes is a hidden *Ability Capsule*. Enter the inn. Talk to a girl in the lobby to get a *Sweet Heart*. Talk to a girl in the first room on the left in the vertical hallway and take on her quest. The woman on the right in the hall will offer to teach you a few more moves for shards:

Sheridan Village Move Tutor

|Move       | Price         |
|-----------|---------------|
|Worry Seed |2 Red Shards   |
|Uproar     |2 Green Shards |

There is an Audino breeder towards the top: every time you beat them, you will get 3 *Exp. Candy S*. Once you're ready, we can take care of some side quests.



There is a day care in town. Take your Jigglypuff and any other Pokemon in the Fairy egg group there and breed to get **Igglybuff**. Then, trade it with a girl in the inn to get a **Smoochum** holding a *Twisted Spoon*!

Talk to the truck guy and have him take you back to Gearen City. In Jenner's lab, use the Room ID Card to get the *Exp. Share*! Read the note, then talk to Melia's wardrobe to get the *Audition Tape*. Plug it in to the computer to watch a lore cutscene if you want.

Head into the Gearen Lab and go to Jenner's lab. Head to the left and talk to Professor Hawthorne. He wants a Dex that has seen 100 Pokemon. This is an easy goal if you haven't been avoiding all the trainers and optional battles. Grab either the **Elekid** egg or the **Magby** egg and read Jenner's journal if you want.

Talk to him again, and he'll request a dex with 350 seen. You might not have this yet but once you do, he'll offer you the other of the Johto baby eggs.

Return to Sheridan Arena at the top.

Head up and talk to the **Swablu** flying overhead for a battle. Return to Keta's house and talk to him in his garden.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I am. (Keta +2)
- But i just got here... (Keta -2)

## Amethyst Grotto and Sheridan Help Quests

After accepting Keta's quest, head all the way out of the village and go back all the way through Amethyst Cave. In the second room, interact with this box of plants, then head north. Go to the west side of the room, where you'll see a man getting assaulted by **Solrock**. Challenge it to a battle and catch it to proceed.

Continue through the cave. Once at the entrance, head west until you see a red rock. Touch the stone, and a door will open. Enter and go downstairs. On the left above a tree is a hidden *Moon Ball*.

Amethyst Grotto

| Grass         | %        |
|---------------|----------|
| **Dunsparce** | 36       |
| Meowth        | 31       |
| Jigglypuff    | 25       |
| **Girafarig** | 8        |

On the right side, two tiles right and three tiles above the rock smash is a hidden *Red Shard*. A rock smash above hides a *Heart Scale* in the left side of a red tree. On the left, above the stage thing, in the middle of a red tree is another *Red Shard*.

Once you're ready, talk to the spirit of Keta. He will give you the *Soul Stone*. Then exit and watch the scene and fast travel back to Sheridan.

Returning to the inn in Sheridan you'll be given $8000 for saving the guy.

Now is a good time to do the Sheridan Village Help Quests. The help center is in the upper right part of the village.

### HQuest 8: Hidden Library 2

Start outside the help center and talk to the backpacker. Truck to Gearen, then go to the Chrisola Hotel and talk to Karen in front.

Head to Dr. Jenkel's lab and watch the scene. Go to Gearen Park and talk to Karen. Enter the library.

Pick up the green book behind the pillar at the entrance. Enter the main chamber and pick up the blue book. We can encounter Pokemon here, but there's only 1 type: **Unown**!

Pick up the purple book nearby. To the right there is a 2-tile space without a bookshelf on the bottom, one tile up from the right one contains an *Ether*.

Go right for the orange book and up for the red book. Also:

ZCell 009: Hidden Library

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image9.png"/>

Go down. Pick up the lime book, and *TM63 Embargo*.

Head back up and go all the way up, picking up the sky-blue book.

Head up. Next to the door, there are candle things. The second from the top on the right contains a hidden *Charcoal*!

Follow Karen into the north room. On the left, pick up the golden book. On the right, pick up the lemon book.

Now that we have found nine books, head back to where we saw Elgyem flying by earlier. Interact with the bookshelf it's on and place the books inside. A level 1 **Elgyem** will then battle you!

Head back into the upper room and talk to Karen. While she'll get the Mega Ring, you'll get the *Ancient Book*. This will allow you to read Garufan prophecies. Check out the ones on the wall, if you're interested.

Head back to Sheridan Village when you're done and talk to the backpacker.

You can choose to give him the book or not. I recommend giving him the book since we can get another later, and if you choose to, you'll get *Blue Moon Ice Cream*!

Claim your reward: $950 and *Water Stone*! (+1 Karma, +1 Karen Relationship Point)

### HQuest 9: Stolen Cargo!

Use the trucker to get to Gearen City, then go to Oceana Pier. Head to the southeast, then follow the guy into the warehouse.

If you try to go north, you'll get shocked, and your Pokemon will faint. The key here is to transform the Factory field into Short-Circuit via battling the Electrike trainer in the southwest and getting it to use Discharge. Once you've done this, head through the middle arrows.

Venam will join you for a battle. Once you've won, she'll leave.

Before we leave the warehouse, interact with the panel to switch the direction of the middle tile, then head right. Grab *TM09 Venoshock* then head back to Sheridan.

Claim your reward: $950 and five *GourmetTreats*. (+1 Karma, +1 Venam Relationship Point)

### HQuest 10: Trade Me!

First, grab one Aipom from your PC. If you didn't get one yet, go to Route 2 and interact with them. Then go to Sheridan Arena.

Talk to the girl with blue hair, then trade for **Pancham**.

Claim your reward: $1920 and *Rare Candy*! (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 11: Fetch an Item!

Start by heading through Amethyst Cave to Route 2.

Pick up one of the blue item balls. If you have 50000, you're welcome to pay for the item, but if not, you'll get teleported to the THIEF'S DUNGEON!

After talking to the grunt and getting out, memorize the map on the wall. If you don't take the path outlined, you will get destroyed... Enter the door that corresponds to yellow to get an *Ice Stone* or *Dusk Stone* depending on random chance.

Escape, and return to the help center. Talk to the guy to get *Blue Moon Ice Cream*.

Claim your reward: $1890, Casteliacone! (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 12: Battle Request 2

After the battle, return to the help center. Your rewards: $1600, and **Clobbopus**. (+1 Karma).

Real quick there's another quest we can do. Take the truck back to Gearen and enter Karrina's hideout near the sewers. Talk to her, and she'll send us on the gang fight quest. Head to Route 2 and enter Amethyst Cave.

Head up, and beat the guy at the end to get **Houndour**!

That's all we can take care of for now, so head back to Sheridan to see Keta.

Gale Strike: Fighting \| Physical \| 60 power \| 100% accuracy \| Guaranteed critical hit if user is under 50% HP \| On Forest Field, power is boosted x1.5 and deals additional Grass-type damage.

This battle is the first to really show you how well the trainers compensate for their type disadvantages here -- almost everything has a Dark or Rock type move. Scraggy is a good dud to leave out, especially if you can paralyze it -- it doesn't do enough damage to really be threatening at least compared to his other Pokemon. Combusken can be tough once it outspeeds you, but also has Protect so it might be smart to focus your attacks on the other Pokemon. A very tough fight but you have lots of team options to make it more possible.

Sensei runs off instead of paying up a badge. Follow Aelita into the waterfall cave.

## Carotos Mountain

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes. (Aelita +1)
- No. (Aelita -1)

You'll team up with Aelita here, so she'll heal you but catching wild Pokemon is a bit tougher.

Carotos Mountain

| Cave         | %    | Old Rod    | %    |
|--------------|------|------------|------|
| **Numel**    | 40   | **Numel**  | 70   |
| **Slugma**   | 30   | **Slugma** | 30   |
| **Onix**     | 19   |            |      |
| **Rolycoly** | 9    |            |      |
| **Nosepass** | 2    |            |      |

On the left, past a rock smash, is *TM121 Fire Spin*.

Once you cross the bridge to the right, prepare for battle and talk to the robotic looking thing. It will challenge you and has a Shadow **Ponyta**!

Head through the door, pick up a hidden *Full Heal* in the barrel to the right, and battle the Xen Grunts. The second grunt will have a Shadow **Vanillite**. The third has a Shadow **Bonsly**. Defeat SEC and his Flareon, then pick up the *Red Shard* hidden in the barrel to the right.

If you head to the right, grab the *Ultra Ball* in the left side of the machine as you go. The bottom left of the four barrels contains a *Reverse Candy*. Down from here, you can grab *TM43 Flame Charge*. Observe the passwords written all over the walls in this floor. There is a *Synthetic Seed* as well as a *Fire Stone* if you follow the path to the right. Right now, this will evolve Pansear.

SEC will require you to input a password to move on. The passwords are, in order, BEAUTY, IDOL, SHADOW. Talk to it a few more times and it will challenge you with a Shadow **Quagsire**.

Once you're ready, go up the elevator and head towards Madelis' Palace. Go inside when you get the chance to, and you'll team up with Keta.

Head into the left room. Grab the *Hyper Potion* on the left and *Revive* up above. At the top of the room, grab the *Yellow Key*.

Head back out and go into the right room. Talk to Sharon to get the *Green Key* and grab the *Fresh Water* in the top right. Talk to **Mime Jr**. in the top right to take it with you.

Go back and enter the top left room. Grab the *Red Key*.

Finally, enter the top right room. Make sure you grab the *Up-Grade, Dusk Ball* and the *Blue Key*.

Head back out into the foyer and insert each key into the keyholes on the walls.

Head up, then up again. You'll now have to fight Madelis.

Xen Executive Madelis (No Field)
-   Floette, Level 22.
    -   Magical Leaf
    -   Draining Kiss
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Protect
-   Salandit, Level 22.
    -   Poison Gas
    -   Flame Burst
    -   Venoshock
    -   Fake Out
-   Golbat, Level 24.
    -   Wing Attack
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Double Team
    -   Venoshock
-   Cufant, Level 24.
    -   Iron Head
    -   Stomp
    -   Growl
    -   Rollout
-   Houndoom, Level 25. @ Chople Berry.
    -   Snarl
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Thunder Fang
    -   Crunch
-   Shadow Mewtwo, Level 27.
    -   Energy Ball
    -   Psychic
    -   Miracle Eye
    -   Aura Sphere
    -   Shadow Chill

This one doesn't have to be won, though it is very doable. Winning grants +1 Karma and +1 Relationship Point with Madelis. This battle looks rough, but you'll have Keta on your side, so it's functionally a 12 on 6. A rock type can demolish half of her team, and Keta's fast fighting Pokemon will help you out. Two of them have fake out, so when you get to Mewtwo, try to take advantage of those turns to deal heavy damage to Mewtwo. Mewtwo also takes damage every time it attacks thanks to Fever Pitch, so take advantage of that and dish out as much damage as you can as soon as her other Pokemon are all wiped out.

Afterwards, head into the door behind Madelis' chair, and go down the lift.

We haven't had enough legendary battles with only one gym badge quite yet, so follow Aelita up and grab the *Rift Dex Info*.

After a brief scene, you'll be taken into a rift space. Talk to Volcanion and answer its question and the battle will begin!

Dimensional Rift Volcanion
-   Volcanion, Level 23. @ Demon Stone. Ability: Water Absorb. Stat
    Spread: 110/60/80/90/200/20. 2 Shields.
    -   Water Pulse
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Bulldoze
    -   Rock Slide

So, you'll probably be faster than this guy. With only 110/80 on the physical side, it's not too hard to whittle its shields, then its entire health bar down with some decent STAB moves.

Once you're free, head to the gate in Sheridan, and enter the spring.

Spring of Purification

| Grass        | %    | Old Rod/Good Rod    | %    |
|--------------|------|---------------------|------|
| Bellsprout   | 46   | Goldeen             | 100  |
| Zigzagoon    | 20   |                     |      |
| Illumise     | 10   |                     |      |
| Volbeat      | 10   |                     |      |
| Paras        | 10   |                     |      |
| Oddish       | 4    |                     |      |

Pick up the *Magical Seed* up from the entrance. Head up and talk to the pair.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you ok? (+1 Karma)
- Who's Vivian? (Neutral)

Once you leave the shrine, Keta will ask you to fast travel to Amethyst Grotto. If you're ready, feel free. Otherwise, we now have up to 7 new Pokemon we can use by purifying them! Shadow Pokemon in Rejuvenation have moves they can't normally get, for example Ponyta has Fell Stinger and Bonsly has Shift Gear. To purify, keep the shadow Pokemon in your party and run around, or use the Purify Chamber in the PC.

One more thing we can do: head into the house in the bottom right of Sheridan. Gothitelle will battle us!

Crescent's Gothitelle (No Field)
-   Gothitelle, Level 32. @ Twisted Spoon.
    -   Psychic
    -   Shock Wave
    -   Calm Mind
    -   Signal Beam

If you win, you'll be able to pick up **Gothita** behind!

Head into Amethyst Grotto ready for the REAL gym fight.

## Diamond Punch Badge

Well, that's about all we can take care of at this point.

Head back to Amethyst Grotto with a fully healed team. The Spirit of Keta will be able to give us a badge, so let's challenge him.

Sensei Keta (No Field)
-   Larvesta, Level 22
    -   Flame Charge
    -   Take Down
    -   Bug Bite
    -   Magnet Rise
-   Roselia, Level 22. @ Occa Berry.
    -   Magical Leaf
    -   Hidden Power Water
    -   Venoshock
    -   Leech Seed
-   Ninetales, Level 23. @ Charcoal.
    -   Flame Burst
    -   Will-o-Wisp
    -   Hex
    -   Feint Attack
-   Krokorok, Level 23. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Bite
    -   Bulldoze
    -   Hone Claws
    -   Poison Sweep
-   Lapras, Level 24. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Body Slam
    -   Water Pulse
    -   Freeze Dry
    -   Ice Shard
-   Gallade, Level 25. @ Leftovers.
    -   Low Sweep
    -   Psycho Cut
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Poison Sweep

Compared to Novae, this battle won't be too hard but is still scary. Gallade hits hard and is fast. In general, you want to try to set up on one of the weaker Pokemon like Roselia or Larvesta, if you can, it won't be too awful.

After you win, you'll get the Diamond Fist Badge! This enables you to cut and puts our level cap at 30. He'll also leave behind *TM103 Stacking Shot*.

Talk to Aelita upstairs and agree to sleep.
