# .Karma Files

Head into the League Administration and talk to Erin in the middle room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Do what? (Neutral)
- Time to awaken Adrest. (Neutral)
- Your hair is nice today. (+1 Erin)

Accept the fast travel to the Field of Pillars and talk to the Obelisk to enter Zeight. Attempt to awaken Adrest above, then head up.

!battle(["Crescent",:INTERCEPTOR,0], "Deep Earth Field")

!move("CHTHONICMALADY")

The Deep Earth Field hasn't been explored much so far, so you'll likely be caught off guard by all of Crescent's tricks on it. In a nutshell this field makes all effects of weight and speed amplified in some way: Gyro Ball becomes max power (speedy Mega Metagross oneshots easily), Iron Ball modifies Speed directly (for Malamar, raises it), many moves like Dragon Rush and Icicle Crash, and Ground moves in general are boosted, and Gravity is always on. High priority moves like Sucker Punch and Vacuum Wave have their power lowered here, though lower priority moves like Vital Throw are boosted. You get to take advantage of all these things too, so get to reading those field notes if you are stuck. Be careful of Crescent's Gothitelle: it instantly uses its custom move when it is sent into battle, petrifying your Pokemon, lowering its stats, and Tormenting it. Plus, it has a Crest and two Shields.

After you win, wake up Adrest, then head up and around in this bizarre place.

You'll find yourself playing as the original Interceptor once more. Head right a few rooms and attempt to take the elevator. After a chat, try the elevator again. Read the journal entries.

Once you're back at the Obelisk, reenter. Grant Melia access.

You'll awaken in Zeight on the 8th. Talk to Erin in the second room from the right. Before we accept her request and continue .Karma Files... there are a bunch of sidequests that have opened up! Legendary ones!

While we're in Sashila Village, a new in-game trade has opened up. A girl is at the bottom of the village, just to the right of the bottom-rightmost house. She wants our Toxapex in exchange for a **Magikarp (Aevian)** named Hot Dog! How nice. Talk to the very same Toxapex afterward to give it a small loan of $100,000 to get *10 Pearls*, *3 Big Pearls*, a *Pearl String*, and the *Toxtricitite*!

## Legendary Wings

Talk to the scientist with the hood in the League Administration to get the *Legendary Wings* quest. 

First, fly over to Evergreen Island. All the way on the southeast side of Route 11 is the Seabound Cave East; climb the stairs outside on its island to catch **Articuno**!

Next, fly over to Goldenleaf Town and head west to Goldenwood Forest. Cross the easternmost land bridge to catch **Zapdos**!

Finally, fly over to Teila Resort and follow the path through the Magrodar Crater. Catch **Moltres**!

Return to the scientist to finish this quest.

## Vivian's Regret

Fly to Sheridan and enter Carotos Mountain. Make your way through the Corrupted Cave to the Garufa Sanctuary. 

Inside the sanctuary, you'll see various Darchlight Crystals scattered about. Talk to each one of them to view a scene - eventually a glowing door in the left wing of the area will be unlocked. Head in, read the book, and show a Water type to the statue in order to activate one more Darchlight Crystal at the entrance. View that one, then head towards where we fought Groudon. Smash this Darchlight Crystal and enter the teleporter.

Step on the seven tiles in the next room to catch **Regirock**!

Nymiera will unlock one more seal and warp you to the door, so go up.

!boss("ADMIN", "Deep Earth Field")

Here's the thing: the way the boss's shields work means you cannot defeat it. The game does not expect you to defeat it. If you manage to break its shield 100 times though, the game rewards you by telling you you're wasting your time and treating it as a loss anyways! How to accomplish this, I leave as an exercise to the reader.

Destroy the terminal, or don't, then head out of this room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- After destroying the terminal: "Envoys were mistreated" (Neutral)
- After destroying the terminal: "Save Aelita from her fate" (Neutral)
- After destroying the terminal: "To Destroy Earth" (-999 Nymiera)
- After destroying the terminal: "To spite Admin" (-999 Nymiera)

That wraps up this quest!

## Anju's Quest

Next, fly to Kristiline and make your way through the Church of Theolia portal to reach the Tower Cellar. Make your way through the wall in order to reach the room that is directly on the right of the entrance - you need to exit the wall, go right, then go right and up in the next room to accomplish this. Use the Darchlight Crystal to create a bridge, then walk into the rift in the next room.

To the right in the Crystal Fairytale area, you'll find the *Icium-Z*! Talk to Anju above, then her mother. Talk to Anju again, then find her at the top right for a third conversation. Pick up her Lillipup in the bottom left corner and return to Anju. Finally, head up for a battle.

!battle(["Anju",:ICEHEIRESS,0], "Fairy Tale Arena")

Use a Magical Seed or two if you get stuck!

Finally, head up once more to view the scene. You can catch **Regice**!

View one more scene and depart.

## Heart of Iron

Fly over to Route 9 and make your way over to the Axis High University. Enter the Axis Factory and enter the room immediately on the right and enter the rift.

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,10], "Short-Circuit Field")

This area is rather annoying: you can turn on the lights using a few switches scattered about, but they will automatically shut off shortly after. Try to get a glimpse of the floor tiles before the light goes off to figure out where you are as you traverse and defeat copies of the above Defense Mechanisms. Or, you can use my picture guide to keep your sanity:

!img("calgearn.png")

The five people we need to find are located at the tiles circled in pink. You can use a teleporter to reach a *Black Prism* (A) and pick up the *Dubious Disc* (B) and *Ancient Teachings* (C) in a bottom right room. 

Once you have gathered the entire group, enter the door at the top right.

!boss("KKING", "Short-Circuit Field")

Easy boss, easy life. Not so much for Clover, though. Capture **Registeel** then take the teleporter and rift to exit.

## Lake Spirits

So, the Lake Spirits have also just... appeared in their respective dens. We're going to go grab them. Make sure you have a GourmetTreat for each.

Fly to East Gearen and go to Goldenwood Park. Surf up at the very top of the hill to reach the Den of Verity to catch **Mesprit**!

Fly to Teila Resort and enter Aquamarine Cave. Down one floor you can dive on the large lake to reach the Den of Acuity. Catch **Uxie**!

Finally, fly over to Yui's Ranch and take a Braviary to Honec Woods. Exit Honec Woods to the west to reach the area with the Azelf Statue. Walk towards the shining star to reach the Den of Valor (not to be confused with Valor Mountain, of course) and catch **Azelf**!

**ZCell 142: Den of Valor**

!img("zcell142.png")

## Parks and Wrecks

For our next quest, fly over to East Gearen City. Make your way to the left backroom of the Lab to talk to Adrienn if you have completed *Reborn Again* and the Neo East Gearen Help Quests to begin a new quest: *Parks and Wrecks*.

Head over to the Magnolia Library, cut the nearby tree, and talk to Adrienn, Aya, and Jan then enter. Inside, talk to the poster in the back to discover a secret path! Follow it and take the elevator.

To the right you can read a journal. Do the same to the left, then interact with the panel to lower the shutter downstairs.

!battle(["Dr. Jenkel",:MADSCIENTIST,1], "Flower Garden Field")

This fight can catch you off guard - Alcremie and Musharna have decent synergy with the double-field combo of Misty Terrain overlaying Flower Garden Field. Hitting them with super-effective Physical moves is generally going to help you out here: Fire, Poison, and Steel in particular. The Ariados with Crest is a bit of a wildcard but you should be able to take it out with a super-effective move, too.

You'll be able to capture **Shaymin** above!

Return to Gearen Lab and talk to Adrienn. That concludes *Parks and Wrecks*!

## Missing Children 3

Fly over to Kristiline Town and enter Dylan's house if you have progressed *Missing Children* up to this point.

Head upstairs and talk to the statue, then go underground downstairs.

Talk to Ana to go to the 3rd Layer. Enter the building to the right. After a chat upstairs, head west across the bridge outside and enter the small building above. Pick up the *H-Disk* in the next room and use the teleporter.

Return to Dylan's house, then head over to the lift in the Underground. Use the H-Disk on the nearby machine to go down. Head up to take part in the "game".

The game explains it: every trainer you fight is one you will cause to be erased. A kill counter will be kept, though.

Up from the start:

!battle(["Tinia",:COOLTRAINER_F,0])

Right and down from here:

!battle(["Marsie",:LASS,0])

Down from here, a trainer will simply forfeit. Up and left from this room:

!battle(["Donovan",:COOLGUY,0])

Left from this room:

!battle(["Jordy",:YOUNGSTER,0])

Go right then down to cross the bridge with the others. Once you regain control, go right twice then up to reach the Key Bearer. Talk to them, then return to the door and go up when you are ready for a gauntlet of 2-3 fights! The gauntlet is only against 3 Pokemon... 3 BOSS Pokemon, that is, so prepare your team well.

!boss("NANODRIVE", "Colosseum Field")

She can set up quickly and steamroll you, but effects like Paralysis and dropped speed stick around. Lower her speed and cripple her to win.

!boss("NANODRIVE_1", "Colosseum Field")

One more fight. She'll try to hammer you with powerful Protean attacks, especially after an Omniboost on its last stage. Paralysis and Priority moves will be a great help here.

If you press V to give Ana back, you'll have to fight her as well:

!battle(["V",:INTERCEPTORV,0], "Colosseum Field")

The game keeps track of whether or not you win this fight, but winning is not required. If you do want to win, Trick Room on the first turn plus a few powerful Ground moves will easily do the trick.

Enter Dylan's house, then Peony's, then Particia's (downstairs).

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Peony sent me here. (Neutral)
- I wanted to check in! => Peony sent me. (Neutral)
- I wanted to check in! => It's true! Peony also sent me (+3 Particia)

Finally, return to Dylan's house. On the table is **Deino**! That's it for *Missing Children*!

## Xenogene Quest

Time for a big one! Enter Rhodea's Penthouse in Grand Dream City. There is a flier on the table about something going on at Pokestar Studios! Read this flier then head over there by exiting the complex and walking left. Head in to the theater on the right and follow Mr. Dyre Rektor...

Watch the film he shows, then head west outside to his office building and talk to him in the rightmost room. Accept the fast travel home and talk to the briefcase to get started. Return to the studio again and agree to start with Aelita in the lobby. Inside, you'll get the jist of how this sidequest goes: talk to your co-actors, direct from the chair, etc. Talk to the chair to begin filming the first part of the movie!

### Xenogene | Splicer's Revenge Act 1

Take some time to explore this part of the Movie World. Based on what I've read online, this quest is actually based on concepts from Zumi's scrapped game Pokemon Xenogene. It is cool to see at least part of the region and many of its characters realized in this sidequest in Rejuvenation!

Anyways, enter the building at the top of the area. Head downstairs at the top to "pick" a starter: it has to be Shinx, at the bottom.

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,0])

!battle(["Wynn",:XG_WYNN,0])

!battle(["Adelinde",:XG_ADELINDE,0])
