# .Karma Files

Head into the League Administration and talk to Erin in the middle room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Do what? (Neutral)
- Time to awaken Adrest. (Neutral)
- Your hair is nice today. (+1 Erin)

Accept the fast travel to the Field of Pillars and talk to the Obelisk to enter Zeight. Attempt to awaken Adrest above, then head up.

!battle(["Crescent",:INTERCEPTOR,0], "Deep Earth Field")

!move("CHTHONICMALADY")

The Deep Earth Field hasn't been explored much so far, so you'll likely be caught off guard by all of Crescent's tricks on it. In a nutshell this field makes all effects of weight and speed amplified in some way: Gyro Ball becomes max power (speedy Mega Metagross oneshots easily), Iron Ball modifies Speed directly (for Malamar, raises it), many moves like Dragon Rush and Icicle Crash, and Ground moves in general are boosted, and Gravity is always on. High priority moves like Sucker Punch and Vacuum Wave have their power lowered here, though lower priority moves like Vital Throw are boosted. You get to take advantage of all these things too, so get to reading those field notes if you are stuck. Be careful of Crescent's Gothitelle: it instantly uses its custom move when it is sent into battle, petrifying your Pokemon, lowering its stats, and Tormenting it. Plus, it has a Crest and two Shields.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Before awakening Adrest, talk to Crescent and say "You good?" (Neutral)
- Before awakening Adrest, talk to Crescent and say "Still crying?" (-1 Crescent)

After you win, wake up Adrest, then head up and around in this bizarre place.

You'll find yourself playing as the original Interceptor once more, in a cold, grey, mysterious world. Head right a few rooms and attempt to take the elevator. After a chat, try the elevator again. Read the journal entries.

Once you're back at the Obelisk, reenter. Grant Melia access.

You'll awaken in Zeight on the 8th. Talk to Erin in the second room from the right. Before we accept her request and continue .Karma Files... there are a bunch of sidequests that have opened up! Legendary ones!

While we're in Sashila Village, a new in-game trade has opened up. A girl is at the bottom of the village, just to the right of the bottom-rightmost house. She wants our Toxapex in exchange for a **Magikarp (Aevian)** named Hot Dog! How nice. Talk to the very same Toxapex afterward to give it a small loan of $100,000 to get *10 Pearls*, *3 Big Pearls*, a *Pearl String*, and the *Toxtricitite*!

## Legendary Quests

### Legendary Wings

Talk to the scientist with the hood in the League Administration to get the *Legendary Wings* quest. 

First, fly over to Evergreen Island. All the way on the southeast side of Route 11 is the Seabound Cave East; climb the stairs outside on its island to catch **Articuno**!

Next, fly over to Goldenleaf Town and head west to Goldenwood Forest. Cross the easternmost land bridge to catch **Zapdos**!

Finally, fly over to Teila Resort and follow the path through the Magrodar Crater. Catch **Moltres**!

Return to the scientist to finish this quest.

### Vivian's Regret

Fly to Sheridan and enter Carotos Mountain. Make your way through the Corrupted Cave to the Garufa Sanctuary. 

Inside the sanctuary, you'll see various Darchlight Crystals scattered about. Talk to each one of them to view a scene - eventually a glowing door in the left wing of the area will be unlocked. Head in, read the book, and show a Water type to the statue in order to activate one more Darchlight Crystal at the entrance. View that one, then head towards where we fought Groudon. Smash this Darchlight Crystal and enter the teleporter.

Step on the seven tiles in the next room to catch **Regirock**!

Nymiera will unlock one more seal and warp you to the door, so go up.

!boss("ADMIN", "Deep Earth Field")

Here's the thing: the way the boss's shields work means you cannot defeat it. The game does not expect you to defeat it. If you manage to break its shield 100 times though, the game rewards you by telling you you're wasting your time and treating it as a loss anyways! How to accomplish this, I leave as an exercise to the reader.

Destroy the terminal, or don't, then head out of this room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- After destroying the terminal: "Envoys were mistreated" (Neutral)
- After destroying the terminal: "Save Aelita from her fate" (Neutral)
- After destroying the terminal: "To Destroy Earth" (-999 Nymiera)
- After destroying the terminal: "To spite Admin" (-999 Nymiera)

That wraps up this quest!

### Anju's Quest

Next, fly to Kristiline and make your way through the Church of Theolia portal to reach the Tower Cellar. Make your way through the wall in order to reach the room that is directly on the right of the entrance - you need to exit the wall, go right, then go right and up in the next room to accomplish this. Use the Darchlight Crystal to create a bridge, then walk into the rift in the next room.

To the right in the Crystal Fairytale area, you'll find the *Icium-Z*! Talk to Anju above, then her mother. Talk to Anju again, then find her at the top right for a third conversation. Pick up her Lillipup in the bottom left corner and return to Anju. Finally, head up for a battle.

!battle(["Anju",:ICEHEIRESS,0], "Fairy Tale Arena")

Use a Magical Seed or two if you get stuck!

Finally, head up once more to view the scene. You can catch **Regice**!

View one more scene and depart.

### Heart of Iron

Fly over to Route 9 and make your way over to the Axis High University. Enter the Axis Factory and enter the room immediately on the right and enter the rift.

!battle(["Mechanisms",:DEFENSEMECH,10], "Short-Circuit Field")

This area is rather annoying: you can turn on the lights using a few switches scattered about, but they will automatically shut off shortly after. Try to get a glimpse of the floor tiles before the light goes off to figure out where you are as you traverse and defeat copies of the above Defense Mechanisms. Or, you can use my picture guide to keep your sanity:

!img("calgearn.png")

The five people we need to find are located at the tiles circled in pink. You can use a teleporter to reach a *Black Prism* (A) and pick up the *Dubious Disc* (B) and *Ancient Teachings* (C) in a bottom right room. 

Once you have gathered the entire group, enter the door at the top right.

!boss("KKING", "Short-Circuit Field")

Easy boss, easy life. Not so much for Clover, though. Capture **Registeel** then take the teleporter and rift to exit.

### Lake Spirits

So, the Lake Spirits have also just... appeared in their respective dens. We're going to go grab them. Make sure you have a GourmetTreat for each.

Fly to East Gearen and go to Goldenwood Park. Surf up at the very top of the hill to reach the Den of Verity to catch **Mesprit**!

Fly to Teila Resort and enter Aquamarine Cave. Down one floor you can dive on the large lake to reach the Den of Acuity. Catch **Uxie**!

Finally, fly over to Yui's Ranch and take a Braviary to Honec Woods. Exit Honec Woods to the west to reach the area with the Azelf Statue. Walk towards the shining star to reach the Den of Valor (not to be confused with Valor Mountain, of course) and catch **Azelf**!

**ZCell 142: Den of Valor**

!img("zcell142.png")

### Parks and Wrecks

For our next quest, fly over to East Gearen City. Make your way to the left backroom of the Lab to talk to Adrienn if you have completed *Reborn Again* and the Neo East Gearen Help Quests to begin a new quest: *Parks and Wrecks*.

Head over to the Magnolia Library, cut the nearby tree, and talk to Adrienn, Aya, and Jan then enter. Inside, talk to the poster in the back to discover a secret path! Follow it and take the elevator.

To the right you can read a journal. Do the same to the left, then interact with the panel to lower the shutter downstairs.

!battle(["Dr. Jenkel",:MADSCIENTIST,1], "Flower Garden Field")

This fight can catch you off guard - Alcremie and Musharna have decent synergy with the double-field combo of Misty Terrain overlaying Flower Garden Field. Hitting them with super-effective Physical moves is generally going to help you out here: Fire, Poison, and Steel in particular. The Ariados with Crest is a bit of a wildcard but you should be able to take it out with a super-effective move, too.

You'll be able to capture **Shaymin** above!

Return to Gearen Lab and talk to Adrienn. That concludes *Parks and Wrecks*!

## Missing Children 3

Fly over to Kristiline Town and enter Dylan's house if you have progressed *Missing Children* up to this point.

Head upstairs and talk to the statue, then go underground downstairs.

Talk to Ana to go to the 3rd Layer. Enter the building to the right. After a chat upstairs, head west across the bridge outside and enter the small building above. Pick up the *H-Disk* in the next room and use the teleporter.

Return to Dylan's house, then head over to the lift in the Underground. Use the H-Disk on the nearby machine to go down. Head up to take part in the "game".

The game explains it: every trainer you fight is one you will cause to be erased. A kill counter will be kept, though.

Up from the start:

!battle(["Tinia",:COOLTRAINER_F,0])

Right and down from here:

!battle(["Marsie",:LASS,0])

Down from here, a trainer will simply forfeit. Up and left from this room:

!battle(["Donovan",:COOLGUY,0])

Left from this room:

!battle(["Jordy",:YOUNGSTER,0])

Go right then down to cross the bridge with the others. Once you regain control, go right twice then up to reach the Key Bearer. Talk to them, then return to the door and go up when you are ready for a gauntlet of 2-3 fights! The gauntlet is only against 3 Pokemon... 3 BOSS Pokemon, that is, so prepare your team well.

!boss("NANODRIVE", "Colosseum Field")

She can set up quickly and steamroll you, but effects like Paralysis and dropped speed stick around. Lower her speed and cripple her to win.

!boss("NANODRIVE_1", "Colosseum Field")

One more fight. She'll try to hammer you with powerful Protean attacks, especially after an Omniboost on its last stage. Paralysis and Priority moves will be a great help here.

If you press V to give Ana back, you'll have to fight her as well:

!battle(["V",:INTERCEPTORV,0], "Colosseum Field")

The game keeps track of whether or not you win this fight, but winning is not required. If you do want to win, Trick Room on the first turn plus a few powerful Ground moves will easily do the trick.

Enter Dylan's house, then Peony's, then Particia's (downstairs).

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Peony sent me here. (Neutral)
- I wanted to check in! => Peony sent me. (Neutral)
- I wanted to check in! => It's true! Peony also sent me (+3 Particia)

Finally, return to Dylan's house. On the table is **Deino**! That's it for *Missing Children*!

## Xenogene Splicer's Revenge Quest

Time for a big one! Enter Rhodea's Penthouse in Grand Dream City. There is a flier on the table about something going on at Pokestar Studios! Read this flier then head over there by exiting the complex and walking left. Head in to the theater on the right and follow Mr. Dyre Rektor...

Watch the film he shows, then head west outside to his office building and talk to him in the rightmost room. Accept the fast travel home and talk to the briefcase to get started. Return to the studio again and agree to start with Aelita in the lobby. Inside, you'll get the jist of how this sidequest goes: talk to your co-actors, direct from the chair, etc. Make sure you talk to all the co-actors and crew as well as attempt to enter the bathroom between every shoot to get maximal rewards. Talk to the chair to begin filming the first part of the movie!

### Recording Session 1

Take some time to explore this part of the Movie World. Based on what I've read online, this quest is actually based on concepts from Zumi's scrapped game Pokemon Xenogene. It is cool to see at least part of the region and many of its characters realized in this sidequest in Rejuvenation!

Anyways, enter the building at the top of the area. Head downstairs at the top to "pick" a starter: it has to be Shinx, at the bottom.

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,0])

!battle(["Wynn",:XG_WYNN,0])

!battle(["Adelinde",:XG_ADELINDE,0])

### Recording Session 2

Once you return to the studio, talk to the characters around the building, then sit back in the Director's chair.

Explore the area a bit if you wish - none of the exploration is required and your movie-Pokemon don't gain Exp. You can battle some trainers here.

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,1])

!battle(["Theano",:SCIENTIST,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Silvester",:CAMPER,0], "City Field")

This trainer gives you a *Awakening*.

!battle(["Brian",:WORKERM,0], "City Field")

This trainer gives you a *Potion*. You can also find two *Super Potions*, two *Potions*, and a *Full Heal* around the city. A person in the center gives you two *Oran Berries*.

!battle(["Eugeneia",:POKEMONRANGER_M,0], "City Field")

This trainer gives you a *Revive*.

To progress the film, enter the Gym. Talk to the person at the top of the room, then to the woman at the desk below. Talk to the gym leader for a battle!

!battle(["Enya",:XG_ENYA,0])

You'll be taken to the Garbage Dump. Fun fact: the theme that played in the Nightmare School was originally created to be played in this area in the Xenogene game.

!partner(["Wynn",:XG_WYNN,1])

There is an *Antidote* in the bottom corner.

!battle(["Viviana",:FAIRYGIRL,0], "Wasteland Field")

This trainer gives you a *Pecha Berry*. Head right to learn we need to find some tools. A rusty blue shovel is above, and a heavy black box is below. You can use the blue shovel to the left on some blue boxes.

!battle(["Trash & Vermin",:POKEGANG9,0], "Wasteland Field")

You will get a purple shovel. Use it at the top left corner of the area to reach a *Potion* and another pile of trash, where we can use the black box from earlier to progress.

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,2])

!battle(["Vidas",:TOURIST,0], "Wasteland Field")

Pick up the heavy box towards the bottom and use it above at the ramp. In the top left corner is a red shovel, which you can use on two sets of boxes below. From here, go to the bottom right corner to use it a third time.

!battle(["Kyz",:ROCKER,0], "Wasteland Field")

You'll get a *Revive* from him and find a *Super Potion* above. Pick up the golden shovel. You can use the golden shovel in the top left to get a *Max Revive*, then use it on the right side of the area to proceed.

!boss("BOSSRATICATE", "Wasteland Field")

You can count on Wynn using Rock Blast while being sensible with your own team to win this fight.

While you're back in the studio, talk to the Director's chair one more time to see a scene outside. Back inside, if you've been talking to the cast throughout the quest, talk to Kai to get a *Thank-You Card*.

### Recording Session 3

Using the same team we had previously, time for a fight!

!battle(["Lucile",:XG_LUCILE,0])

This battle can actually be pretty tough for this team. I recommend using Toxic Spikes and stalling as much as possible by keeping Sandyghast alive with Mega Drain and using Detect on Meditite. Your character will win the Voltaic Badge!

!newself(["Saber",:XG_SABER,2])

!partner(["Adelinde",:XG_ADELINDE,1])

Head left.

!battle(["Lyra",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

Enter this room.

!battle(["Liam",:XG_GRUNTM,0])

A *Revive* is to the right.

!battle(["Ophelia",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

Deactivate this terminal. Back in the central room, go right.

!battle(["Elias",:XG_GRUNTM,0])

Enter this room.

!dbattle(["Matthew",:XG_GRUNTM,0], ["Lucida",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

!battle(["Andrea",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

!battle(["Lucas",:XG_GRUNTM,0])

Deactivate both terminals. Back in the central room, go up.

!battle(["Helena",:XG_GRUNTF,0])

Head down the elevator to begin a stealth section. Grab the *Super Potion* and *Revive* and deactivate all six terminals as you proceed.

!battle(["Sierra",:XG_SIERRA,0])

### Red Carpet Premiere

Talk to Kai once you are ready to watch the premiere of the film! That completes this quest officially, but there are still a bunch of rewards to grab.

First, reenter the studio and try to enter the bathroom. You will get the *Blunder Policy*! Next, head into the dressing room if you got the Thank-You Note to receive a new outfit! Finally, talk to Dyre to get $25000!

Head over to the graveyard in the District of Hope. You'll see Zumi here and receive *5 Max Revives*, plus the *A. Ampharos Crest* if you got the Thank-You Note.

Head to the Gearen Lab and enter the Developer Area. Downstairs, Zumi will give you a challenge to beat three Xenogene trainers with your team.

!battle(["Adelinde",:XG_ADELINDE,2], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Enya",:XG_ENYA,1], "Icy Field")

!battle(["Wynn",:XG_WYNN,2], "Colosseum Field")

For defeating all three, you will get the *Rillaboomite*, *Cinderacite*, and *Inteleonite*! 

## Continuing .Karma Files

That wraps up all the sidequest and legendary acquisition for the time being. Fly back to Sashila to continue the Paragon .Karma Files content! Talk to Erin to accept travel to Mika's Coffee.

### .Karma File: Crescent

**Relationship Point Choices**:

!shop("Somniam Mall Pokeballs", ["Moon Ball", "Heavy Ball", "Friend Ball", "Love Ball", "Level Ball", "Fast Ball", "Lure Ball"])

Sadly, nine stamps is the maximum we can get in V13.5. Someday we'll be able to enter Goocci. Someday.

Talk to Melia on the left side of the mall.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- They're just like your old friends. (-1 Crescent)

Next, head down to the Night Market and meet with Ren on the right side.

**Relationship Point Choices**:

- I miss Robo-Ren... (Neutral)
- Yikes. (-2 Ren)

Once you are back in Zeight with Melia and Nancy:

**Relationship Point Choices**:

- Maybe we're screwed... (-2 Melia)
- No idea. (Neutral)

### .Karma File: Ren

If Florin is alive, you'll get the following section. Accept the fast travel to the Treasure Treehouse. 

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- How are things, Huey? (+2 Huey, +3 Reina, +2 Lavender)
- Sup. (Neutral)
- Ignore (-2 Huey, -2 Lavender, -4 Reina)

Head over to the Somniam Mall to investigate the fountains. Talk to the bottom fountain in the dining area from above.

!boss("STARMIEGOD", "Water Surface")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Do it anyway! (Neutral)
- Robo-Ren would break. (+2 Ren)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Not cool, Ren! (Neutral)
- Okay, you got me. (+2 Ren)
- I wasn't scared... (+1 Ren)
- You're an idiot. (-1 Ren)

Pop over to the Somniam Mall to get 3 Zinc, then head to the Hospital of Hope graveyard. The middle grave on the left side row, second from the bottom, is the one we want to talk to.

!battle(["Haggie",:CHANELLER,0], "City Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Me too... (+2 Ren)
- So there's no ghost? (Neutral)
- We should take the Zinc (-2 Ren)

Next, talk to the mailbox above the Pokemon Center in the Judicial District.

Head east to the Dream District and enter the Beautifly Boutique to the right of the Pokemon Center. Buy specifically the Ruby Red Headpiece, Ruby Red Coat, then Dark Jeans in that order.

Back outside, take a train to Central Square, then again to Somniam Mall.

Go next to Mika's Cafe and talk to Patty. A wild Sinistea will appear!

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Oof... My stomach... (+3 Ren)
- It wasn't that bad. (+1 Ren)
- I liked it. (+1 Ren)
- Rumbly Tumbly... (Neutral)

Finally, head up to the 100th floor of the Central Building. You can insert all of the beads we've collected so far to proceed. We get to fight a gym leader!

!battle(["Talon",:LEADER_TALON,0], "Sky Field")

Wait wait wait. Another Strong Winds fight on the Sky Field? You have to be kidding me. Frankly this one is a lot less miserable than Souta was though. Win against Talon to finish this section!

You'll be returned to Rhodea's Penthouse.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If Venam Points >= 10, say "I haven't noticed." (+3 Venam)
- Say "Yeah I have..." (Neutral)

Talk to Lavender to continue.

### .Karma File: Venam

After a chat in Tesla's kitchen, talk to Amber in her room.

Upstairs, we will be having a 6v6 tag battle!

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT_3,7])

!dbattle(["Amber",:LEADER_AMBER,2], ["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM3,4], "Volcanic Top Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- They're just coping. (+2 Aelita)
- Sore losers, both of em... (Neutral)

Attempt to head outside and you will talk to Crawli, then fly over to Jynnobi pass and head up to Route 6. Enter the first battleship, then go down the ladder when prompted.

!battle(["Officia",:XENANALYST_F,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Press a switch at the top - this will let you jump over some boxes to go down and right.

!battle(["Voluptate",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Jump across at the bottom right to press another button. This will allow you to hop to the center-bottom area and press another button. Hop over to the bottom left corner and push the final button.

!battle(["Praesent",:XENMAGE_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're right... (+2 Venam)
- Hm... (Neutral)
- I'm not so sure... (+2 Aelita)

Back on Route 6, surf to the bottom and talk to Crawli.

Enter the living room in Tesla's Villa to finish up our Terajuma vacation.

### .Karma File: Alice & Allen

Talk to Erin. At Fort Rystrine, find her and Kanon to the right.

When you are yourself again, prepare for a gauntlet?? You don't have to win any of these fights right now, but we will need to complete the gauntlet eventually. I will cover completing this gauntlet later on when it is necessary... though if you get it out of the way now, great for you!

Follow Kanon to Fort Rystrine. Once you have control again, follow Crescent to the very tip of Zorrialyn Coast.

After a conversation in Oblitus Town, you will be given the chance to activate Interceptor's Wish (though, with no battles, this doesn't do anything).

As Melia, talk to Erin. After Lavender's Alakazam does its thing, interact with the blob at the very top.

As yourself again, reenter Zeight. You'll again be asked to activate Interceptor's Wish, I decline. 

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_2,5])

Defeat or run from the first Regice. In the next area, head up for a harder fight.

!boss("ICESOLDIER", "Frozen Dimensional Field")

### .Karma File: Damien & Alexandra

Once you're back in Zeight, you'll be able to see the progress we've made on the Karma Files so far. You can also attempt the gauntlet from earlier again at the computer.

Exit Zeight and read the note from Gliscor. Head to Alamissa Urben next to find Ryland in the center...!

Down and left you'll find Suicune.

!boss("GERBIL2", "Desert Field")

The fight dramatically changes after a shield break: par for the course for a boss battle by now. What you should know is that you can actually catch **Suicune** once all of its shields have broken!

On the right side of the area, you'll find Raikou.

!boss("GERBIL3", "Desert Field")

As before, once all its shields are broken, you can catch **Raikou**!

Finally, in the top left of Alamissa is Entei.

!boss("GERBIL1", "Desert Field")

Break all the shields to catch **Entei**!

### .Karma Files: Erin & Aelita

Enter the Rose Theater for the event. Talk to Crescent in the hot spring on the right:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Extreme sadness. (Neutral)
- Hopelessness (Neutral)
- Happiness! (+1 Crescent)
- What is this question?! (-2 Crescent)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's okay to remember. (+2 Crescent)
- Don't forget them. (-2 Crescent)

Talk to Texen in the spa over, too. Inside, you can talk to various characters in the rooms on the left, and to Aelita and Eldest outside on the left. 

Talk to Erin in the upstairs room when you are ready to proceed, then to the Kimono Girl in the restaurant. Return to Erin.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Is it handwritten? (+2 Erin)
- Can you tell who wrote it? (Neutral)

Talk to Texen in the spring and return to Erin. Climb the ladder that appears in the hallway. Next, enter the theater downstairs from the bottom.

!dbattle(["Sesilia",:KIMONOGIRL2,1], ["Enya",:KIMONOGIRL2,1], "Beach Field")

Return to the theater and enter the pocket dimension upstairs.

*Special Scene: Erin's Secret* requires 10+ Relationship Points with Erin at this point.

### Zeight Gauntlet

At this point, you need to finally defeat the gauntlet in Zeight. This works similar to Glass in Reborn: your Pokemon will be fully healed between fights, but fallen Pokemon will not be revived.

!battle(["01010010 01110110",:TREAT_01,0], "Deep Earth Field")

!battle(["01000001 01000101",:TREAT_02,0], "Deep Earth Field")

!battle(["01001101",:TREAT_03,0], "Deep Earth Field")

Gauntlets are very rough. You train the whole game to get used to using Pokemon in such a way that getting one knockout per Pokemon is enough to win a fight. A gauntlet like this one makes it so that each of your Pokemon has to knock out three Pokemon on average. And the opponents here are all of our allies with their very powerful and varied teams, meaning winning this gauntlet is no small feat. Whether it's training new team members, playing with trial-and-error to figure out where the AI will target its attacks in each fight so you can gain some momentum, etc.

The good news with this gauntlet is that you have a lot of room to work with on the Deep Earth Field as well as via a move like Trick Room. There are tons of ways to slow your Pokemon down on the Deep Earth Field - making use of them to steamroll your opponents' mostly fast teams is probably the easiest strategy here. Similarly you can opt for a way to overwhelm them with speed control: Sticky Web, Tailwind, Sun/Chlorophyll or Rain/Swift Swim, etc. can all be very viable here. The game has been generous enough to give you a bunch of really strong tools by this point in the game - abuse them to the best of your ability to come out on top.

### .Karma File: Amber

In the concert hall, you get to press left and right to choose the music. Once you are done, end the concert.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- With Amber Points >= 10 and having Saved Amber at Valor, watch the concert (+3 Amber, +2 Aelita)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- They'd support you. (+1 Amber)
- They'd probably laugh. (-1 Amber)
- Maybe they'd cringe. (+2 Amber)

### End of Night: Obliteration

In Amberette Town, enter the portal for another gauntlet. Thankfully, you will be fully healed between these two bosses.

!boss("TIEMPAGOOD", "Deep Earth Field")

The fight against Tiempa shouldn't be too terrible, all things considered. Her gimmick is making you really slow, which means you have to say goodbye to speed control. That is, unless you opt for Trick Room, in which case winning this one shouldn't be too bad with a few strong super effective moves.

!boss("SPACEAGOOD", "Deep Earth Field")

Spacea is another beast altogether. Ignore the "Minior" autogenerated above: for every shield you break... Spacea will just STEAL YOUR POKEMON. Like, it faints from being on your side, then appears on her side to fight you. If there is a silver lining to speak of, its that she likes to use Surf, meaning you can opt for Protect or Wide Guard to have her faint your own Pokemon. This also means there's a bit of gaming to do in regards to *which* Pokemon you let her have - the lower their HP, the more easily you can knock them out. With very careful planning, you even can let her steal a Pokemon with Water Absorb that doesn't have much offensive power to even the playing field - she can't steal a new Pokemon while she already has an ally.

You'll find yourself in the cold, grey, mysterious world once again. Interact with the glowy thingy below.

Erin will ask you for two passwords. Of course, they are "POKEMON" and "REJUVENATION".

After reading the files, head up at the Zorrialyn Coast.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're not an outlier... (Neutral)
- Is this really okay? (-2 Crescent)
- It was a good idea. (+1 Crescent)

That is a wrap on the .Karma Files content for the Paragon Route :]

## Post Game Content

Oh, by the way. If you managed to grind your way to 999 Black Prisms, you can get **Necrozma** by asking Mr. Luck for ??? and going to Rhodea's Penthouse. Have fun with that.
