Explore the route a bit. There is also an Audino Breeder in the area, each time you win, you will get 7 *Exp. Candy L*.

At the top, you'll find:

Head down to the bottom part of the route. Here, you'll encounter wild Sandygast.

Hidden on Route 9, you'll find a *Calcium, Carbos, Big Mushroom, Resist Wing*, and *Swift Wing*.

Surf up and around to the right here. At the top, you'll find:

ZCell 075: Route 9

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image77.png"/>

Back on the main part of the route, enter the first cave entrance on the right.

Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard*, then head into the room at the top with the crystal and pick up a hidden *Pretty Wing* as well as:

ZCell 076: Forlorned Cavern

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image78.png"/>

That's all we can do in this section of the cave, so head back out and go to the left, where the hiker is, and enter this cavern. At the top, use rock climb to grab an *Ability Capsule*. There's also a *Dusk Stone* hidden behind the rock smash path at the bottom. Pick up the hidden *Mineral Ball* and *Ether* as you go to the right.

Exit at the top right, then pick up the hidden *Muscle Wing* and follow the path to the next cave entrance. There is a hidden *Clever Wing* and *Soda Pop* along this path: follow it to get *TM35 Flamethrower*! The tree here also has hidden *Honey* in it.

That's all the exploring we can do for now, so head towards the northwest portion of the route, then approach the Rose Theater. Use cut on the bamboo on the left side to encounter **Komala**! Surf across:

ZCell 077: Route 9

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image79.png"/>

Enter the theater.

## Rose Theater First Visit

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Don't be so harsh... (Aelita -2)
- Stop being ignorant! (Aelita -4)
- You did what you had to do. (Aelita -1)

Once you regain control, head through either of the two hallways and enter the stage. Talk to Ayuna and agree to help her find her Kimono Sisters. This starts a quest that we'll get to in just a bit.

While you're in this room, head to the southeast to grab:

ZCell 078: Rose Theater

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image80.png"/>

Exit the southwestern most door of the theater, and you'll grab *TM120 Solar Blade*. There is also a hidden *Fresh Water* nearby. Exit the southeasternmost door to grab a *Flying Memory*. If you exit one of the top doors of the theatre, you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball* and listen in on a conversation between Souta and Eldest.

Head upstairs, and into the left door.


## Judicial District

Outside, accept Aelita's request for fast travel. There are a couple side quests and areas we can tackle right now. Skip two sections ahead for the story bits.

From the east side of Dream District East, we can access the Judicial District. You already came here if you exposed Flora, but here I'm covering the optional content within.

ZCell 079: Judicial District

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image81.png"/>

Also, use your Itemfinder here for a *Link Heart*.

At night, turn the weather to Thunderstorm via one of the monitors, and catch a **Tynamo** with a GourmetTreat.

Head into the upper left building and talk to the guy on the top floor. Head back to Dream District West and talk to the museum owner and the guy near him, then return to the interested buyer. Return to the museum to learn of the painting's fate! We'll get the thief later.

In the Police Station, head down to the lost and found. This area allows you to catch up on limited time items, so grab any you missed while you're here. You can also look at the criminals on B2F. You may be wondering what Cleffa did to land itself there, but *trust me on this one, you don't want to know*.

That's it for now: we'll start the Kimono Girls' side quest now.

## Kimono Girls Quest

We are going to find all the Kimono girls.

- Kimono Girl Beatrice: First: Judicial District Police Department. But she needs us to do something first. Head to Route 9 and go to the beach and fight the white-haired guy here. Afterwards, return to Beatrice.

To conclude the SPU Parcel quest, talk to the guy at the desk of the police station, and give him the final parcel. Head back to the trucker. Talk to him, and he'll activate an encounter on Route 9 that we will get to in a bit.

- Kimono Girl Lana: First, northwest Dream District outside of Ruka's Cafe. Head down into the Residential District.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Uh... Yeah. (Damien +1)
- No clue. (Neutral)

Next, you'll find her at Nightmare City (Left side of second map). Save her from **Sableye**. Then, meet at the Dream District Northwest area again.

- Kimono Girl Efi: Grand Dream Gate (east of GDC entrance). She will give you a *Pearl*.
- Kimono Girl Midori: Oblitus Town (top, behind the decrepit gym)
- Kimono Girl Sesilia: Sensu Meadow (right side of the maze area). Answer no to her question.
- Kimono Girl Eyna: Honec Woods (shrine area to the west of the main area)
- Kimono Girl Ruka: Route 9 (Where the Flamethrower T.M. was, via Forlorned Cave)

On our way back, enter the cave entrance on Route 9 to the north of where we fought the white-haired guy. If we do, we can get **Dewpider**.

Once you've found them all, next, head back to the Rose Theater and talk to Ayuna. You're going to have to fight all 8 Eeveelutions in a row, at Level 80-82. Set up the best team possible and take them on. Win, and you'll get Eevee with special moves and an *Ice Stone*! Head down to talk to the hiker in the crowd, to get your second *Department Store Stamp*!

Start to the right. The guy nearby will sell you a Chatot for $15000. Grab the *Ether* down from here. The girl to the right is a tutor.

Axis High University Move Tutor (Right)

| Move          | Price            |
|---------------|------------------|
|Water Pledge   |3 Blue Shards     |
|Grass Pledge   |3 Green Shards    |
|Fire Pledge    |3 Red Shards      |

Up in the upper right corner, you'll find the Name Rater and the Move Relearner, next to a *Green Shard*. Neat.

Talk to the high striker machine here. Pay the price, then it will randomly payoff as follows:

|Outcome       |Chance          |
|--------------|----------------|
|*HM06 Dive*   | 2%             |
|*Poke Doll*  | 14%            |
| Fee refunded | 22%            |
| Nothing      | 62%            |

Note that the first time you get the Poke Doll prize, it will actually be a **Stufful**!

So, grab what you need from here. Talk to the guy on the left and give him a Blue Shard in exchange for a puzzle! Here is the solution:

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image82.png"/>

[This link](https://www.rebornevo.com/forums/topic/29088-timburr-puzzle-strategy-guide-4x4-rotation/) may be helpful for solving this type of puzzle.

Once you win, you'll get **Darumaka**.

On the left, there are more vendors.

Talk to the guy on the left. He'll offer us a chance at a little game, depending on which bait we buy. Standard bait is $2000, Delicious bait is $7500, and Gourmet bait is $20000. Here's a breakdown of what you can get for each:

Standard Bait

| *Dawn Stone*      |20%    |
| *Dusk Stone*      |20%    |

We can catch Wishiwashi elsewhere, and we also can buy Sail and Jaw Fossils elsewhere, so this is primarily useful right now for the evolution items and Horsea.

|*Air Balloon*|$200 |

Once you're done exploring the area, talk to Erin at the top.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're on! (Aelita +1, Adam +2)
- Uh... No thanks. (Aelita -1, Adam -2)

Pop Star Risa Raider (No Field)
-   Tuff-Puff Jigglypuff, Level 85. @ Air Balloon.
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Draco Meteor
    -   Flamethrower

This is a 1v1. You don't have to win this one though. So, this may seem to be Jigglypuff, but it has the same ability, moves, and base stats as a different Pokemon, but the same typing as normal... anyways, this is a very winnable battle, you just must find something with a powerful Poison or Steel move that can survive all four of these attacks.

## District of Hope

Head west from Axis High, then head into the first building. Grab the *Thunderstone* on 15F. Outside, head to the south. Grab the hidden *GourmetTreat, Green Shard*, *Persim Berry, Blue Shard*, and *Aspear Berry*, as well as the *Soda Pop* behind the dumpster.

After exploring a bit, head north through the gate. Pick up hidden *Super Repel, Elixir, Rock Gem*, and *Yellow Shard*. Enter the Hospital of Hope and enter the door on the left side. After a lengthy scene, head back out.

Fast travel to the Rose Theater! Enter the Theater and enter the right room upstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices**:

- This is stupid. (Kanon -2, Erin +2)

Activate the crystal - we're going back in.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes (Vivian +1)
- Uh... (Vivian -1)

Next you have to fight a Level 1 Deoxys. Obviously it is easy, but for relationship points losing grants (Aelita -1, Vivian -1) and running away grants (Aelita -2, Vivian -2).

Get $5000 from Katsu in Kugearen, Once in Amberette Town, enter the right house and get the *Time Gear Amulet*!

Take the driver to Kugearen then go east through the woods to get to Sheridan Village.

| Shiftry      | 5        |
| Pinsir       | 5        |

Grab the *Max Repel* here and item find to get *Ultra Ball* and *Tiny Mushroom*.

Chase this Heracross into the bottom right part of the forest, then sneak underneath the twigs in the bottom left corner of that area to get to Heracross. Run to the back part of the forest. Then, re-enter the village after Aelita's amulet gets taken. Talk to Aelita by the berries.

Go upstairs and interact with the table to get the *Garufa Spellbook*. Head down the stairs after the scene.

    -   Toxic

    -   Psychic
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Focus Blast
    -   Calm Mind

This one honestly isn't too bad, but her team does make good use of the field. Her Mega Alakazam will outspeed most Pokemon and its field boosted Psychic is brutal, so you want to find some way to outspeed and one shot it. Watch out for the Assault Vest pair - they can eat up super-effective moves easily and hit back with wide coverage. If you've gotten this far though this battle won't be too much trouble.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You okay? (Melia +2)
- What's up? (Neutral)
- Can we leave now? (Melia -1)

## Aevium (Alt. Future)

After the battle, you'll be whisked away. After a few scenes, head up and into the cave. After you regain control, talk to Amber in the garden, then Kenneth in the cave. Go to sleep.

Next, you'll regain control in a jail cell on the Renegade ship. Talk to Granny to get blankets, then to Kenneth, then to the egg.

Head down one level and avoid the shattered glass as you beat grunts. Push the red button. Head up another level. The PC and healing star are here. Beat the grunts as you push the blue and yellow buttons in this room. Head up again and go past the dead lasers, then up the stairs. Follow the path.

    -   Recover

As in her last fight the Swift Swim can catch you off guard, but this team is certainly much less threatening. Electricity tears through most of it as before, and a Ghost / Psychic / Dark core can also do wonders here. You can do it!

Head back up and outside to the deck.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We needed a new sail... (Melia +2)
- She loves her new job. (Melia +1)

- Why does it matter? (Melia -2)
- It's necessary. (Melia +2)

And, if you have at least 5 Melia Relationship Points at this point, you'll get another (Melia +5).

Head down to the bottom to talk to them all again. Once you wake up, exit the boat via the deck. Follow the path and watch the scenes.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We must press on (Melia +2, Keta +2)

    -   Swords Dance

A bit harder of a fight this time, but still nothing intense. Aevian Lapras can be threatening, as can Lucario if it gets off a Swords Dance. Otherwise, though you should be able to set something up against Banette or Muk and sweep if you need to.

Up ahead, we're going through a maze. The order of doors we must go through to complete it is as follows: LUURULDD. If you complete the maze in time, you'll be granted (Melia +5) Relationship Points.

Next is a battle against Melia.

    -   Gilded Arrow
    -   Nasty Plot
    -   Dazzling Gleam

This is a tough fight this time around! Every one of her Pokemon are pretty threatening in some way. Zoroark likes to prank you and murder with field boosted Sucker Punch - so know that it will be disguised as Togekiss, or Gardevoir if Togekiss is dead, etc. If Meganium gets off an Ancient Power with boost, you might be screwed as it will never die thanks to its crest! Gardevoir is also very fast, and field boosted Psychic is no joke. That said, you can overwhelm her: half of her team is weak to Poison and the other half Fighting, for example. You can also try to set up your own tank - if she can't sufficiently set up this may work.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- About what?
- Sigh (Melia -3)

Time for a story choice.
-   If you choose Hand it Over, well... you're gonna get a game over. A
    game over that in fact will write to your save that you made that
    choice should you click Try Again. If that's what you want, go for
    it. But if not, better make sure you have a backup if you want to
    see how that route plays out.
-   Abandon Them is a passing grade! The story will continue fine, but
    it's not the perfect ending.
-   Do Nothing, i.e., let the timer run out, is the answer that will get
    you towards the best ending.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay?! (Melia +2)
- uh... You good? (Neutral)
- What happened? (Neutral)

Time to play as Melia. Follow the path!

The news is good: Melia is your ally, so this is a 12v6. Pretty hard to lose this one, thankfully.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We have to go. (Neutral)
- It was fun. (Neutral)

## Classified Information Quest

### HQuest 27: Classified Information Take the request and talk to the person by the elevator to get to the 36F of the building.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I was terrified too... (Melia +2)
- It's standard procedure. (Melia +1)
- Grow up. (Melia -2)

Catch some z's at the penthouse, then in the nightmare, head up and talk to Anabel. After your conversation, wake up, and return to the 36F of  central. Accept Looker's travel request to Darchlight Caves.

Using the mirror, make your way all the way through the cave, back to the ladder paths. Take the right ladder and cross when it is dark to see the group. Follow the path and watch the scenes.

Back at HQ, go into the left room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:

- Glad to help. (Melia +3, Erick +2)
- I kinda got baited into this... (Erick +3, Melia +2)
- Eh... (Erick +1, Melia -2)

Talk to Looker again to return to the lab. Talk to the door while in the hallway and present the Rose Badge to the door. Inside, grab the  *Rift Notes: Code Drifio*.

Dimensional Rift Ferrothorn (Burning Field)
-   Ferrothorn, Level 75. @ Metronome. Type: Fire/Steel. Ability: Shift. 3 Shields.
    -   Steamroller
    -   Fire Lash
    -   Iron Head
    -   Earthquake

Phase 1 Base Stats: 300/80/240/80/250/115. Phase 2 Base Stats: 600/250/200/80/200/240.

This is a tough battle. It has two forms - the second comes out as soon as you destroy all three shields. Luckily the first only has 80 base attack, meaning you can take advantage of the beginning of the battle to completely abuse it. Lower its attack by six stages, its accuracy if you want, whichever defense stat you plan to attack to knock it out, even its speed so much that you can outspeed it even with its 240-base speed. Due to its typing, Earthquake or Earth Power might be your strongest choices.

Once you emerge victorious, talk to Looker and Anabel on 36F to get the *Rift Notes*.

Return to the help center to get $25000 and the third Department Store Stamp!

At some point, head back to the room where you fought Ferrothorn, interact with the panel in the back, then enter the right room. Read the journal and use the Itemfinder in here to get *Dubious Disc*!

GameFreak, about 8 years ago, did something interesting. They upped the BST ceiling from the impressive 720 in the god of Pokemon Arceus to 780, in Rayquaza's mega form. What's more, they gave Mega Rayquaza the ability Delta Stream, its own custom weather. But, in order to make Delta Stream stand out above lame Air Lock, they made a couple changes. For one, it neutralizes all Ice, Electric, and Rock moves used against flying types, greatly improving its defensive capabilities as now Mega-Rayquaza only must field three 2x weaknesses instead of three plus a 4x weakness, and gains a resistance. Second, to fit the lore, Delta Stream  cannot be overwritten by any other weather. It was so strong the Smogon  tier literally called "Uber" could not contain the power levels of this creature, leading to the creation of the "Anything Goes" tier. So,  Mega-Rayquaza is busted, and its ability is a big part of why.

Thankfully Delta Stream does come with a few drawbacks though. The four
(4) lines named Golduck, Drampa, Altaria, and Lickilicky can block it out via Cloud Nine, so even though these four are not particularly good otherwise they have a purpose - simply sending one out at the same time as Mega-Rayquaza opens up its 4x Ice and Rock weaknesses... but that effect only lasts as long as they're in battle, so it's not really significant. The other, more significant thing may seem like a no-brainer, but is still notable. Like Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon's signature weathers, when Mega-Rayquaza exits the battlefield, it's signature weather also leaves with it. So, a singles team of all Flying types boasting Mega-Rayquaza cannot all benefit from the effect, since once Mega-Rayquaza leaves the field so does the rest of the team's safety from their weaknesses.

So, with all this in mind, what happens when a game, maybe whose name begins with "P" and ends with "okemon Rejuvenation", decides to just... have this weather always on for an entire 6v6 fight? Against all Flying Pokemon? On top of a field effect that already significantly strengthens Flying types via various ability and move buffs? What happens when this weather does *not* only remain on the field when a single Pokemon is out, when the player is faced with dealing with a nearly weakness-less team under all circumstances except bringing out one of four random Pokemon with Cloud Nine? The answers to all these questions, I believe are simple. That is, I, BIGJRA, writer of this gargantuan guide, have quite a tough time. And you might too!

His first mon comes in, a Skarmory that will likely cripple your lead as it has Sturdy and an insane field boosted Sky Attack. It also has an Elemental Seed, guaranteeing Souta 8 turns of free tailwind. Even if you change the field to mountain / volcanic top, 4 of his Pokemon have Heavenly Wing to bring it right back. In fact, all six of his team members sport at least one of Heavenly Wing/Hurricane/Sky Attack, sure to deal heavy damage and tons of OHKOs via an offensive type fielding no immunities. But, what if you can outspeed? Well... good luck killing anything. Since Flying's weaknesses will be neutered by the weather and Normal's one weakness is canceled by flying, Unfezant and Pidgeot cannot be hit with super effective moves under the standard circumstances. The wind will ruin whatever Rock/Ice/Electric strategies you had in mind, plus Big Pecks activations, and Dragonite's Multiscale adding to the team's bulk.

Luckily there are a few solid strategies to consider. As stated before, cloud nine users can temporarily disable immunities, so perhaps Drampa with an Electric move or Golduck with an Ice move can find success. There are also some field changes we can do. Using Smack Down/Gravity twice can bring you to Mountain field, which will at least stop the Big Pecks from activating. Note that Flying moves are still boosted on this field. If you go for Lava Plume or Blizzard from here, you can take it to Volcano and Snowy Mountain, allowing you to win with some strategy involving Fire/Ice moves respectively. That said, his Dragonite can get a Weakness Policy boost and rampage with boosted Thunder in the former and again, flying moves hit hard in the latter. If you really want to go crazy with the field changing strategy, from Mountain, use Dig to bring it to a Cave, which is a good way to neutralize most of his strategy. If you can live enough turns, use Blizzard to freeze the cave for a solid Ice core, or from here use Magma Drift/Lava Plume to get to play on a water's surface, which can be nice for Water and Electric oriented teams.

Another plausible strategy is, well, if you can't beat him, join him! The Sky Field can be beneficial for your team, too! The good news is that the first 8 turns of Tailwind that Souta gets are the *only* turns of Tailwind he can get, meaning equipping just two of your Pokemon with the seed means that you can nullify the effects of his tailwind for the first 8 turns and then outspeed him during a different 8 turns. Honchkrow is an option, as with Moxie, you can boost and with a Tailwind of your own, outspeed some of his team and hit incredibly hard with Sky Attack. Alternatively, although the Strong Wind stops them from being super effective on anything not named Swanna, Electric moves are still very potent on this field due to boosts, and Electric types still resist Flying. Thunder always hits and is boosted, so if you have something fast like Electivire with Thunder, you might find success.

I probably sound like a broken record by now with this one, but  Trick Room is also a great choice.

Win to get *TM62 Acrobatics*! And more importantly, you'll get the Golden Wing Badge.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay? (Erin +2)
- He doesn't matter. (Erin -4)

You'll also get... *Souta's Cane*. Well, that's interesting.

## The Aelita Incident

After a conversation with Erin and Eldest, head into the middle room upstairs. After the scene, exit the building.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's save Aelita! (Melia +3, Erin +3)
- Can't Erin just go? (Erin -3, Melia -3)

As soon as you're ready, talk to Erin and agree to enter the rift. Head up and follow the path, it's quite straightforward. Grab the *Rift Notes on Pulse: Bella* and continue. Erin is gonna help us with this fight:

Dimensional Rift... Aelita?? (Dimensional Rift Field)
-   "Aelita"/Regirock, Level 80. @ Leftovers. Ability: Savagery. Type:
    Rock/Fighting. Stats: 200/190/200/190/200/200.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Earthquake
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Aura Sphere

Every turn you attack Aelita she gets a massive attack/special attack boost. Furthermore, she likes to use powerful doubles moves, meaning every turn she might knock out both yours and Erin's Pokemon. Luckily Erin does help here: for example, her Absol uses super effective Superpower and has a Focus Sash. The key is to slow it down enough that you can overwhelm it with super effective attacks once the 3 shields are broken.

Back inside, head into the left room upstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You sure you're okay? (Melia +1, Erin +1)
- ... (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's save Venam! (Melia +3, Erin +2)
- ... (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Welcome back! (Aelita +4)
- Too speedy... (Erin -2, Aelita -2)

That concludes chapter 12!
