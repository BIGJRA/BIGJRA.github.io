!battle(["Amelia",:SERVANT,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

## Kristiline Town

Talk to the crew. Kreiss will give you the Glacier Badge, raising our level cap to Lv. 55! 

Head outside to start exploring Kristiline Town. 

!enc(329)

To the left:

**ZCell 070: Kristiline Town**

!img("zcell070.png")

Enter the Sapphire Museum. Talk to the old man to begin the *Museum Quest*. Back outside, enter the Kristiline Eatery to the left. Talk to a man here and give him the Aquamarine Ore we found earlier in exchange for a *Prism Scale*!

!shop("Kristiline Eatery", ["Lava Cookie"])

Outside, pluck the *Occa Berry* and enter the TM Shop.

!shop("Kristiline TMs", [["RM02 Avalanche", 20000], ["RM03 Zap Cannon", 30000], ["RM04 Metronome", 10000], ["RM06 Retaliate", 15000], ["RM07 Dynamic Punch", 25000], ["RM08 Vacuum Wave", 20000], ["RM09 Tri Attack", 20000], ["TM140 Ice Fang", 10000], ["TM141 Fire Fang", 10000], ["TM142 Thunder Fang", 10000], ["TM143 Psycho Cut", 25000], ["TM157 Breaking Swipe", 25000]])

To the right, you can exchange Heart Scales with an NPC for a changed Hidden Power type. Activate the Kristiline Noctowl Statue! There is a breeder here, beating them grants *2 Exp. Candy L*. 

!battle(["Zeph",:POKEBREEDER_M,0], "Beach Field")

Enter the Pokemon Center. If you've done all the other virtual badge battles, we can continue that quest.

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,6], "Virtual Trainer (Chikorita)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,16], "Virtual Trainer (Cyndaquil)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,26], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,27], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

Once you win, you'll get the eighth *Virtual Badge* and *25 AP*!

Outside, get *3 Passho Berries*. Enter the help center to get *TM73 Thunder Wave*! Go south across the bridge.

**ZCell 071: Kristiline Town**

!img("zcell071.png")

A *Razor Claw* is below. Grab an Alolan Sandshrew from the PC, then trade it with an NPC to get **Vulpix (Alolan)**! Also here is:

**ZCell 072: Kristiline Town**

!img("zcell072.png")

Go up to reach the Isle of Angels.

!enc(540, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Grab the hidden *Dive Ball*. To the right is a *Shed Shell*. Go onto the water to find a hidden *Magical Seed* and *Ice Heal*. A fisherman here will trade 10 Occa Berries for a *Deepseatooth* or *Deepseascale*. You can grow them in the flower patches if you want these now, or wait till the next chapter to buy them.

Grab the hidden *Max Repel* and *Icicle Plate* above. *TM07 Hail* is to the left.

**ZCell 073: Isle of Angels**

!img("zcell073.png")

Back to the right, across the bridge:

**ZCell 074: Isle of Angels**

!img("zcell074.png")

Reenter the Church of Theolia. In the room at the top:

**ZCell 075: Church of Theolia**

!img("zcell075.png")

Should you want to return to the Tower of Theolia area, you can do so in the room on the left side of the church.

## 7 Badge Sidequests

That's all for Kristiline Town and Isle of Angels exploration for now, but we can take care of a few quests and things right now.

Take Noctowl to Kakori Village. Mr. Luck's Tent now has a new move tutor:

!tutor("Marnie Move Tutor", [["Bug Bite", "3 Green Shards"], ["Bounce", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Drill Run", "3 Yellow Shards"], ["Electroweb", "3 Red Shards"], ["Gastro Acid", "3 Yellow Shards"], ["Focus Energy", "3 Red Shards"], ["Skill Swap", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Signal Beam", "3 Green Shards"], ["Coaching", "3 Red Shards"]])

Take the truck to Goldenleaf. In the house nearest the eastern gate, you'll find the artist for the *Museum Quest*. Next, head back to the outside area of Wispy Tower and enter the Wispy Ruins to the east. Climb down the ivy in the rightmost room, then make your way to the southeast corner of Wispy Chasm. Step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 7: a *Data Drive* and *Odd Keystone*.

Head back out to Goldenleaf Town. Enter Narcissa's Gym and talk to the guy at the front. Make your way all the way back through Backstage Theatre and enter the mirror.

Enter this door at the top, then interact with the painting up here. Follow Mew out of the room, through the mirror to get the *Odd Key*, and to the Lost Castle on the Forgotten Path.

Here, we're going to want to read all the books and keep track of all the numbers. Head up the stairs and talk to Dusclops, and enter the following: 0044, 6677, 3645, 9043, 7171. Enter the next room and get ready for a series of battles. It's a gauntlet of 3: just be prepared for the Shedinja in the last team.

!battle(["Narcissa",:GAUNTLET,0], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Narcissa",:GAUNTLET,1], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Narcissa",:GAUNTLET,2], "Haunted Field")

Burst the bubble at the top! This marks the official beginning of the *Narcissa's Hauntings* quest, though this is all we can do in it for now.

Make your way all the way back to Kristiline Town. Reenter the museum and choose which sculpture you prefer. Completing the *Museum Quest*, you'll get $10,000. There is a *Cherish Ball* in the trash to the right.

The Kristiline Help Center is closed, but we can learn about its requests via the Kakori Village Help Center. There's a quiz event, something involving a princess, and a quest from the Ranger HQ. Only the first one is completable right now.

### Kristiline's Quiz Show!

Enter the house in Kristiline to the east of the Isle of Angels entrance.

Head outside and enter the house in the top right of town. Talk to the guy here to start a quiz, similar to the one in the Tower of Theolia. You have to be quick to answer correctly.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Bug, 95, Aquamarine Chamber, Fever Pitch, Marty, 4, 3, Teila Resort, Mt. Terajuma, Yes.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solutions to the quiz</a>
</div>

You'll get an *Exp. Candy XL*, *Lucky Egg* for winning. After...that... head back to the Kakori Help Center to get $10000. (+1 Karma)

## Corrupted Cave 

Now we will proceed with the story. Talk to Aelita in Kristiline Town. You'll need to choose a third character to join you in the upcoming journey. You can choose Reina, Kreiss, or Adam. Talk to Aelita to go to Sheridan. Inside the Sensei's house, talk to Texen, then head upstairs for a 3v3 battle.

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT,1])

!battle(["Texen",:LEADER_TEXEN,0], "Big Top Arena")

Luckily Aelita's team is pretty useful here, thanks to some type advantages. Once you're back in Carotos Mountain, smash a rock to open a shortcut to the rest of the cave. Enter the Corrupted Cave. Aelita (team above) will join us a partner.

!enc(64)

You'll also find **Grimer (Alolan)** and **Garbodor** walking around in certain parts.

Hidden in the first map is a *Poison Gem*. The next map has two hidden *Super Repels*. Follow the path down and to the left.

!battle(["Deborah",:SERVANT,0], "Corrupted Cave")

Climb down the ladder. Go up and get a hidden *Moon Stone*. In the next room, talk to the pillar and show it a Dragon-type Pokemon. This opens a door to the right, where you can get *TM86 Grass Knot*. Back in the previous room, you'll need to push blocks onto the correct yellow tiles. The correct placements can be noted in the bottom left room. 

Enter the next room. We'll need to move the statues on the left side onto the yellow dots corresponding to the positions on the right side. Head into the next room when you succeed.

!battle(["Tommen",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Deep Earth")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Aelita

 After this scene, follow Aelita into the room to the left, then climb the vines to enter the room to the right. Observe the position of the blocks.

Set the blocks in the left room into this position, then enter the door. Enter the newly revealed room and prepare for a fight.

Ancient Kingdra (Blessed Field)
-   Kingdra, Level 55. @ Dragon Fang.
    -   Origin Pulse
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Luster Purge
    -   Ice Beam / Aura Sphere / Mystical Fire (Random)

Luckily, not too bad. If you beat the one in the ancient forest you can do this one. Lowering its special attack can be key. If one of the randomly generated final moves counters your team you can reset for a different one.

Enter this next room. Across this bridge is the alignment we need to set these blocks into. A solution (thanks Elucidative!):

1. Pangoro left all the way, down all the way, right 2, up 2, right 3, up 3
2. Zorua left all the way, down all the way, right 2, down all the way, right 3, down 3
3. Apple right 4, up 2, right 3
4. Chimecho right all the way (it'll be stopped by the Zorua), up all the way, right all the way, up 2, left all the way
5. Zorua left 1
6. Budew left all the way (it'll be stopped by the Zorua), up 3, right all the way
7. Zorua right 1, up 3

Head east and battle Esther, then take out another Kingdra. Enter the door to the right. Head down the stairs, then out the bottom. Follow the path to get *TM86 Grass Knot*.

Head down the stairs to the west for an optional challenge.

1. Pink Shellos left, down all the way, left all the way, down 5, left, down all the way, right, down all the way
2. Starly up 1, right all the way, down 1, right 2, down 6, left, down all the way, left (it'll be stopped by the Apple), down all the way, left 1
3. Apple right 1, up, right 1, up 7, right, up 7, left all the way, down
5, right 1
4. Omanyte right 1, up 3, right, up 7, left 3, up 1
5. Lopunny up, right, up all the way, left, up 3, left 7, up all the way, right 1, up 7, right, up 7, right 4, up, right, up
6. Shinx left 2, up all the way, right, up all the way, left, up 3, left
9, up 5, right 1
7. Pink Shellos right 5, down all the way, right, down all the way, left, down 3, right all the way, up 2
8. Blue Shellos up 1, left all the way, down all the way, right, down all the way, right 5, down all the way, right, down all the way, left, down
3, left all the way, up 2
9. Starly right 10, up 2, right all the way, up, right 2, up all the way, right all the way, up 1
10. Darkrai up, left 2, up 5, left 1
11. Slugma left all the way, up, left all the way, down, right 1, down 5, left all the way (it'll be stopped by Darkrai), down 5, left 3, up
12. Darkrai right 6, up all the way, right all the way, down all the way

Up from here in the newly opened area, you can touch a statue to fight **Zorua**!

Then, head back up and take note of each of statue placement - we're going to need to move each into that spot upstairs yet again. The solution:

1. Omanyte right all the way, down all the way, left 1, down 4, right 7, up 3
2. Zorua down 1, right 2
3. Pangoro down 8, left 4, up
4. Starly right 2, down 2
5. Zorua left 1, down 1, right 1, down all the way (it'll be stopped by Aelita), left 7, up all the way
6. Starly right 1, up, right all the way, up all the way, left 2, up 8, right all the way, down 2
7. Chingling up, left 3, up 8, left all the way, down, left 2
8. Darkrai right all the way, up all the way, left 2, up 8, left 1
9. Apple down 1, left all the way (it'll be stopped by Darkrai), down all the way
10. Darkrai right

Enter the newly opened area at the top.

There are encounters here in the water.

Garufa Ruins

| Old Rod   | %    | Good Rod     |  %       | Water        | %   |

Deborah will mock you here but tell her "from the start" to progress.

We'll end up back in Sheridan. Head into the village proper and talk to Aelita to progress.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- But why? (Aelita +1)
- A good decision. (Aelita -2)

Accept the fast travel, step on the pad, and enter the left room. Exit the room and surf across to the right and go all the way down the vines and out. Itemfinder around here to get a Moon Stone! Step on the pad, then go up. Head up to the battlefield.

Chamber of Awakening

| Cave        | %        |

| Salandit    | 31       |
| Slugma      | 30       |

Angie's Right Hand Man Cera (Corrupted Cave)
-   Groudon, Level 57. @ Lum Berry.
    -   Precipice Blades
    -   Rest
    -   Lava Plume
    -   Solarbeam

Luckily, because of the field, Groudon will get Poisoned. If you can deal just enough damage for it to get knocked out here, you'll be fine.

You'll then get the *Magma Stone but* be presented with a choice. It is up to you what to choose: the story will split here a bit. Choosing "Keep It" grants (+1 Karma). Jump to the section corresponding to your choice.

## Valor Mountain

### Entering the Mountain (Kept It Route)

Head back to the room Aelita was in, then follow Tommen out. After a brief cutscene, you'll be back in Sheridan.

Make your way to unfreeze the T.M. shop in Kristiline. You'll be given *TM110 Magma Drift*!

Head back into the shop, and they'll have wares:

Kristiline T.M. Shop (\<12 Badges)

|Item                |Price |
|--------------------|------|
|*RM02 Avalanche*    |$50000|
|*RM03 Zap Cannon*   |$50000|
|*RM04 Metronome*    |$25000|
|*RM06 Retaliate*    |$25000|
|*RM07 Dynamic Punch*|$50000|
|*RM08 Vacuum Wave*  |$25000|
|*RM09 Tri Attack*   |$25000|
|*TM141 Fire Fang*   |$20000|
|*TM142 Thunder Fang*|$20000|
|*TM143 Psycho Cut*  |$70000|

Buy these if you'd like!

Return to Teila Resort, and enter Tesla's Villa. Head upstairs and talk to Valarie and Venam.

Head to Valor Shore, and drift across the lava and enter. Get the *Emotion Powder* as you walk in.

Head to the upper left and go up the ladder. Beat the Xen scientist here and activate the Fire Source Crystal! Then, take the ladder here at the bottom. Activate the Ice Crystal here.

Head down the left ladder from the entrance, and notice that the Chamber of Awakening at the top is now open.

We get to choose whether or not we are going to save Amber. You don't have to, but if you choose not to, characters will hate you and you will not get the karma. If you choose to do so, read the saving Amber section below. If not, skip ahead to the convergence section.

### Saving Amber (Kept It Route)

Enter the chamber, and head up and stand in the circle for another titanic battle!

Kyogre (Water Surface Field)
-   Kyogre, Level 60.
    -   Muddy Water
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Ice Beam

This is a bit harder than Groudon since the field really helps it, rather than hurts it. Long story short, its Muddy Water boosted by rain and water surface will decimate your entire team. And it has 3 shields. If you have anything with Thunder, it hits 100% of the time and may be the best tool you have to take it out. I managed to win this thing on my Fire Monotype, so I'm sure you will eventually find a way.

After winning, Madelis will give you the *HQ Railnet Key*.

### Entering the Mountain (Gave It Away Route)

Head back to the room Aelita was in, then follow Tommen out. After a brief cutscene, you'll be back in Sheridan.

Return to Teila Resort, and enter Tesla's Villa. Head upstairs and talk to Valarie and Venam. Accept the fast travel. Head all the way up. After a conversation, enter the door.

Talk to Venam up from here. Then, head up the ladder to 1F and head right. You'll get the *Emotion Powder*.

Head to the upper left and go up the ladder. Beat the Xen scientist here and activate the Fire Source Crystal! Then, take the ladder here at the bottom. Activate the Ice Crystal here.

Head down the left ladder from the entrance, and you'll notice the Chamber of Awakening is now open. and enter the Chamber of Awakening at the top that is now open. Talk with Venam here then head up.

We get to choose whether or not we are going to save Amber. You don't have to, but if you choose not to, characters will hate you and you will not get the karma. If you choose to do so, read the saving Amber section below. If not, skip ahead to the convergence section.

### Saving Amber (Gave It Away Route)

Enter the chamber and talk to Venam. Then head up from here and stand in the circle for another titanic battle!

Kyogre (Water Surface Field)
-   Kyogre, Level 60.
    -   Muddy Water
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Ice Beam

Luckily in this route, Venam helps us defeat Kyogre. The field really helps it, rather than hurts it. Long story short, its Muddy Water boosted by rain and water surface will decimate your entire team. And it has 3 shields. If you have anything with Thunder, it hits 100% of the time and may be the best tool you have to take it out. I managed to win this thing on my Fire Monotype, so I'm sure you will eventually find a way.

After winning, Madelis will give you the *HQ Railnet Key*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Don't wait till it's too late. (Venam +2)
- Be kind to her. (venam +1)
- ... (Venam -2)

### Scaling Mt. Valor (Both Routes Converge)

So now the routes essentially converge, so I will cover all the Pokemon and items we can get in the mountain as we scale it. Even if you choose not to fight Kyogre and save Amber, there is a Zygarde cell you can get by entering the Chamber of Awakening.

ZCell 043: Chamber of Awakening

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image44.png"/>

Return to the first floor. Each mood of the mountain has different encounters we can fight.

Icy Valor Mountain

| Cave                       | %        |
|----------------------------|----------|
| **Sandygast (Aevian Ice)** | 20       |
| **Sandslash (Alolan)**     | 20       |
| **Cryogonal**              | 15       |
| Delibird                   | 14       |
| **Beartic**                | 10       |
| Abomasnow                  | 10       |
| **Piloswine**              | 5        |
| **Drampa**                 | 5        |
| Bergmite                   | 1        |

While the cave is Icy, pick up the *Revive* at the bottom left, as well as the *Ice Heal* and hidden *Water Stone* in the bottom right of the snow. *TM132 Icicle Spear* is at the top right of this area as well.

Head up at the top of this area and enter the base. Go upstairs, grab *Blunder Policy* and *Metal Powder*, and push the switch in the top right corner. Pressing the switch next to Reina grants (+3 Reina Relationship Points). Back downstairs, try to leave through the top and you'll get teased again. Try to leave through the bottom.

After... something... Saki gives you a *Revive* if you kept the Magma Stone, but if not, you'll finally get the T.M. for Magma Drift!

Head up through the newly destroyed door. Go up and activate the Neutral Source Crystal!

Normal Valor Mountain

| Cave                        | %   | Water   | %  |

| Dugtrio                     | 5   |         |    |
| Claydol                     | 5   |         |    |
| **Druddigon**               | 5   |         |    |

|Old Rod  | %    | Good Rod        | %        |
|---------|------|-----------------|----------|
|Seel     | 100  | **Clauncher**   | 60       |
|         |      | Sealeo          | 20       |
|         |      | Staryu          | 20       |

Head back down from here, and you'll find:

ZCell 044: Valor Mountain (Normal)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image45.png"/>

You can also get **Heracross** if you go down and through the barricade.

Head all the way up from here, pick up the *Hyper Potion*, and go up the ladder. Loop your way around to the left. Grab *TM147 Tail Slap* hiding behind the Ice Source Crystal, then activate it. To the left, you'll find:

ZCell 045: Valor Mountain (Ice)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image46.png"/>

Make your way around and up. Activate the fire crystal at the top here.

Fiery Valor Mountain (Burning Cave Field)

| Cave                        | %        |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Slugma                      | 20       |
| **Sandygast (Aevian Fire)** | 20       |
| **Camerupt**                | 20       |

| **Turtonator**              | 5        |

Head down and right, then drift across to find **Vulpix**! Give it a GourmetTreat for a battle.

By clicking each crystal in succession, make your way to the top of the room. Back at the top of the room, fall down the hole to the left. You'll find:

ZCell 046: Valor Mountain (Ice)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image47.png"/>

Fall down the hole again, then proceed all the way through the barricade and back up the mountain. This time, take the ladder at the top.

Exit to the Valor Cliffside. Pick up hidden *HP Up* and *Blast Powder*. On the Gave It Away Route, if you ignored saving Amber, now you will get
(-2 Venam Relationship Points).

Time for another fight with Eli and Sharon. This is a 12v6 with the help of Venam, so it really shouldn't be that much of a problem. Make sure Gyarados doesn't set up!

ZCell 047: Valor Cliffside

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image48.png"/>

Head down from here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're cruel. (Venam +3)
- ... (Neutral)
- She deserved it. (Venam -4)

Head up and into the next room. Grab *TM134 Rock Blast*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We can do this together! (Melia +3, Venam +3)
- Sorta like that, yeah. (Melia +1, Venam +1)
- Team Xen is all I care about. (Melia -2, Venam -2)

Activate the fire crystal here, then return to the main dungeon through the cliffside. On the right side, you'll find:

ZCell 048: Valor Mountain (Fire)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image49.png"/>

Head down and go to the left. Drift across then jump in the hole twice.

ZCell 049: Valor Mountain (Fire)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image50.png"/>

Also, talk to Heatmor with a GourmetTreat for a chance to catch it.

Next, head up at the top of this room to reenter the blockade. Upstairs the rightmost door will be open now, head outside and feed **Tepig** a bunch of GourmetTreats for a chance to battle it.

Head back to the cliffside and enter the room beyond. Interact with the neutral crystal, then head back into the dungeon via the cliffside once more. On the left, surf and fall down the hole. Pick up a hidden *Rare Candy*, then fall down the other hole and grab the *Leaf Stone* at the bottom!

Jump down the ledge, and head up the ladder here. On the right:

ZCell 050: Valor Mountain (Normal)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image51.png"/>

Head back down the ladder, activate the ice crystal, then enter the teleporter at the bottom of this map.

Head all the way back up to the top and enter the summit.

## Valor Summit

Grab the *Dragon Scale* on the left of the summit.

Head up to the top when you're ready. The first battle:

Renegade Giratina (Volcano Top Field)
-   Giratina, Level 60. @ Griseous Orb.
    -   Shadow Force
    -   Earth Power
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Magma Drift

If you have Blizzard it can help a ton with this fight. Volcanic Top -\>
Mountain -\> Snowy Mountain across two blizzards, but back to Volcanic Top after it uses Magma Drift. You can also consider paralyzing and poisoning it if necessary. Ultimately this isn't that bad of a fight if you have a decent strategy.

Heal, and follow the action to the top. Time for a double battle with Melia.

Team Xen Geara and Zetta (Volcano Top Field)
-   Krookodile, Level 53. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Earthquake
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Crunch
    -   Low Kick
-   Grimmsnarl, Level 53. @ Light Clay.
    -   False Surrender
    -   Spirit Break
    -   Reflect
    -   Light Screen
-   Gyarados, Level 54. @ Assault Vest.
    -   Iron Head
    -   Waterfall
    -   Earthquake
    -   Stone Edge
-   Clefable, Level 55. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Thunder
    -   Moonblast
    -   Flamethrower
-   Marowak (Alolan), Level 53. @ Thick Club.
    -   Bonemerang
    -   Shadow Bone
    -   Low Kick
    -   Fire Punch
-   Gengar, Level 55. @ Life Orb.
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Will-O-Wisp
    -   Focus Blast
-   Minior, Level 53. @ Telluric Seed.
    -   Shell Smash
    -   Acrobatics
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Earthquake
-   Weavile, Level 53. @ Razor Claw.
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Brick Break
    -   Night Slash
    -   Fake Out
-   Absol, Level 53. @ Scope Lens.
    -   Stone Edge
    -   Sucker Punch
    -   Night Slash
    -   Brick Break
-   Typhlosion, Level 55. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Eruption
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Focus Blast
    -   Hidden Power Grass
-   Dragonite, Level 54. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Brick Break
    -   Dragon Claw
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Thunder Punch
-   Silvally, Level 55. @ Ground Memory.
    -   Multi-Attack
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Thunder

This battle is insane, but at least a fitting final Xen boss to Act 1 of Pokemon Rejuvenation! Zetta's Typhlosion is intense, as it's fast and its Eruption is strong. Grimmsnarl also gets basically at least 1 free screen unless you have Brick Break to remove it, so that is also tough to deal with. Their aces, Gengar and Silvally respectively, are also insanely fast and can kill most of your Pokemon. Worst of all about half of Melia's team kind of sucks and isn't really that helpful in this fight!

The Volcano Top field can be used to your advantage: consider using your own Fire moves to take advantage of it. You can also transition to Sky Field with Bounce or to Volcanic Field with Dig, both of which you may be able to get a better footing in. Regardless of the field effect, the key is making sure that you have the right pairings at any given time, so Melia's Pokemon don't get one-shotted. Unfortunately, this means a LOT of trial and error with the AI, but eventually you'll be able to find the exact chinks in Zetta and Geara's armor and can take them out.

In the beach area, follow the path.

Afterwards, return to the top of the mountain, collecting the souls as you go. You'll be thrust into a battle with Geara and Zetta again, but all their Pokemon are at 1HP and you are supposed to easily win.

Make your way to the bridge in Terajuma Jungle and approach Melia.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes. (Melia +2)
- No. (Neutral)

Talk to Crescent.

Now, the next destination is the gym battle. If you want to progress, skip the next section.

## Post-Valor Quests

We can pick up a few Pokemon and items! Head to Ranger HQ in Kakori. Talk to Crawli at the entrance for ZCrystal *Buginium-Z*. We can't use it yet, though.

First, if you didn't save Amber, enter the Chamber of Awakening in Valor mountain, where you'll find the *HQ Railnet Key*.

Next, if you went down the Gave It Away Route, the T.M. Store in Kristiline is now open. The list of T.M.'s they sell is in the top of the previous section.

The people of Akuwa Town have... FINALLY been returned to their home, so head to Akuwa Town.

2.  Talk to Mudkip on the southern middle island

    train to the hidden lab.

    Batteries, and Poke Ball to obtain **Ralts**!
6.  Exit out the door at the bottom, then head down to Mudkip. While
    you're here, pick up a *Damp Rock* and a *Fighting Memory*, and a
    hidden *Star Piece* to the south.
7.  Surf up from here, and enter Xen Lab from its left side. The door is
    sorta hard to see. Then exit to the south. Surf across and to the
    right, and you can battle/catch **Mudkip**!

We also now have Magma Drift, so there are a few places we can go. Buy a Spice Powder from the jungle if you don't have one yet, and head to Sheridan, enter Carotos. Rock Smash the rock to the left and drift to the left. Grab *TM36 Sludge Bomb*! Head back to the right and drift across here. Clear this maze and grab the *Rare Candy* as well as the **Cyndaquil** egg.

Enter the next room and make your way to Madelis' palace. Head down to the corrupted cave area. Magma Drift here and follow the path to a *Poison Barb*. Back on land, continue following the path to the southeast and you'll find another spot to Magma Drift on the right. Hidden along it is another *Poison Barb*. Follow the path to catch **Aevian Paras**!

This is all we can do for now, so when you're ready, head back to Teila Resort and enter the dance hall.

Talk to Reina in here to get a *Dusk Stone* and *Exp. Candy M*. You can also battle her. Talk to the girl at the top. She'll tell us about building hype. Do whatever you have to do to build the hype - talk to people, battle trainers, change the song with the guy on the right.

After building some hype, an Audino trainer will appear. She uses level 55's, so you should be able to grind your team up if need be. You'll get 7 *Exp. Candy M* when you win.

Once you've hyped to the max, head into the battlefield.

Music Enthusiast Amber (Volcano Top Field)
-   Camerupt, Level 53. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Fever Pitch
    -   Hidden Power Electric
    -   Earthquake
    -   Lava Plume
-   Arcanine, Level 54. @ Assault Vest.
    -   Bulldoze
    -   Magma Drift
    -   Wild Charge
    -   Close Combat
-   Flareon, Level 54. @ Telluric Seed.
    -   Magma Drift
    -   Toxic
    -   Rest
    -   Fever Pitch
-   Blaziken, Level 53. @ Air Balloon.
    -   Fever Pitch
    -   Hi Jump Kick
    -   Thunder Punch
    -   Protect
-   Chandelure, Level 53. @ Air Balloon.
    -   Magma Drift
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Energy Ball
    -   Flame Charge
-   Aevian Toxtricity, Level 55. @ Throat Spray.
    -   Hidden Power Grass
    -   Thunder
    -   Boomburst
    -   Fever Pitch

Fever Pitch: Fire \| Special \| 70, 100, or 130 power depending on Hype level \| 100% accuracy \| Can be used even when asleep, and wakes up all sleeping Pokemon on the field \| On Volcanic Top Field, power is boosted x1.2 and triggers an eruption \| Two uses transforms Cave Field into Volcanic Field.

Relationship Points are granted based on the conditions under which you end this battle:
-   End the battle on Snowy Mountain field (-2 Amber)
-   End the battle with \<300 Hype (-4 Amber)
-   End the battle with \>= 300 Hype (+3 Amber)

Anyways, this battle isn't super tough, but it can still be tricky. Her Toxtricity can hit hard once it boosts its Sp. Atk. with Throat Spray, and Chandelure hits hard as always. Speed Boost Blaziken can also be threatening. As Jan says, if you can change the field, you'll be golden. Mountain Field, Icy Mountain, Water Surface, Underwater can all be useful fields you can use against her in a chain. You can also turn it to Sky Field with a single use of Bounce! Even if you don't, a good Earthquake user or two with something to take out the Air Balloons can do a number on her team.

Win to get the Lyric Badge, which lets us hit Level 60, and *TM50 Overheat*! Head outside and watch the cutscene.
