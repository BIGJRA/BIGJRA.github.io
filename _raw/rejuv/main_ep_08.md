# Chapter 8: Those We Lose

You'll find yourself playing as Aelita!

!newself(["Aelita",:STUDENT,4])

!battle(["Amelia",:SERVANT,0], "Frozen Dimensional Field")

## Kristiline Town

Talk to the crew. Kreiss will give you the Glacier Badge, raising our level cap to Lv. 55! 

Head outside to start exploring Kristiline Town. 

!enc(329)

To the left:

**ZCell 070: Kristiline Town**

!img("zcell070.png")

Enter the Sapphire Museum. Talk to the old man to begin the *Museum Quest*. Back outside, enter the Kristiline Eatery to the left. Talk to a man here and give him the Aquamarine Ore we found earlier in exchange for a *Prism Scale*!

!shop("Kristiline Eatery", ["Lava Cookie"])

Outside, pluck the *Occa Berry* and enter the TM Shop.

!shop("Kristiline TMs", [["RM02 Avalanche", 20000], ["RM03 Zap Cannon", 30000], ["RM04 Metronome", 10000], ["RM06 Retaliate", 15000], ["RM07 Dynamic Punch", 25000], ["RM08 Vacuum Wave", 20000], ["RM09 Tri Attack", 20000], ["TM140 Ice Fang", 10000], ["TM141 Fire Fang", 10000], ["TM142 Thunder Fang", 10000], ["TM143 Psycho Cut", 25000], ["TM157 Breaking Swipe", 25000]])

To the right, you can exchange Heart Scales with an NPC for a changed Hidden Power type. Activate the Kristiline Noctowl Statue! There is a breeder here, beating them grants *2 Exp. Candy L*. 

!battle(["Zeph",:POKEBREEDER_M,0], "Beach Field")

Enter the Pokemon Center. If you've done all the other virtual badge battles, we can continue that quest.

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,6], "Virtual Trainer (Chikorita)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,16], "Virtual Trainer (Cyndaquil)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,26], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

!battle(["Pryce",:JOHTO_7,0], "Glitch Field")

Get a *Virtual Badge* for winning. Talk to her again to take on Clair.

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,7], "Virtual Trainer (Chikorita)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,17], "Virtual Trainer (Cyndaquil)")

!newself(["Ethan",:JOHTO_0M,27], "Virtual Trainer (Totodile)")

!battle(["Clair",:JOHTO_8,0], "Glitch Field")

Once you win, you'll get the eighth *Virtual Badge* and *25 AP*!

Outside, get *3 Passho Berries*. Enter the help center to get *TM73 Thunder Wave*! Go south across the bridge.

**ZCell 071: Kristiline Town**

!img("zcell071.png")

A *Razor Claw* is below. Grab an Alolan Sandshrew from the PC, then trade it with an NPC to get **Vulpix (Alolan)**! Also here is:

**ZCell 072: Kristiline Town**

!img("zcell072.png")

Go up to reach the Isle of Angels.

!enc(540, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

At night, you can catch the "legendary" **Phione** here by giving it a *GourmetTreat*.

Grab the hidden *Dive Ball*. To the right is a *Shed Shell*. Go onto the water to find a hidden *Magical Seed* and *Ice Heal*. A fisherman here will trade 10 Occa Berries for a *Deepseatooth* or *Deepseascale*. You can grow them in the flower patches if you want these now, or wait till the next chapter to buy them.

Grab the hidden *Max Repel* and *Icicle Plate* above. *TM07 Hail* is to the left.

**ZCell 073: Isle of Angels**

!img("zcell073.png")

Back to the right, across the bridge:

**ZCell 074: Isle of Angels**

!img("zcell074.png")

Reenter the Church of Theolia. In the room at the top:

**ZCell 075: Church of Theolia**

!img("zcell075.png")

Should you want to return to the Tower of Theolia area, you can do so in the room on the left side of the church.

## 7 Badge Sidequests

That's all for Kristiline Town and Isle of Angels exploration for now, but we can take care of a few quests and things right now.

Take Noctowl to Kakori Village. Mr. Luck's Tent now has a new move tutor:

!tutor("Marnie Move Tutor", [["Bug Bite", "3 Green Shards"], ["Bounce", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Drill Run", "3 Yellow Shards"], ["Electroweb", "3 Red Shards"], ["Gastro Acid", "3 Yellow Shards"], ["Focus Energy", "3 Red Shards"], ["Skill Swap", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Signal Beam", "3 Green Shards"], ["Coaching", "3 Red Shards"]])

Take the truck to Goldenleaf. In the house nearest the eastern gate, you'll find the artist for the *Museum Quest*. Next, head back to the outside area of Wispy Tower and enter the Wispy Ruins to the east. Climb down the ivy in the rightmost room, then make your way to the southeast corner of Wispy Chasm. Step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 7: a *Data Drive* and *Odd Keystone*.

Head back out to Goldenleaf Town. Enter Narcissa's Gym and talk to the guy at the front. Make your way all the way back through Backstage Theatre and enter the mirror.

Enter this door at the top, then interact with the painting up here. Follow Mew out of the room, through the mirror to get the *Odd Key*, and to the Lost Castle on the Forgotten Path.

Here, we're going to want to read all the books and keep track of all the numbers. Head up the stairs and talk to Dusclops, and enter the following: 0044, 6677, 3645, 9043, 7171. Enter the next room and get ready for a series of battles. It's a gauntlet of 3: just be prepared for the Shedinja in the last team.

!battle(["Narcissa",:GAUNTLET,0], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Narcissa",:GAUNTLET,1], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Narcissa",:GAUNTLET,2], "Haunted Field")

Burst the bubble at the top! This marks the official beginning of the *Narcissa's Hauntings* quest, though this is all we can do in it for now.

Make your way all the way back to Kristiline Town. Reenter the museum and choose which sculpture you prefer. Completing the *Museum Quest*, you'll get $10,000. There is a *Cherish Ball* in the trash to the right.

The Kristiline Help Center is closed, but we can learn about its requests via the Kakori Village Help Center. There's a quiz event, something involving a princess, and a quest from the Ranger HQ. Only the first one is completable right now.

### Kristiline's Quiz Show!

Enter the house in Kristiline to the east of the Isle of Angels entrance.

Head outside and enter the house in the top right of town. Talk to the guy here to start a quiz, similar to the one in the Tower of Theolia. You have to be quick to answer correctly.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Bug, 95, Aquamarine Chamber, Fever Pitch, Marty, 4, 3, Teila Resort, Mt. Terajuma, Yes.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solutions to the quiz</a>
</div>

You'll get an *Exp. Candy XL*, *Lucky Egg* for winning. After...that... head back to the Kakori Help Center to get $10000. (+1 Karma)

## Corrupted Cave 

Now we will proceed with the story. Talk to Aelita in Kristiline Town. You'll need to choose a third character to join you in the upcoming journey. You can choose Reina, Kreiss, or Adam. Talk to Aelita to go to Sheridan. Inside the Sensei's house, talk to Texen, then head upstairs for a 3v3 battle.

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT,1])

!battle(["Texen",:LEADER_TEXEN,0], "Big Top Arena")

Luckily Aelita's team is pretty useful here, thanks to some type advantages. Once you're back in Carotos Mountain, smash a rock to open a shortcut to the rest of the cave. Enter the Corrupted Cave. Aelita (team above) will join us a partner.

!enc(64)

You'll also find **Grimer (Alolan)** and **Garbodor** walking around in certain parts.

Hidden in the first map is a *Poison Gem*. The next map has two hidden *Super Repels*. Follow the path down and to the left.

!battle(["Deborah",:SERVANT,0], "Corrupted Cave")

Climb down the ladder. Go up and get a hidden *Moon Stone*. In the next room, talk to the pillar and show it a Dragon-type Pokemon. This opens a door to the right, where you can get *TM86 Grass Knot*. Back in the previous room, you'll need to push blocks onto the correct yellow tiles. The correct placements can be noted in the bottom left room. 

Enter the next room. We'll need to move the statues on the left side onto the yellow dots corresponding to the positions on the right side. Head into the next room when you succeed.

!battle(["Tommen",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Deep Earth")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- She can do this! (+3 Aelita)
- I agree with the Eldest (-3 Aelita)

Go down the ladder on the left for a huge, optional puzzle. Make note of all the statue positions down the ladder, then get to work putting them all into the right places. This is arduous and pushing one block into a corner means you have to reset the whole thing, so save often. Once you succeed, go into the door at the top to get **Zorua (Hisuian)** and the *Zoroark Crest*!

Climb back up the ladder, and head into the room at the bottom right. Go to the bottom and show your Dragon-type to another beacon. Follow the path here to return to Eldest. Head in this door and follow the path.

!boss("BOSSGROUDON", "Deep Earth")

Groudon has the power on both fields to rack up a lot of one-shots, so you have to find a way to get around that. Grass type moves are the best offensive option against it, though Fire moves are aplenty. Paralysis and Burn are very helpful, too.

You'll get the *Earth Heart*, though you'll have to make a decision to save the Eldest or refuse to give in. You'll get the *Tower Cellar Key*!

Use the warp and return to Aelita. Chase Tommen out of the Garufan area.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's the best for Aelita (+3 Kreiss, if Kreiss is partner)
- It's better down here (-3 Kreiss, if Kreiss is partner)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We won't leave you (+3 Adam & Braixen / Reina, depending on partner)
- Maybe we should (-3 Adam & Braixen / Reina, depending on partner)

Agree to return to the Tower Cellar with your partner. Inside, you'll get the Ocean Relic!

Take a Noctowl over to Jynnobi Pass and enter the temple on the right side.

!battle(["Crawli",:LEADER_CRAWLI,3], "Swamp Field")

This isn't that much fundamentally different than the previous gym fight, though he now has a Defiant Falinks that tries to sweep and a Crested Ariados! Beat him once more to get *TM110 Magma Drift*! Head up to Route 6.

## Route 6

!enc(300, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Surf to the left.

!battle(["Vinessa",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Water Surface")

Land on the platform to the left.

!dbattle(["Danni",:XENGRUNT_M,2], ["Layla",:XENGRUNT_F,2], "Beach Field")

!battle(["Sheila",:XENGRUNT_F,3], "Beach Field")

!battle(["Malik",:XENGRUNT_M,1], "Beach Field")

Pick up the *Full Heal* to the right and enter the ship through the bottom entrance. Go up. 

!battle(["Lexy",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

In the chests are *2 HP Ups*, *TM137 Power Swap*, *PP Up*, *TM138 Guard Swap*, and *Hasty Mint*. Enter the other room on this level.

!battle(["Marvy",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Pick up the *Black Prism*. Head back outside the ship and enter on the top level.

!battle(["Sayali",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

!battle(["Nickoli",:XENGRUNT_M,1], "Short-Circuit Field")

Exit at the top, and go right for the *Prince from the Sands* quest. If you didn't defeat Madame X, you'll have to fight:

!battle(["Harrington",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Beach Field")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Personal grudge? (+2 Ryland)
- But why? (Neutral)

You will then get an *Ability Capsule* and *Exp. Candy XL*.

*Special Scene: Ryland's Conviction* requires 2 Relationship Points with Ryland at this point.

Backtrack to the water of Route 6, and go up and right.

!battle(["Justy",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Water Surface")

There is a hidden *Star Piece* above. Go under the bridge and up.

!battle(["Reid",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Water Surface")

Land on this platform to raid another boat.

!dbattle(["Troye",:XENGRUNT_F,0], ["Helen",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Beach Field")

Pick up *Blast Powder* then enter the ship. Go up.

!battle(["Mephisto",:XENANALYST_F,100], "Short-Circuit Field")

Catch **Shadow Drifblim**. Press a button above to switch the center tile to the left, then grab the *Rare Candy*. Use the warp and go around to the right for another fight.

!battle(["Zena",:XENANALYST_M,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Catch **Shadow Purugly**. Press the button and go down the ladder. In these chests are *Protein*, *Carbos*, *Iron*, *Calcium*, *HP Up*, *Zinc*, and *TM139 Speed Swap*.

Back outside, use the stabilizer on the whirlpool to fight **Qwilfish (Hisuian)**! Pick up a *Soft Sand* and *Black Prism* beyond. Surf left and land on Clobbo Peak Island. Pick up the *Exp. Candy L* and catch **Chansey**! Up from here, on the island with the Xen member, you'll find Poliwag #6 for the *Poliwag Quest*!

The final Xen ship on the left side of the map is filled with trainers with Pokemon in the Lv. 70+ range. You can fight them if you wish, but I will have us return later when it is more "safe" to do so.

With all that taken care of, land on the Valor Shore at the top and activate the Noctowl Statue. Talk to Neved above, then smash a rock to the right and get *TM124 Scary Face*. Enter the mountain...

## Valor Mountain

Get the *Emotion Powder* as you walk in. You'll be given the quest *Save Amber*, which is technically optional.

!enc(139, nil, ["Old", "Good"], "Valor Mountain (Neutral)")

Surf to the top to get a hidden *Max Repel*. Head to the upper left and go up the ladder. Go forward.

!battle(["Damen",:XENANALYST_M,0], "Cave Field")

Activate the Fire Source Crystal! Then, take the ladder here at the bottom to return to 1F.

Activate the Ice Crystal here.

!enc(146, nil, nil, "Valor Mountain (Cool)")

On this map, to the right is a hidden *Water Stone* and an *Ice Heal*. Head to the top of the area - on the right is *TM132 Icicle Spear*. In the middle is a grunt. 

!battle(["Awul",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Icy Field")

In the bottom left corner, you can get a *Revive*. 

### Saving Amber (Optional)

We don't have to save Amber, but in this section we will. Head down the left ladder from the entrance. Talk to Venam and enter the Chamber of Awakening. On the left, use your new Blast Powder to reach:

**ZCell 076: Chamber of Awakening**

!img("zcell076.png")

Stand in the circle for another titanic battle!

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,3])

!boss("BOSSKYOGRE", "Water Surface")

Thankfully, Venam absolutely pulls her weight on this fight with powerful Grass and Electric type moves plus some resistances to Kyogre's strategies. The stat drops and Whirlpools make trying to sweep with a single mon difficult, so you will likely need a full bench ready to come in. Paralysis and the Storm Drain ability in particular make this battle much easier than it would be otherwise.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Save Amber in Valor Mountain (+1 Amber, +1 Venam, +1 Tesla)

After winning, Madelis will give you the *V.G.C.R. Key*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Don't wait till it's too late. (+2 Venam)
- Be kind to her. (+1 Venam)
- ... (-2 Venam)

### Scaling the Mountain

Return to the first floor. To the right, activate the Fire Crystal.

!enc(140, nil, nil, "Valor Mountain (Warm)")

!battle(["Cruz",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Volcanic Field")

Go to the top of this room.

!battle(["Alias",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Volcanic Field")

!battle(["Aldente",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Volcanic Field")

Head up at the top of this area and enter the base. Go upstairs, grab *Blunder Policy* and *Metal Powder*, and push the switch in the top right corner.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Free Reina in Valor (+3 Reina)

Back downstairs, try to leave through the top and you'll get teased again. Try to leave through the bottom. After... something... head up. Go up and activate the Neutral Source Crystal!

Head back down from here, and you'll find:

**ZCell 077: Valor Mountain (Neutral)**

!img("zcell077.png")

You can also get **Heracross** if you go down and through the barricade.

Head all the way up from here.

!battle(["Tin",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Cave Field")

Pick up the *Hyper Potion* and go up the ladder. Loop your way around to the left.

!battle(["Tobias",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Cave Field")

!battle(["Jensen",:TECH,0], "Cave Field")

Grab *TM147 Tail Slap* hiding behind the Ice Source Crystal, then activate it. To the left, you'll find:

**ZCell 078: Valor Mountain (Cool)**

!img("zcell078.png")

Make your way around and up.

!battle(["Nagi",:XENGRUNT_M,0], "Icy Field")

Activate the fire crystal at the top here.

!battle(["Jiarelen",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Volcanic Field")

Head down and right, then drift across to find **Vulpix**! Give it a GourmetTreat for a battle.

By clicking each crystal in succession, make your way to the top of the room. Back at the top of the room, fall down the hole to the left. You'll find:

**ZCell 079: Valor Mountain (Cool)**

!img("zcell079.png")

Fall down the hole again, then proceed all the way through the barricade and back up the mountain. This time, take the ladder at the top. Exit to the Valor Cliffside.

### Valor Cliffside

Pick up hidden *HP Up* and *Blast Powder*. Head left to fight:

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,3])

!battle(["Eli and Sharon",:MISFORTUNATEDUO,10], "Mountain Field")

Time for another fight with Eli and Sharon. This is a 12v6 with the help of Venam, so it really shouldn't be that much of a problem. Make sure Gyarados doesn't set up!

**ZCell 080: Valor Cliffside**

!img("zcell080.png")

Head down from here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're cruel. (Venam +3)
- ... (Neutral)
- She deserved it. (Venam -4)

Head up and into the next room. Grab *TM134 Rock Blast*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We can do this together! (Melia +3, Venam +3)
- Sorta like that, yeah. (Melia +1, Venam +1)
- Team Xen is all I care about. (Melia -2, Venam -2)

### Exploration Goodies

Activate the fire crystal here, then return to the main dungeon through the cliffside. On the right side, you'll find:

**ZCell 081: Valor Mountain (Warm)**

!img("zcell081.png")

Head down and go to the left. Drift across then jump in the hole twice. Talk to **Growlithe (Hisuian)** and give it a GourmetTreat for a battle. Plus:

**ZCell 082: Valor Mountain (Warm)**

!img("zcell082.png")

Next, head up at the top of this room to reenter the blockade. Upstairs the rightmost door will be open now, head outside and feed **Tepig** five GourmetTreats for a chance to battle it.

Head back to the cliffside (there's now a warp between Valor Cliffside and Valor Shore, it might be easiest to take the warp) and enter the room beyond. Interact with the neutral crystal, then head back into the dungeon via the cliffside once more. On the left, surf and fall down the hole. Pick up a hidden *Rare Candy*, then fall down the other hole and grab the *Leaf Stone* at the bottom!

Jump down the ledge, and head up the ladder here. On the right:

**ZCell 083: Valor Mountain (Neutral)**

!img("zcell083.png")

Head back down the ladder, activate the ice crystal, then use the warp to reach Valor Cliffside once more. Head all the way back up to the top and enter the summit.

### Valor Summit

Grab the *Dragon Scale* on the left of the summit.

Head up to the top when you're ready. The first battle:

!boss("VALORGIRATINA", "Volcanic Field")

Another straightforward boss where status conditions are key. The omniboost is a bit scary, though you can cancel it out with a move like Haze.

Heal, and follow the action to the top. Time for a double battle with Melia.

!partner(["Melia",:ENIGMA,5])

!dbattle(["Geara",:XENEXECUTIVE_3,2], ["Zetta",:XENEXECUTIVE_1,8], "Volcanic Field")

This battle is insane, but at least a fitting final Xen boss to Act 1 of Pokemon Rejuvenation! Zetta's Typhlosion is intense, as it's fast and its Eruption is strong. Grimmsnarl also gets basically at least 1 free screen unless you have Brick Break to remove it, so that is also tough to deal with. Their aces, Gengar and Silvally respectively, are also insanely fast and can kill most of your Pokemon. Melia's team used to be worse, TRUST ME IT WAS SO MUCH WORSE, but now she's a mostly competent doubles ally. Generally, this fight is won by targeting one of your two opponents and making sure Melia covers you.

The Volcanic Field can be used to your advantage: consider using your own Fire moves to take advantage of it. You can also transition to Sky Field with Bounce or to Volcanic Field with Dig, both of which you may be able to get a better footing in. 

In the beach area, follow the path.

Afterwards, return to the top of the mountain, collecting the souls as you go. You'll be thrust into a battle with Geara and Zetta again!

!partner(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,3])

!dbattle(["Geara",:XENEXECUTIVE_3,5], ["Zetta",:XENEXECUTIVE_1,12], "Volcanic Field")

Of course, all the opponents' Pokemon have 1 HP. That makes this one a breeze!

Once everything has been played out, talk to the group in Kakori. Take a Noctowl to Teila Resort and enter the building Tesla works in.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Uh... No? (-3 Crescent)
- Yes... (+2 Crescent)
- I like trouble (-2 Crescent)

Make a quick detour to Aquamarine Cave if you trusted Jenner earlier:

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If you trusted Jenner, talk to Melia in the Aquamarine Cave (+3 Melia)

Finally, go to Mynori Sea from Kakori. You'll see Shiny Tapu Koko on the dock.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Crawli on the dock after beating Tapu Koko in the jungle (+6 Crawli)

## Kristiline Help Quests

A whole bunch has become available now that we have the TM for Magma Drift and have cleared Valor Mountain. This includes the other two help quests for Kristiline Town... that we get in Kakori Village.

### Lurking Lighthouse

Head over to the Kakori Ranger HQ and talk to Alex inside. You'll get the *Lighthouse Key-J* to start *Lurking Lighthouse*! Grab an Electric-type from the PC. 

Our first destination is Jynnobi Pass. Enter the lighthouse on the left. Note the passcode: 9867. Head upstairs.

Back in Kakori, we will learn our next destination: Southbound Lighthouse in the Terajuma Shipyard map. 

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's true, she said it. (+2 Crawli)
- She's lying. (-2 Crawli)

!battle(["Drew",:TEAMAA_M,0], "Factory Field")

Grab the *Data Drive* and go right.

!battle(["Ann",:TEAMAA_F,0], "Factory Field")

On the next floor, step on the tiles to get the electrical balls to move.

!battle(["Sigyrd",:TEAMAA_M,0], "Factory Field")

Enter the door in the top right.

!battle(["Jalen",:TEAMAA_M,0], "Factory Field")

This completes the quest, and we can grab the rewards at the Kakori Help Center: $6,245, *Revival Herb*, and **Mareep**! (+1 Karma)

Completing this quest causes certain Pokemon to appear at night that didn't before, namely **Staryu** at the Terajuma Shipyard and **Clamperl** on Route 5.

One other result of this sidequest remains. Head back to Jirukala Cavern in the Mynori Sea. Make your way to the monitor at the end and input our code: 9867. Down this path you will find *TM51 Steel Wing*, plus:

**ZCell 084: Jirukala Cavern**

!img("zcell084.png")

### Tale of Two Hearts

Enter the house at the top of the hill in Kristiline Town to start *A Tale of Two Hearts*. Agree to accompany Odessa around the town. Talk to NPCs and enter buildings as you wish, eventually making your way to the Isle of Angels. Head up and cross the bridge to the right. After a conversation, return to Kristiline. Return her to her father.

You'll get to play as yourself in Odessa's body for a bit. Leave the spot on the floor enough times, then you'll be free to wander on a different map. Read the books, then hop over the boxes on the top right. Walking in front of the father or any red-eyed statues is a no-go. 

!battle(["Charthy",:POKEMONRANGER_M,0])

Pull the lever to the left - now the rightmost statue will be off.

!battle(["Perla",:POKEMONRANGER_F,0])

Make your way to the bottom right to pull another lever, then climb the ladder above. Once you escape, talk to a sailor at the eastern dock to get to Teila Resort. Talk to Amber at the top.

You'll eventually be taken to Valor Shore for a gauntlet!

!dbattle(["Holly",:COMMANDER,0], ["Rorim B.",:DISCOTEEN,3], "Beach Field")

!boss("SEAPRINCE", "Beach Field")

Take Heart will increase its Special Attack and Special Defense, making it hit very hard on both fields. The Phione are able come in and cover weaknesses and add to the amount of work you need to do at the end of this fight. It's a tough one made, tougher by the fact you aren't healed after the previous fight.

I recommend lowering its other stats, namely Speed and potentially Defense. It has no way to recover or raise these, so if you're able to get off a Scary Face and a Screech you can probably just one-shot the rest of its health bars.

With that out of the way, return to the Isle of Angels bridge. Return to her house and go up. The quest will be done - head back inside to get the *Phione Crest* from the father.

### Infinite Potential

With the previous two quests complete, head into the Kristiline Help Center. Talk to Jenkel to begin *Infinite Potential*.

Head to the Kakori Gym area to talk to Holly. Go next to the Terajuma Excavation Site and talk to the folks inside the building. Our next destination is Terajuma Beach. Talk to the suspicious individual. You'll need to follow him into the Jungle and to the right.

!battle(["Kurt",:COOLTRAINER_M,0], "Forest Field")

Take a Noctowl over to Valor Shore, then surf to the right below. Enter the shack.

!battle(["???",:UNKNOWN_1,1], "Factory Field")

Be very careful of a Xurkitree sweep.

Once you win, talk to Odessa in Kristiline. Follow her to the island to the south of the Pokemon Center and talk to her again. Reenter the Kristiline Help Center next.

Sounds like the Shipyard is our next destination, so head over there. Go right.

Grab a *Data Drive* inside and go up.

!battle(["Malamar",:DIABOLICALGENIUS,0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Not too bad thanks to Inkay's bad stats, despite the level disadvantage. Use Bug moves for OHKOs! 

Once this quest is over, return to the Kakori Help Center to get **Inkay**! (+1 Karma)

## Magma Drift Exploration

There are a few more sidequests and areas we can explore with Magma Drift.

First, grab Chansey from the PC, and take Noctowl to Terajuma Beach. Show it to the person below for an *Oval Charm*!

Next, enter the Izakaya in the Kakori Ranger HQ to get the *My Dearest Rowlet* quest.

Reenter the Tyluric Temple and progress as we did before. You'll see Rowlet on the right; talk to him and he will proceed further. Surf down once you reach an outside area and follow the path. Drift across the magma: go right first, then up the tornado. You'll eventually reach:

**ZCell 085: Tyluric Temple**

!img("zcell085.png")

You can also use a GourmetTreat to catch **Magby** and obtain *5 Exp. Candy L. Go back in the cave and drift all the way left.

**ZCell 086: Tyluric Temple**

!img("zcell086.png")

**ZCell 087: Tyluric Temple**

!img("zcell087.png")

You can pick *6 Roseli Berries*, *6 Wacan Berries*, and *6 Liechi Berries*.

!dbattle(["Marcie",:TEAMAA_F,0], ["Chikie",:XENANALYST_F,0], "Forest Field")

You will then be able to battle and catch **Rowlet**. Cute!

We've got business on Floria Island! Take the boat from Kakori to Gearen. Talk to Ayuda in the Help Center - for getting 75 Zygarde Cells we will get a *Lucky Egg*! Our next threshold is 100.

Enter the Magnolia library and talk to Zumi again. Now that we have Mareep, we will be given a **Mareep (Aevian)** as well at 6 *Exp. Candy M*. Our next target for *PictoZumi* is Toxel.

Next, take the truck to Sheridan. Make your way to Route 3's Phasial Cave, and take the ladder across some water in the bottom right to return to the Poliwag area. Now that we've found all six, we can catch **Poliwag**!

Take the time to ensure you have Metal Powder, a Poke Ball, and 3 Cell Batteries in your bag. Enter Carotos Mountain. Drift to the left and grab *TM36 Sludge Bomb*! Smash some rocks and drift to the right. Use two Blast Powders to get the **Cyndaquil** egg.

**ZCell 088: Carotos Mountain**

Head down to the corrupted cave area. Magma Drift here and follow the path to a *Poison Barb*. Back on land, continue following the path to the southeast and you'll find another spot to Magma Drift on the right. Hidden along it is another *Poison Barb*. Follow the path and use Spice Powder to catch **Aevian Paras**!

Now that we have Madelis' key, enter the ladder up and right from the Sheridan Arena entrance to reach the V.G.C.R. Use the key on the right and enter this room.

Here, we'll need to step on switches to progress. Follow the blue path to reach a machine containing the *Ancient Teachings*.

Next, we'll need to reach the room's center. Follow the green path to reach a machine.

Insert the necessary items to get **Ralts**! Push the red button at the bottom to escape the room.

Next, the people of Akuwa Town have FINALLY been returned to their home, so head to Akuwa Town.

In the top left house, you'll get a *Synthetic Seed* and *Cleanse Tag*. The house down from here contains move tutors:

The girl in the top right running in place can teach you some moves:

!tutor("Akuwa Town Move Tutor (Bottom Right)", [["Fire Pledge", "3 Red Shards"], ["Water Pledge", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Grass Pledge", "3 Green Shards"]])

!tutor("Akuwa Town Move Tutor (Top Right)", [["Stomping Tantrum", "5 Red Shards"], ["Iron Tail", "5 Blue Shards"], ["Endeavor", "4 Green Shards"], ["Iron Defense", "3 Yellow Shards"], ["Lash Out", "4 Blue Shards"], ["Corrosive Gas", "3 Yellow Shards"], ["Skill Swap", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Signal Beam", "3 Green Shards"], ["Coaching", "3 Red Shards"]])

!tutor("Akuwa Town Move Tutor (Top Left)", [["Fire Punch", "5 Red Shards"], ["Ice Punch", "5 Blue Shards"], ["Thunder Punch", "5 Yellow Shards"], ["Heal Bell", "3 Green Shards"], ["Burning Jealousy", "4 Red Shards"], ["Skitter Smack", "4 Green Shards"]])

Enter Larry Locksmith's house below to get a *Nugget*. In a house to the right you can obtain *5 Quick Balls*. Enter the mart to see a scene with Karrina. She'll then give you a *Repel*.

!shop("Akuwa Town Mart", ["Ultra Ball", "Luxury Ball", "Hyper Potion", "GourmetTreat", "Repel", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Escape Rope"])

Enter the ACDMC in the upper right. 

!shop("ACDMC", [["Sail Fossil", "10 Blue Shards"], ["Jaw Fossil", "10 Red Shards"], ["Skull Fossil", "10 Green Shards"], ["Armor Fossil", "10 Yellow Shards"]])

At the top right counter, you can revive any fossils you've obtained so far. So, that means you can now get: **Omanyte**, **Kabuto**, **Anorith**, **Lileep**, **Shieldon**, **Cranidos**, **Amaura**, and **Tyrunt**.

## Lyric Badge

Make your way back to Teila Resort and enter Club S.T.F.U.

*Special Scene: Calling Home* requires talking to Kreiss here.

!shop("Club S.T.F.U.", ["Hyper Potion", "Super Potion", "Burn Heal", "GourmetTreat"])

Talk to Reina in here to get a *Dusk Stone* and *Exp. Candy M*. Talk to the girl at the top. She'll tell us about building hype. Do whatever you have to do to build the hype - talk to people, battle trainers, change the song with the guy on the right. The battles here (note that major character fights are 2v2):

!battle(["Lucina",:GUITARIST,0], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Reina",:TRENDYGIRL,2], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Crawli",:LEADER_CRAWLI,2], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,4], "Concert Venue")

!battle(["Amanda",:TRAINER_AMANDA,4], "Concert Venue")

!dbattle(["Alex",:POKEMONRANGER_F1,2], ["Sam",:POKEMONRANGER_M1,2], "Concert Venue")

A breeder will show up at some point, too! Beating her grants *7 Exp. Candy M*.

!battle(["Laila",:POKEBREEDER_F,0], "Concert Venue")

Once you've hyped to the max, head into the battlefield.

!battle(["Amber",:LEADER_AMBER,0], "Concert Venue")

!move("FEVERPITCH")

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- End the battle on Concert Field Lv. 1 (-2 Amber)
- Beat Amber on any other field than Concert Lv. 1 (+3 Amber)

It's time for the second gym battle on the Concert Venue, though this time under different circumstances. Most notably, Fever Pitch, Magnitude, and Reversal all hit for full damage on the high levels of the Concert Venue, so you're going to take lots of damage. Depending on how much you care about relationship points, you can get away with intentionally nerfing the Concert Venue and using Stomping Tantrum for huge damage. There are lots of ways to do so: intentionally missing low-accuracy moves works, raising Evasion works, moves like Play Nice and Tickle will work as well. If you're going to stick it out on the maximum hype field - use the field's tools to your own advantage: max power Magnitude is a fantastic choice if you can get around the Air Balloons.

Win to get the Lyric Badge, which brings the level cap up to Lv. 60, and *TM50 Overheat*! Head outside and watch the cutscene.
