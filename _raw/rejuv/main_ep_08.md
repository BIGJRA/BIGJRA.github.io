## Kristiline Town

Talk to the crew. Kreiss will give you the Glacier Badge, raising our level cap to Lv. 55! 

Head outside to start exploring Kristiline Town. To the left:

**ZCell 070: Kristiline Town**

!img("zcell070.png")

Enter the Sapphire Museum. Talk to the old man to begin the *Museum Quest*. Back outside, enter the Kristiline Eatery to the left. Talk to a man here to begin the *Aquamarine Ore* quest.

!shop("Kristiline Eatery", ["Lava Cookie"])

Outside, pluck the *Occa Berry* and enter the TM Shop.

!shop("Kristiline TMs", [["RM02 Avalanche", 20000], ["RM03 Zap Cannon", 30000], ["RM04 Metronome", 10000], ["RM06 Retaliate", 15000], ["RM07 Dynamic Punch", 25000], ["RM08 Vacuum Wave", 20000], ["RM09 Tri Attack", 20000], ["TM140 Ice Fang", 10000], ["TM141 Fire Fang", 10000], ["TM142 Thunder Fang", 10000], ["TM143 Psycho Cut", 25000], ["TM157 Breaking Swipe", 25000]])

Back inside the church, you'll find:

ZCell 036: Church of Theolia

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image37.png"/>

Outside, pick up *TM07 Hail*. On the beach below there is a hidden *Icicle Plate*.

Surf down at the Isle of Angels.

The big island to the south hides a *Magical Seed, Ice Gem, Max Repel*. If you have 10 Occa Berries to trade, the fisherman here will trade you a *Deepseatooth* or a *Deepseascale*. We already have one of each, though.

A smaller island contains a hidden *Dive Ball*, another has a *Rock Gem*. Grab the *Shed Shell* on another island.

Reenter the town.

Cross the bridge to the south part of Kristiline. Inside a building is another guy in the virtual badge quest!

-   Sneasel, Level 44.
    -   Metal Claw

    -   Ice Beam
-   Cloyster, Level 44.
    -   Surf
    -   Icicle Spear

-   Piloswine, Level 46. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Stomping Tantrum
    -   Blizzard
    -   Amnesia
    -   Rock Tomb

Pryce is an easy fight with the Cyndaquil route - Typhlosion and Jolteon will do most of the work: use Miltank to wall, Qwilfish to get up entry hazards and if you can make sure Jolteon prevents Dewgong from setting up its defenses and its special attack with Stockpile thanks to the field you should be set. Get the seventh *Virtual Badge*!

Gym Leader Clair (Glitch Field)
-   Dragonair, Level 51.
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Dragonbreath
    -   Double Team
    -   Ice Beam
-   Ampharos, Level 51.
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Thunderbolt
-   Rhydon, Level 53. @ Passho Berry.
    -   Earthquake

-   Kingdra, Level 55. @ Scope Lens.
    -   Draco Meteor
    -   Hydro Pump
    -   Agility
    -   Focus Energy

Next up is Clair. I thought this one was easy actually: Jolteon with Wish and Hidden Power Ice easily takes both Dragonair and Ampharos, as well as Gyarados if you can weaken it a bit first. Letting Gligar take out Rhydon and cripple Gyarados with Jolteon taking care of the dragons left only Kingdra, who can easily be taken down by Miltank and Qwilfish! Win for your eighth *Virtual Badge*! Garret will also then give you 25 AP points!

Talk to the other guy in this house. Give the Aquamarine Ore to the guy for a *Prism Scale*!

Enter the museum for $500 and talk to the director. He will send us on a quest to Goldenleaf Town, so we'll take care of that as soon as we return.

To proceed the story a bit, head into Amber's room and talk to the crew. We must return to the Sapphire Museum in Kristiline Town. If you retrieved the painter, now you can choose a sculpture and get paid
$10000. There is a *Cherish Ball* in the trash to the right.

Head upstairs and read about Regice.

Her team focuses on a lot of fast, hard hitting Pokemon that can U-Turn out if need be. They're all frail bar Gliscor though, so if you have the bulk to survive hits across your team, you can take them out. Not a noteworthy fight after Angie, to be honest.

To continue the story, skip ahead a few sections to Carotos, Pt 2. Otherwise there's tons of optional content that is now open to us!

Head into the help center - it's time for some Help Center Quests!

## Kristiline Help Center Requests

We'll be exploring some new areas with Rock Climb throughout these quests, so I recommend reading to at least check what new areas you can explore. If you haven't yet gotten it, the Golden Claws from the AP center are useful here!

### HQuest 18: Lighthouse

Talk to the ranger on the boat dock of Kristiline Town to get the *Lighthouse Key*.

Take the ranger teleporter to Terajuma Shore, and surf around to the lighthouse. Enter, and go up.

Read the note, and remember the code ends in 67.

Head all the way north to Route 5 and enter this lighthouse. Read the note, and remember the code starts with 98.

Enter Aquamarine Cave from the west, and head into the cave with the big door. Rock Climb up to get *TM20 Safeguard*!

Go to where Amber fell into a hole. Jump down, and surf to the right. Rock climb up here.

Hidden up here is *Green Shard, Rock Gem, Blue Shard*. There is also a visible *Sea Incense* at the top, and a *Link Heart* towards the center at the bottom.

Make your way to the ladder in this area and go up. *Fresh Water*, *Water Gem*, *Dive Ball* are hidden here. Exit this room at the top to reach the Secluded Shore. Talk to Dylan, then head up. Here you'll find Poliwag \#6!

Enter this lighthouse and go up. Read the note to learn that the Ampharos are in Jirukala Cavern!

Exit, and head up. We can explore this new bit of Route 6 if we want. Here you'll find Kingler and Hoppip, but also:

ZCell 039: Route 6

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image40.png"/>

Add , and return to the area above where we fought Valarie in Terajuma Jungle. Enter Jirukala Cavern here, and rock climb up.

In the trees here, you can headbutt! You have an 11% chance each to get 3 *Oran, Sitrus, and Leppa Berries*, but also an 11% chance to get **Greedent**, 22% chance to get Skwovet, and 33% chance to get **Applin**!

Pick up *Green Shard*, then, on the right, grab *Modest Mint* and *TM131 Bullet Seed* then head down.

Enter the password 9867 into the door. Beat the grunts, then the ranger will take the Ampharos back.

Pick up:

ZCell 040: Jirukala Cavern

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image41.png"/>

Completing this quest also gives us access to some stationary water Pokemon for GourmetTreats - but only at night. Head to Terajuma Shore to get **Staryu**, to Route 6 to get **Clamperl**, and Route 5 to get **Slowpoke**.

While we're up on Route 5, Rock Climb here to get a *Adamant Mint*, and access to Jeminra Cave but without the need for Safari Balls. Grab the *TM144 Cross Poison* inside.

Rock Smash one of the rocks here, and use Purify in the battle. Any Pyukumuku we've found so far should have it. Then, exit the cave and re-enter through the Safari Zone. Surf through the cave. Chase **Wimpod** into the bottom left corner for a battle!

Return to the help center to get: $6245, *Revival Herb*, and **Mareep**. (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 19: Take my Quiz!

Head outside and enter the house in the top right of town. Talk to the guy here. The answers to his quiz are: 4, Calmness, and 5.

After...that... head back to the help center to get $10000. (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 20: Defend Me!

Head into Aquamarine Cave, and head to the large open basement room.

Head west from where Amber's bed was, then surf to the west side of the room. Beat all the AA grunts in here.

Return to the help center to get $4000 and *Mystic Water*.

### HQuest 21: Research

Head outside and talk with Dr. Jenkel. We must find and talk to 7 people all around the island.

- Enter the house directly to the left of the dock bridge in Kristiline. Talk to the old lady.
- Enter the Kristiline mart, and talk to the girl in the aisles.
- Enter the south middle villa in Teila Resort, and talk to the lady on the left side.
- talk to the hiker hiding behind the south left villa in Teila Resort.

While you're in Teila, notice that there is a new Move Tutor on the east side:

Teila Resort Move Tutor

| Move      | Price         |
|-----------|---------------|
|Aqua Tail  |4 Blue Shards  |
|Magic Coat |4 Blue Shards  |
|Electroweb |4 Blue Shards  |

Anyways,

- Enter the construction hut in Terajuma Jungle and talk to the
    guy on the couch.
- Talk to someone in the middle house in the row of houses in Kakori village.
- Talk to the other person in the same house.

Then, head outside... After getting teleported, claim your rewards: *Exp. Candy L* and *Up-Grade*. (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 22: ???

Take a teleporter to Terajuma Shore. Surf up to the left of the shoreline, towards the strange house. Talk to Jenkel, then enter.

Defeat the first few trainers, then grab the *Data Drive*.

Head up, and you'll have to battle 6 Inkay ranging from Level 50 to 90. Really, if you don't let the 80/90 ones set up on you with Superpower, you'll be able to come out ahead.

As a result, we now have access to the move relearner in Sheridan Village! Talk to the sister for a free *Heart Scale*.

Now that we have the Data Drive, take the teleporter to return to Ranger HQ, and go into the hallway room 2nd from the right.

Head up twice and interact with the upper left computer to battle Porygon!

Return to the Kristiline Help Center to get your reward: **Inkay**!
(+1 Karma)

For completing all five, you will be gifted **Eevee**! (+1 Karma)

## Floria Island Rock Climb

That's about all we can do on Terajuma Island alone, far as side quests are concerned. The boat can take us all sorts of places, including Gearen, Akuwa, and Secret Shore. Anyways, first, we're going to go to the Secret Shore. Again, this is optional, so skip ahead if you want.

Enter Xen Lab again and take the teleporter here to get to the back room. Enter the cave. Surf to the right to find a hidden *Link Heart*. Then, head back to use Rock Climb. Enter the cave up here to get *TM81 X-Scissor*! There's also an *Up-Grade* in the bookshelf.

Leave the swamp and return to Gearen Help Center. Now that we've found 35 Zygarde cells, Mei and Ayuda will give us the *Soothe Bell*! This can cut down on the number of friendships berries we need to use from now on. Our next target is 45.

Enter the Magnolia library and talk to Zumi again. Now that we have Mareep, we will be given an **Aevian Mareep** as well at 6 *Exp. Candy M*. Our next quest is for Toxel.

Remember that impossible fight in the Aqua Building? Well, I was able to beat it at this point, so why not give it a shot. Not essential to get done now, but if you can, why not.

Challenger Mercury (No Field)
-   Abra, Level 10. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Light Screen
    -   Thunderwave
    -   Trick Room
    -   Reflect
-   Kadabra, Level 45. @ Red Card.
    -   Psychic
    -   Energy Ball
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Calm Mind
-   Alakazam, Level 85. @ Twistedspoon.
    -   Psychic
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Toxic
    -   Recover

You could use the Kadabra and Abra to set up a sweeper, or just use something that can live Alakazam's two attacks and hit hard. A Shedinja can also work - let it get paralyzed by Abra, then Alakazam can't touch it, though Kadabra can. If you win against her, you can get *Star Shard 2*.

I recommend taking another trip to the AP shop. If you haven't gotten the Exp. All or the Golden Axe, Hammer, Surfboard, and Claws, do so ASAP. On deck will be the Golden Driftboard and the Golden Gauntlet.

Head to Sheridan Village, and enter Route 3. Using Flash if you want, head back to the Poliwag area of Phasial Cave. Now that we've found all six, we can catch **Poliwag**!

Head back out and into Goldenleaf Town. Enter Narcissa's Gym and talk to the guy at the front. Make your way all the way back through Backstage Theatre and enter the mirror.

Enter this door at the top, then interact with the painting up here. Follow Mew out of the room, through the mirror to get the *Odd Key*, and to the Lost Castle.

Here, we're going to want to read all the books and keep track of all the numbers. Head up the stairs and talk to Dusclops, and enter the following: 0044, 6677, 3645, 9043, 7171. Enter the next room and get ready for a series of battles. It's a gauntlet of 3, but nearly everything that is used is ghost, psychic, and/or dark type, so you should be able to take them out with ease with the right coverage. Shatter the bubble.

Return to town and enter the eastern house. Talk to the guy and send him to Kristiline Town. Then, enter Wispy Ruins through the Wispy Tower area entrance. Climb the rocks and head down the ivy into Wispy Chasm.

Wispy Chasm Depths

| Cave              | %        | Water        | %        |
|-------------------|----------|--------------|----------|

| Claydol           | 6        |              |          |
| Xatu              | 5        |              |          |

| Old Rod         | %        | Good Rod        | %   |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------|----|
| Frillish        | 70       | Whiscash        | 60 |
| Barboach        | 30       | Frillish        | 20 |
|                 |          | Corphish        | 20 |

Head all the way down, picking up hidden *Dark Gem* as you go. Around the bottom is the 6-badge gate. Open the chest inside to get **Scraggy**!

In the chasm room, head towards the middle then go down to get a *Rare Candy* and *TM65 Shadow Claw*. Surf across up above to get to the 3-badge gate. Open the chest to get a *Shiny Stone*.

Head back up the ivy, enter the room on the right, and go back down. There is a hidden *Yellow Shard, Ghost Gem*, and *Reverse Candy* Grab the *Poke Doll* when you go down. Surf to the south to get to the 7-badge gate. Open the chest to get an *Odd Keystone*.

Exit the ruins and make your way back to Akuwa Town. Enter Evergreen Forest and climb the rocks to get an *Icy Rock*.

## Amethyst Cave 2nd Visit

Head to Route 2 and enter Amethyst Cave. Start by going to the room up from the first, where there is water and where we got a cell and activated a panel once upon a time. Head down from the panel and rock climb to get *TM01 Work Up*.

Next, enter the room to the right of this one, and rock climb down next to the waterfall. Talk to April, then activate Panel 3 to the right. Grab the hidden *Rock Gem, Steel Gem*, and *Water Gem*. Head down from here and talk to April again.

ZCell 041: Amethyst Cave

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image42.png"/>

Return to the entrance of the cave from Route 2. Take the stairs to the right, then head across the first bridge on top. Rock climb here, pick up the hidden *Zinc*, and head in.

Amethyst Cave (Rock Climb Areas)

| Cave          | %        | Water          | %        |
|---------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Graveler      | 34       | Remoraid       | 65       |
| Woobat        | 20       | Barboach       | 30       |

|                 |          | Octillery       | 20       |

Exit on the bottom doors to the left to meet Alisha, the ninth and final *lost kid* for the Lost Camp! There is a hidden *Carbos* here.

Back up from here, grab the *Elixir* and enter the cave on the left.

Security Drone Regirock (Crystal Cavern Field)
-   Regirock, Level 60. @ Lum Berry. 2 Shields.
    -   Stone Edge
    -   Rest
    -   Curse
    -   Earthquake

Not impossible if you can lower its attack with a burn or something similar!

Activate Panel 4, then head to the upper right door and enter for a similar battle!

Security Drone Registeel (Crystal Cavern Field)
-   Registeel, Level 60. @ Lum Berry. 2 Shields.
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Rest
    -   Curse
    -   Iron Head

Grab the *Moon Dial* and activate Panel 5 here, then head down the ladder on the left. Grab hidden *Rock Gem, Super Repel, and Ether*.

Talk to the ex-Xen Grunt in the open area. Head down the ladder here and activate Panel 6 on the right.

Head down and rock climb down from here. We're gonna need to smash the crystals in this new area somehow: the wild Geodude have Magnitude and can do it, alternatively, if you have the Bulldoze T.M. then you can use that. Once you succeed, head down to the bottom of this area and interact with this crystal for a chance to catch **Aevian Lapras**!

With all six panels activated, head back to the Xen grunt and activate the machine. The Xen guy will head up, so grab the hidden *PP Up* and climb the ladder. Grab the Rift Notes and prepare yourself.

Talk to the Grunt and save in front of the statue. Talk to the grunt again, and you'll have to fight:

Lingering Regret Nancy (Mountain Field)
-   Whimsicott, Level 51. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Moonblast
    -   Hurricane
    -   Giga Drain
    -   Tailwind
-   Mr. Mime, Level 53. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Hidden Power Fairy
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Psychic
    -   Icy Wind
-   Galarian Weezing, Level 52. @ Black Sludge.
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Strange Steam
-   Gardevoir, Level 53. @ Babiri Berry.
    -   Psychic
    -   Moonblast
    -   Mystical Fire
    -   Calm Mind
-   Sylveon, Level 55. @ Leftovers.
    -   Psyshock
    -   Calm Mind
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Hyper Voice

This is an easy team to beat if you were able to beat Angie! It doesn't really have a ton of good answers for a solid Steel / Poison move core.

Dimensional Rift Chandelure (Mountain Field)
-   Chandelure, Level 58. @ Demon Stone. 1 Shield. Stats:
    110/25/69/200/110/100
    -   Power Gem
    -   Ominous Wind
    -   Icy Wind
    -   Heat Wave

This thing has Protean, so if you can swap its type away from fire, it will actively take damage from the field. A team of six that can survive its attacks can wear it down easily, especially if any of your mons have a lot of Sp. Def. With its 100 base speed, it will outspeed most of your Pokemon, so Trick Room trivializes this fight.

Exit at the top and talk to Manny. He'll give you a *Shiny Stone*. Hidden around is a *Rare Candy, Elixir, Iron*.

At night, you'll find:

ZCell 042: Cliffside Grave (Night ONLY)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image43.png"/>

Interact with the grave at the top and insert the Cursed Candle we got a while ago to obtain **Litwick**!

Return to the basement level to talk to April. She'll give us the *Phase Dial*! Head in and go up.

Chaotic Fusion Solrock (Crystal Cavern Field)
-   Fused Solrock, Level 50, 2 Shields.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Zen Headbutt
    -   Cosmic Power
    -   Solar Flare

It's easy with a good super effective move! Now you can use the Phase Dial to fuse your own Solrock and Lunatone.

That's all we can do in this area for now.

## Lost Camp Pt. 2

Now, we should have found all nine kids. Ctrl + F the phrase "lost kid" in the guide to get any that you missed. So, head back to Route 4, and enter the lost camp.

Donate the last $7500 to Maman. After a scene, head back outside and take the truck to Sheridan Village.

## Carotos Mountain 2nd Visit

Head up to Sheridan Arena and head up to the house formerly belonging to Keta.

Luckily Aelita's team is pretty good here: Quick Guard support and Reflect will basically guarantee you a win. Win and head into Carotos Mountain. Talk to Aelita at the HQ, then head down right to the elevator. Head over to fight SEC for the last time and catch his Shadow Slakoth.

Corrupted Cave

| Cave             | %        |
|------------------|----------|
| Salandit         | 30       |
| **Golbat**       | 25       |
| Zubat            | 20       |

| **Muk (Alolan)** | 9        |
| **Torkoal**      | 1        |

You'll also find **Alolan Grimer** and **Garbodor** walking around in certain parts. Aelita will join us!

Hidden in the first map is a *Poison Gem* and 2 *Super Repels*. Follow the path down and to the left. Talk to the maids, and defeat Deborah.

After this scene, follow Aelita into the room to the left, then climb the vines to enter the room to the right. Observe the position of the blocks.

Set the blocks in the left room into this position, then enter the door. Enter the newly revealed room and prepare for a fight.

Ancient Kingdra (Blessed Field)
-   Kingdra, Level 55. @ Dragon Fang.
    -   Origin Pulse
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Luster Purge
    -   Ice Beam / Aura Sphere / Mystical Fire (Random)

Luckily, not too bad. If you beat the one in the ancient forest you can do this one. Lowering its special attack can be key. If one of the randomly generated final moves counters your team you can reset for a different one.

Enter this next room. Across this bridge is the alignment we need to set these blocks into. A solution (thanks Elucidative!):

1. Pangoro left all the way, down all the way, right 2, up 2, right 3, up 3
2. Zorua left all the way, down all the way, right 2, down all the way, right 3, down 3
3. Apple right 4, up 2, right 3
4. Chimecho right all the way (it'll be stopped by the Zorua), up all the way, right all the way, up 2, left all the way
5. Zorua left 1
6. Budew left all the way (it'll be stopped by the Zorua), up 3, right all the way
7. Zorua right 1, up 3

Head east and battle Esther, then take out another Kingdra. Enter the door to the right. Head down the stairs, then out the bottom. Follow the path to get *TM86 Grass Knot*.

Head down the stairs to the west for an optional challenge.

1. Pink Shellos left, down all the way, left all the way, down 5, left, down all the way, right, down all the way
2. Starly up 1, right all the way, down 1, right 2, down 6, left, down all the way, left (it'll be stopped by the Apple), down all the way, left 1
3. Apple right 1, up, right 1, up 7, right, up 7, left all the way, down
5, right 1
4. Omanyte right 1, up 3, right, up 7, left 3, up 1
5. Lopunny up, right, up all the way, left, up 3, left 7, up all the way, right 1, up 7, right, up 7, right 4, up, right, up
6. Shinx left 2, up all the way, right, up all the way, left, up 3, left
9, up 5, right 1
7. Pink Shellos right 5, down all the way, right, down all the way, left, down 3, right all the way, up 2
8. Blue Shellos up 1, left all the way, down all the way, right, down all the way, right 5, down all the way, right, down all the way, left, down

11. Slugma left all the way, up, left all the way, down, right 1, down 5, left all the way (it'll be stopped by Darkrai), down 5, left 3, up
12. Darkrai right 6, up all the way, right all the way, down all the way

Up from here in the newly opened area, you can touch a statue to fight **Zorua**!

Then, head back up and take note of each of statue placement - we're going to need to move each into that spot upstairs yet again. The solution:

1. Omanyte right all the way, down all the way, left 1, down 4, right 7, up 3
2. Zorua down 1, right 2
3. Pangoro down 8, left 4, up
4. Starly right 2, down 2
5. Zorua left 1, down 1, right 1, down all the way (it'll be stopped by Aelita), left 7, up all the way
6. Starly right 1, up, right all the way, up all the way, left 2, up 8, right all the way, down 2
7. Chingling up, left 3, up 8, left all the way, down, left 2
8. Darkrai right all the way, up all the way, left 2, up 8, left 1
9. Apple down 1, left all the way (it'll be stopped by Darkrai), down all the way
10. Darkrai right

Enter the newly opened area at the top.

There are encounters here in the water.

Deborah will mock you here but tell her "from the start" to progress.

We'll end up back in Sheridan. Head into the village proper and talk to Aelita to progress.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- But why? (Aelita +1)
- A good decision. (Aelita -2)

Accept the fast travel, step on the pad, and enter the left room. Exit the room and surf across to the right and go all the way down the vines and out. Itemfinder around here to get a Moon Stone! Step on the pad, then go up. Head up to the battlefield.

Angie's Right Hand Man Cera (Corrupted Cave)
-   Groudon, Level 57. @ Lum Berry.
    -   Precipice Blades
    -   Rest
    -   Lava Plume
    -   Solarbeam

Luckily, because of the field, Groudon will get Poisoned. If you can deal just enough damage for it to get knocked out here, you'll be fine.

You'll then get the *Magma Stone but* be presented with a choice. It is up to you what to choose: the story will split here a bit. Choosing "Keep It" grants (+1 Karma). Jump to the section corresponding to your choice.

## Valor Mountain

### Entering the Mountain (Kept It Route)

Head back to the room Aelita was in, then follow Tommen out. After a brief cutscene, you'll be back in Sheridan.

Make your way to unfreeze the T.M. shop in Kristiline. You'll be given *TM110 Magma Drift*!

Head back into the shop, and they'll have wares:

Kristiline T.M. Shop (\<12 Badges)

|Item                |Price |
|--------------------|------|
|*RM02 Avalanche*    |$50000|
|*RM03 Zap Cannon*   |$50000|
|*RM04 Metronome*    |$25000|
|*RM06 Retaliate*    |$25000|
|*RM07 Dynamic Punch*|$50000|
|*RM08 Vacuum Wave*  |$25000|
|*RM09 Tri Attack*   |$25000|
|*TM141 Fire Fang*   |$20000|
|*TM142 Thunder Fang*|$20000|
|*TM143 Psycho Cut*  |$70000|

Buy these if you'd like!

Return to Teila Resort, and enter Tesla's Villa. Head upstairs and talk to Valarie and Venam.

Head to Valor Shore, and drift across the lava and enter. Get the *Emotion Powder* as you walk in.

Head to the upper left and go up the ladder. Beat the Xen scientist here and activate the Fire Source Crystal! Then, take the ladder here at the bottom. Activate the Ice Crystal here.

Head down the left ladder from the entrance, and notice that the Chamber of Awakening at the top is now open.

We get to choose whether or not we are going to save Amber. You don't have to, but if you choose not to, characters will hate you and you will not get the karma. If you choose to do so, read the saving Amber section below. If not, skip ahead to the convergence section.

### Saving Amber (Kept It Route)

Enter the chamber, and head up and stand in the circle for another titanic battle!

Kyogre (Water Surface Field)
-   Kyogre, Level 60.
    -   Muddy Water
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Ice Beam

This is a bit harder than Groudon since the field really helps it, rather than hurts it. Long story short, its Muddy Water boosted by rain and water surface will decimate your entire team. And it has 3 shields. If you have anything with Thunder, it hits 100% of the time and may be the best tool you have to take it out. I managed to win this thing on my Fire Monotype, so I'm sure you will eventually find a way.

After winning, Madelis will give you the *HQ Railnet Key*.

### Entering the Mountain (Gave It Away Route)

Head back to the room Aelita was in, then follow Tommen out. After a brief cutscene, you'll be back in Sheridan.

Return to Teila Resort, and enter Tesla's Villa. Head upstairs and talk to Valarie and Venam. Accept the fast travel. Head all the way up. After a conversation, enter the door.

Talk to Venam up from here. Then, head up the ladder to 1F and head right. You'll get the *Emotion Powder*.

Head to the upper left and go up the ladder. Beat the Xen scientist here and activate the Fire Source Crystal! Then, take the ladder here at the bottom. Activate the Ice Crystal here.

Head down the left ladder from the entrance, and you'll notice the Chamber of Awakening is now open. and enter the Chamber of Awakening at the top that is now open. Talk with Venam here then head up.

We get to choose whether or not we are going to save Amber. You don't have to, but if you choose not to, characters will hate you and you will not get the karma. If you choose to do so, read the saving Amber section below. If not, skip ahead to the convergence section.

### Saving Amber (Gave It Away Route)

Enter the chamber and talk to Venam. Then head up from here and stand in the circle for another titanic battle!

Kyogre (Water Surface Field)
-   Kyogre, Level 60.
    -   Muddy Water
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Ice Beam

Luckily in this route, Venam helps us defeat Kyogre. The field really helps it, rather than hurts it. Long story short, its Muddy Water boosted by rain and water surface will decimate your entire team. And it has 3 shields. If you have anything with Thunder, it hits 100% of the time and may be the best tool you have to take it out. I managed to win this thing on my Fire Monotype, so I'm sure you will eventually find a way.

After winning, Madelis will give you the *HQ Railnet Key*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Don't wait till it's too late. (Venam +2)
- Be kind to her. (venam +1)
- ... (Venam -2)

### Scaling Mt. Valor (Both Routes Converge)

So now the routes essentially converge, so I will cover all the Pokemon and items we can get in the mountain as we scale it. Even if you choose not to fight Kyogre and save Amber, there is a Zygarde cell you can get by entering the Chamber of Awakening.

ZCell 043: Chamber of Awakening

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image44.png"/>

Return to the first floor. Each mood of the mountain has different encounters we can fight.

Icy Valor Mountain

| Cave                       | %        |
|----------------------------|----------|
| **Sandygast (Aevian Ice)** | 20       |

| Bergmite                   | 1        |

While the cave is Icy, pick up the *Revive* at the bottom left, as well as the *Ice Heal* and hidden *Water Stone* in the bottom right of the snow. *TM132 Icicle Spear* is at the top right of this area as well.

Head up at the top of this area and enter the base. Go upstairs, grab *Blunder Policy* and *Metal Powder*, and push the switch in the top right corner. Pressing the switch next to Reina grants (+3 Reina Relationship Points). Back downstairs, try to leave through the top and you'll get teased again. Try to leave through the bottom.

After... something... Saki gives you a *Revive* if you kept the Magma Stone, but if not, you'll finally get the T.M. for Magma Drift!

Head up through the newly destroyed door. Go up and activate the Neutral Source Crystal!

|         |      | Staryu          | 20       |

Head back down from here, and you'll find:

ZCell 044: Valor Mountain (Normal)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image45.png"/>

You can also get **Heracross** if you go down and through the barricade.

Head all the way up from here, pick up the *Hyper Potion*, and go up the ladder. Loop your way around to the left. Grab *TM147 Tail Slap* hiding behind the Ice Source Crystal, then activate it. To the left, you'll find:

ZCell 045: Valor Mountain (Ice)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image46.png"/>

Make your way around and up. Activate the fire crystal at the top here.

Fiery Valor Mountain (Burning Cave Field)

| Cave                        | %        |
|-----------------------------|----------|

| **Heatmor**                 | 5        |
| **Turtonator**              | 5        |

Head down and right, then drift across to find **Vulpix**! Give it a GourmetTreat for a battle.

By clicking each crystal in succession, make your way to the top of the room. Back at the top of the room, fall down the hole to the left. You'll find:

ZCell 046: Valor Mountain (Ice)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image47.png"/>

Fall down the hole again, then proceed all the way through the barricade and back up the mountain. This time, take the ladder at the top.

Exit to the Valor Cliffside. Pick up hidden *HP Up* and *Blast Powder*. On the Gave It Away Route, if you ignored saving Amber, now you will get
(-2 Venam Relationship Points).

    -   Rock Slide
    -   Body Slam
    -   Knock Off

Time for another fight with Eli and Sharon. This is a 12v6 with the help of Venam, so it really shouldn't be that much of a problem. Make sure Gyarados doesn't set up!

ZCell 047: Valor Cliffside

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image48.png"/>

Head down from here.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're cruel. (Venam +3)
- ... (Neutral)
- She deserved it. (Venam -4)

Head up and into the next room. Grab *TM134 Rock Blast*.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We can do this together! (Melia +3, Venam +3)
- Sorta like that, yeah. (Melia +1, Venam +1)
- Team Xen is all I care about. (Melia -2, Venam -2)

Activate the fire crystal here, then return to the main dungeon through the cliffside. On the right side, you'll find:

ZCell 048: Valor Mountain (Fire)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image49.png"/>

Head down and go to the left. Drift across then jump in the hole twice.

ZCell 049: Valor Mountain (Fire)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image50.png"/>

Also, talk to Heatmor with a GourmetTreat for a chance to catch it.

Next, head up at the top of this room to reenter the blockade. Upstairs the rightmost door will be open now, head outside and feed **Tepig** a bunch of GourmetTreats for a chance to battle it.

Head back to the cliffside and enter the room beyond. Interact with the neutral crystal, then head back into the dungeon via the cliffside once more. On the left, surf and fall down the hole. Pick up a hidden *Rare Candy*, then fall down the other hole and grab the *Leaf Stone* at the bottom!

Jump down the ledge, and head up the ladder here. On the right:

ZCell 050: Valor Mountain (Normal)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image51.png"/>

Head back down the ladder, activate the ice crystal, then enter the teleporter at the bottom of this map.

Head all the way back up to the top and enter the summit.

## Valor Summit

Grab the *Dragon Scale* on the left of the summit.

Head up to the top when you're ready. The first battle:

Renegade Giratina (Volcano Top Field)
-   Giratina, Level 60. @ Griseous Orb.
    -   Shadow Force
    -   Earth Power
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Magma Drift

If you have Blizzard it can help a ton with this fight. Volcanic Top -\>
Mountain -\> Snowy Mountain across two blizzards, but back to Volcanic Top after it uses Magma Drift. You can also consider paralyzing and poisoning it if necessary. Ultimately this isn't that bad of a fight if you have a decent strategy.

Heal, and follow the action to the top. Time for a double battle with Melia.

Team Xen Geara and Zetta (Volcano Top Field)
-   Krookodile, Level 53. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Earthquake
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Crunch
    -   Low Kick

    -   False Surrender
    -   Spirit Break
    -   Reflect
    -   Light Screen

-   Weavile, Level 53. @ Razor Claw.
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Brick Break
    -   Night Slash

    -   Stone Edge
    -   Sucker Punch
    -   Night Slash
    -   Brick Break
-   Typhlosion, Level 55. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Eruption
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Focus Blast

-   Dragonite, Level 54. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Brick Break

-   Silvally, Level 55. @ Ground Memory.
    -   Multi-Attack
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Heat Wave
    -   Thunder

This battle is insane, but at least a fitting final Xen boss to Act 1 of Pokemon Rejuvenation! Zetta's Typhlosion is intense, as it's fast and its Eruption is strong. Grimmsnarl also gets basically at least 1 free screen unless you have Brick Break to remove it, so that is also tough to deal with. Their aces, Gengar and Silvally respectively, are also insanely fast and can kill most of your Pokemon. Worst of all about half of Melia's team kind of sucks and isn't really that helpful in this fight!

The Volcano Top field can be used to your advantage: consider using your own Fire moves to take advantage of it. You can also transition to Sky Field with Bounce or to Volcanic Field with Dig, both of which you may be able to get a better footing in. Regardless of the field effect, the key is making sure that you have the right pairings at any given time, so Melia's Pokemon don't get one-shotted. Unfortunately, this means a LOT of trial and error with the AI, but eventually you'll be able to find the exact chinks in Zetta and Geara's armor and can take them out.

In the beach area, follow the path.

Afterwards, return to the top of the mountain, collecting the souls as you go. You'll be thrust into a battle with Geara and Zetta again, but all their Pokemon are at 1HP and you are supposed to easily win.

Make your way to the bridge in Terajuma Jungle and approach Melia.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes. (Melia +2)

Now, the next destination is the gym battle. If you want to progress, skip the next section.

## Post-Valor Quests

We can pick up a few Pokemon and items! Head to Ranger HQ in Kakori. Talk to Crawli at the entrance for ZCrystal *Buginium-Z*. We can't use it yet, though.

First, if you didn't save Amber, enter the Chamber of Awakening in Valor mountain, where you'll find the *HQ Railnet Key*.

Next, if you went down the Gave It Away Route, the T.M. Store in Kristiline is now open. The list of T.M.'s they sell is in the top of the previous section.

The people of Akuwa Town have... FINALLY been returned to their home, so head to Akuwa Town.

The girl in the top right running in place can teach you some moves:

Enter the house to the right to get 5 *Quick Balls*.

Head to any shop that sells regular Poke Balls and make sure you have one in your bag. Now that we have Madelis' key, take the boat over to Secret Shore. Head to the southwestern most island, and rock climb. Here begins a quest for two Hoenn Pokemon.

1.  Talk to Mudkip on the southwest island (requires Rock Climb/Cut)
2.  Talk to Mudkip on the southern middle island
3.  Talk to Mudkip on the center right island (requires Cut)
4.  Head to the back room of Xen Shadow HQ. Use Madelis' key to take the
    train to the hidden lab.
5.  Talk to the machine, and present your Metal Powder, 3 Cell
    Batteries, and Poke Ball to obtain **Ralts**!
6.  Exit out the door at the bottom, then head down to Mudkip. While
    you're here, pick up a *Damp Rock* and a *Fighting Memory*, and a
    hidden *Star Piece* to the south.
7.  Surf up from here, and enter Xen Lab from its left side. The door is
    sorta hard to see. Then exit to the south. Surf across and to the
    right, and you can battle/catch **Mudkip**!

We also now have Magma Drift, so there are a few places we can go. Buy a Spice Powder from the jungle if you don't have one yet, and head to Sheridan, enter Carotos. Rock Smash the rock to the left and drift to the left. Grab *TM36 Sludge Bomb*! Head back to the right and drift across here. Clear this maze and grab the *Rare Candy* as well as the **Cyndaquil** egg.

Enter the next room and make your way to Madelis' palace. Head down to the corrupted cave area. Magma Drift here and follow the path to a *Poison Barb*. Back on land, continue following the path to the southeast and you'll find another spot to Magma Drift on the right. Hidden along it is another *Poison Barb*. Follow the path to catch **Aevian Paras**!

This is all we can do for now, so when you're ready, head back to Teila Resort and enter the dance hall.

Talk to Reina in here to get a *Dusk Stone* and *Exp. Candy M*. You can also battle her. Talk to the girl at the top. She'll tell us about building hype. Do whatever you have to do to build the hype - talk to people, battle trainers, change the song with the guy on the right.

After building some hype, an Audino trainer will appear. She uses level 55's, so you should be able to grind your team up if need be. You'll get 7 *Exp. Candy M* when you win.

Once you've hyped to the max, head into the battlefield.

Fever Pitch: Fire \| Special \| 70, 100, or 130 power depending on Hype level \| 100% accuracy \| Can be used even when asleep, and wakes up all sleeping Pokemon on the field \| On Volcanic Top Field, power is boosted x1.2 and triggers an eruption \| Two uses transforms Cave Field into Volcanic Field.

Relationship Points are granted based on the conditions under which you end this battle:
-   End the battle on Snowy Mountain field (-2 Amber)
-   End the battle with \<300 Hype (-4 Amber)
-   End the battle with \>= 300 Hype (+3 Amber)

Anyways, this battle isn't super tough, but it can still be tricky. Her Toxtricity can hit hard once it boosts its Sp. Atk. with Throat Spray, and Chandelure hits hard as always. Speed Boost Blaziken can also be threatening. As Jan says, if you can change the field, you'll be golden. Mountain Field, Icy Mountain, Water Surface, Underwater can all be useful fields you can use against her in a chain. You can also turn it to Sky Field with a single use of Bounce! Even if you don't, a good Earthquake user or two with something to take out the Air Balloons can do a number on her team.

Win to get the Lyric Badge, which lets us hit Level 60, and *TM50 Overheat*! Head outside and watch the cutscene.
