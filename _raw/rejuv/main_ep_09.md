Talk to Amber outside the gym once you leave, then meet her in her room. Talk to her and say "they all died" for relationship points.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Probably. (Amber -1)
- They all died. (Amber +3)

Then head up into the Poke Ball storage room. Accept Venam's fast travel request. Talk to her and Augustus, answering her question. If you answer "A forest," you'll have a chance for some relationship points with her in a bit. Accept the fast travel again, then enter Valor Mountain 5F.

**Relationship Point Choices** (Answered "A Forest" only):
- Intuition. (Venam +2)

Surf to the right, then rock climb down to get *TM40 Aerial Ace!*

Talk to Venam and Melia.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's okay! (Venam +3, Melia +3)
- Sorta awkward. (Neutral)

So begins Rejuvenations next major twist... time travel!

There is a hidden *Aguav Berry,* 2 *Soda Pops,* and *Protein.* Save this Protein for a quest later! Grab the *Full Heal* at the top.

Head up to Ambrette Town and enter the upper left estate. Head upstairs. Talk to the box to change clothes, but you can change back at any time. There is also a PC and bed to heal in the upper left room. Talk to Melia in the upper right corner.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Beautiful! (Melia +2)
- Stylish! (Melia +2)
- It's alright. (Melia +1)
- Yikes. (Melia -2)

Then sit in the open chair around the table downstairs to play through the scene. Then, talk to Irvin and the gang in the lab.

Head to Kugearen City afterwards. Enter the cafe in the bottom.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It was excellent! (Venam +2)
- It was alright. (Venam -1)
- Awful. (Venam +2)

You'll have to choose a Pokemon to battle Kanon, but you don't need to win this one. Well, head out, and talk to Venam in the square. Head east.

Kugearen Woods (Past)

| Grass        | %        | Headbutt        | %        |

| Ursaring     | 1        |                 |          |

Head into a forest a bit and you'll have to fend off a wild Shiftry. Down and to the right from here is 4 *Rawst Berries* and a hidden *Zinc.* Head up into Marble Garden.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yeah! (Venam +2)
- Nah. (Venam -1)

Enter the house and after a scene, you'll be free to explore. Talk to Anathea in the garden for a optional scene.

Exit to the woods.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's do this. (Venam +4)
- What about Melia? (Neutral)
- I dunno... (Venam -2)

Head back to the city and enter the house in the bottom right of town. Head up.

Enter Blakeory Co. in the southwest. After the meeting, enter the forest again. Head south to follow the policeman.

Go to the northeast for a *Rare Candy* and a *Leppa Berry.* Hidden nearby is *Honey.* On your way to the south, you'll get 2 *Cheri Berries, Revive,* 2 *Oran Berries,* and 2 *Aspear Berries* at the very top. Eavesdrop on the conversation: you'll have to fight Gardevoir!

Angel of Death Gardevoir (No Field)
-   Dark Gardevoir, Level 60. @ Lum Berry. Ability: Pixilate. Types:
    Dark/Fairy. Stats: 88/65/135/165/135/100. 3 Shields.
    -   Psyshock
    -   Hyper Voice
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Focus Blast

This version hits pretty hard, but luckily isn't too tough to take it out if you target its weaknesses or use Trick Room.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Worried? (Venam +2)
- Scared? (Venam -2)
- Taking too long to find me? (Venam +3)

Grab the shiny *Apartment Key.*

This isn't strictly necessary but helps us save some Pokemon later. Head back to Kugearen and use the key on the door in the top left of the area. Head down and read the book on the table. After that, head to the right and read this book to get the *Weird Diary.*

Talk to Venam by Katsu's house, then return to the mansion. Beat the first maid, then beat the second sitting on the bench. Next to her you can get a hidden *Silk Scarf!* Interact with the statues in the four rooms up and down from the garden: top left facing right, top right facing down, bottom right facing left, bottom left facing up. Head upstairs and enter the newly opened door. Grab the **Indeedee** here!

Talk to the portrait in this room to begin a puzzle.

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image54.png"/>

This is what it should look like when completed. Enter the door downstairs and go down.

Head down and follow the prompts. Choose whether to save the Officer, or to save Maria. Attempting to save Maria grants (+4 Anathea Relationship Points), but saving the policeman actually works and may affect future versions. It also makes Gardevoir hate you particularly more. Either head down to untie the officer, or up to save Maria.

If you chose the officer, you could choose to refuse all Gardevoir's requests or not. Refusing them will save the officer.

Anyways, after the scene, head outside into the forest, and then to Kugearen City. Pick North or West, but watch the scene play out. Then pick Blakeory Co. Beat the maid.

Talk to Melia in the kitchen to get some sleep. After a bunch of scenes, it's time for a quick battle!

Gang Leader Karrina (No Field)
-   Runerigus, Level 54. @ Red Card.
    -   Earthquake
    -   Shadow Claw
    -   Body Press
    -   Toxic Spikes
-   Musharna, Level 54. @ Zoom Lens.
    -   Energy Ball
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Psyshock
    -   Hypnosis
-   Granbull, Level 55. @ Babiri Berry.
    -   Play Rough
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Earthquake
-   Alakazam, Level 55. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Substitute
    -   Psyshock
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Shadow Ball
-   Nidoking, Level 56. @ Expert Belt.
    -   Earth Power
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Poison Jab
    -   Flamethrower

This battle can be kind of tough, she has some strong Pokemon! That said it's a 6v5 on no field so you should be able to win somehow.

Enter the new grove to return to the past for now. We can use this crystal to go back to the past whenever we want.

## West Gearen City Sewers

Talk to Venam to board the boat. While onboard, say "About a 10" for relationship points.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- About a 5. (Neutral)
- About a 3. (Neutral)
- About a 7. (Venam +1)
- About a 10. (Venam +2, Melia +1)

After a lot of talking, head down and follow the path. After more talking, head out to the left then try to enter the gate at the bottom. Enter the room above and to the left and talk to the machine.

Head down and go through the path. Pick up *TM84 Poison Jab.* Change the water level down from here, then head up and grab the *PP Up.* Enter the door.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Bye. (Erick -2)
- We're here to help! (Erick +2)

Grab *TM129 Fake Tears.*

Head through the gate to downstairs.

WG Sewage Management (Factory Field)

| Grass        | %        |
|--------------|----------|
| Salandit     | 34       |
| Trubbish     | 30       |
| Grimer       | 15       |
| Oddish       | 10       |
| **Toxel**    | 6        |
| Koffing      | 5        |
| Grimer       | 5        |

Toxel is our next target for Zumi's quest. Grab the *Hyper Potion* in here. Head up, then grab the Rift dex entry for Code: Corroso here.

After heading up, show Erick the Weird Diary if you want to save Garbodor.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Let's save Garbodor! (Venam +4, Melia +4)
- Ugh... Why me? (Melia -4, Venam -4, Erick -4)
- How about tomorrow? (Erick +1)

Dimensional Rift Garbodor (Corrupted Cave Field)
-   Garbodor, Level 65. @ Black Sludge. 3 Shields. Type: Poison/Dark.
    Stats: 120/80/190/120/190/10. Ability: Poison Heal.
    -   Sludge Wave
    -   Giga Drain
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Recover

This thing can be tough to take out because on this field, even after destroying all 3 shields, it manages to heal 25% of its health every turn with Black Sludge. Plus, it's Sludge Wave is boosted immensely and given Rock sub-typing. That said, with strong moves and Melia's team as support it isn't too difficult to wear it down. Alternatively, switch the field to Volcanic by using Heat Wave, Eruption, or Lava Plume, or, to Mountain field via Sky Uppercut.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're on! (Erick +2)
- Gotta go... (Erick -2)

Once we regain control, head back down into the sewers, where we can now get:

You can find a hidden *Mystery Bowl* in the skinny ledge on the east overlooking the sea.

Head outside and enter the power plant. In the door to the left, head up. Pick up the *Metal Coat* here. Head down the stairs: for a quest, gather 5 Electric types, and 5 Fire types to donate. The easiest way to do this is to breed a mon of each type and take all their babies back. Return to each person with the 5 Pokemon to get the *Electirizer* and *Magmarizer.* Pick up 2 *Cell Batteries* next to the Electrodes.

Outside the power plant to the left, you'll find a *Data Drive.*

To the west, though it is super tricky to spot, grab:

ZCell 054: West Gearen City

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image56.png"/>

Use your Itemfinder south of the pool to find a *Rose Incense.*

Head south into the city proper.

There's a woman selling *Blast Powder* for $25000. It's pretty expensive and unnecessary to get it here.

ZCell 055: West Gearen City

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image57.png"/>

Use your Itemfinder all around the city. You'll find a *Telluric Seed, Yellow Shard, Max Repel, Dusk Stone, Float Stone, Green Shard, Zinc, Muscle Wing, Max Repel, Red Shard, GourmetTreat.*

Cut the upper left tree to get *TM21 Frustration!*

Enter Gearen News HQ. In the bottom left you'll find a *Hyper Potion.* Also, there's a Level 60 Audino trainer here if you need, win to get 5 *Exp. Candy L*, each time you win. Very handy for grinding! Grab the *Wide Lens* in the upper right.

Enter the door to the right of the one with the red door in the bottom right of the city. A guy will trade you *Protective Pads* for three Absorb Bulbs.

Enter the red door with the sign to the left and up.

WG Rare Fossil Shop

|Item          |Price |
|--------------|------|
|*Old Amber*   |$75000|
|*Cover Fossil*|$75000|

Head outside and enter the Junction Bridge from the left.

ZCell 056: Junction Bridge

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image58.png"/>

Speaking of Zygarde Cells, exit Junction Bridge to the right and go talk to Ayuda, who'll give us the *Macho Brace* for finding at least 45. Our next mission is for 70.

A couple shops have new wares:

Berry Emporium New Item (8 Badges)

|Item        |Price|
|------------|-----|
|*Occa Berry*|$750 |

Buy a bunch of Occa Berries now for much later.

Next, return to the Magnolia Library and show Zumi your Pokedex with Toxel inside. She'll give us 15 *Exp. Candy M,* as well as tell you a hint about one way to evolve it.

Return to the help center in West Gearen.

## West Gearen City Help Quests

### HQuest 23: Generator Problems  You can only do this quest if you have freed Dufaux.

Start at the power plant on the north side and talk to Gabriel. Head inside to see what's happened.

Carefully sneak to the left and into the generator room. Save and use F12 if you get spotted to reduce the backtracking.

Make your way to the generator room and watch all the events unfold. Narcissa will leave for Goldenleaf Town.
   Claim your reward: $3500. Also, bring a Nosepass or a Magneton to the generator room and they will evolve! This room also houses  *TM64 Explosion* and the *Electric Memory.*

### HQuest 24: House Sit Start at Saki's house west of the power plant. Talk to Erina. Read the  note on the table. Do 3 of the actions, then head upstairs.

Defeat the AA Grunts, then do three more actions.

Head upstairs and into Saki's room on the right. Read the diary at the bottom. Re-enter the house, and head up and right.

Claim your reward: $5500.

### HQuest 25: Hidden Library 3 Start at the park and enter the hidden library.

Head all the way up and to the back. Talk to Karen, then attempt to press the pillar switch. Talk to Karrina outside the door, then head into the southeast room. Head downstairs and grab *TM77 Psych Up.*

Welcome to the Unown Dimension. Grab the *Max Repel* at the top.

Unown Dimension

| Grass        | %        |
|--------------|----------|
| Unown        | 55       |
| Hoothoot     | 20       |
| Pidgey       | 10       |
| Noctowl      | 10       |
| Pidgeotto    | 5        |

Head inside and talk to Alice and Allen.

Enter the forest to the east. Fight the grunts. In general, I recommend Special Attack -\> Fierce Attack spam. If you lose you can just redo, anyways.

Grab the *Carbos* on the right side and the *Rare Candy* below the ledge. Grab the *Hyper Potion* up above. Return to the house, then head back through the forest to the cave at the north side.

Solve the tile puzzle. It's the same Kabuto one as in HGSS.

Head back to the two-person door. Push the lever and enter. Pick left to get MegaStone: *Banettite* and right to get MegaStone: *Heracronite.* Again, we can't yet use these, but good to have.

Return to grab $4000.

As a reward for finishing all the quests, you'll get a **Turtwig** egg!
(+1 Karma)

### Spector Battle Quest

Now, head to the Wispy Ruins via Wispy Tower area entrance. Take the right vines down and enter the 8-badge gate to the right. Take the *Elemental Seed* in the chest.

1.  Talk to Spector in front of the Giratina statue in town
2.  Head into Wispy Tower. Talk to Spector in here.
3.  Head into the Lost Castle to talk to Spector in the upper room.
4.  Head into Narcissa's gym. Head through the backstage theatre as
    normal and talk to Spector when you see him.
5.  Finally, meet him in the gym auditorium for a battle!

Gym Leader Spector (Haunted Field)
-   Murkrow, Level 60. @ Eviolite.
    -   Perish Song
    -   Night Shade
    -   Roost
    -   Protect
-   Gothitelle, Level 60. @ Kasib Berry.
    -   Fake Out
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Protect
    -   Psychic
-   Gengar, Level 61. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Perish Song
    -   Mean Look
    -   Spectral Scream
-   Cursola, Level 61. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Strength Sap
    -   Hex
    -   Protect
    -   Whirlpool
-   Ninetales, Level 62. @ Magical Seed.
    -   Protect
    -   Fire Spin
    -   Ominous Wind
    -   Hypnosis
-   Banette, Level 63. @ Banettite.
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Destiny Bond
    -   Protect
    -   Shadow Claw

This is a very tricky battle! He doesn't focus on raw strength;
his Mega Banette is really his only strong Pokemon. Instead, he will try to wear you down. The initial duo of Murkrow and Gothitelle forces you to stay in and stick around for a Perish Song unless you can knock out Gothitelle in the first three turns of the battle. Luckily Gothitelle will usually go for Fake Out on turn one, so one of your Pokemon will likely get in at least one hit. Once you deal with the first pair, Ninetales is particularly annoying because of its speed and increased accuracy on Hypnosis, paired with Mega Banette to knock you out, this is deadly. All in all, a tricky fight, but you can get around the specific sleep + perish song-oriented strategies with Safeguard, Taunt, and other similar moves if you must.

Win to get the *Ghost Memory!*

## Route 4 Eight Badge Update

Next is a quick detour to Route 4 to get some new Den Pokemon - feel free to skip this one.

Essentially, now that we've beaten Amber, all four of the dens we've seen so far have been updated with new Pokemon! So, I will list the Pokemon in each here.

RIFT DEN 1 (8 - 12 Badges): The common encounters in this den are Graveler, Nuzleaf, **Duosion**, Solosis, Tropius, **Sigilyph**, and **Dhelmise**. The rare ones are **Relicanth, Persian**, Lumineon, Bonsly.

RIFT DEN 2 (8 - 12 Badges): The common encounters in this den are Unfezant, Wailmer, Dunsparce, Vullaby, Masquerain, Quagsire. The rare ones are Chatot, Snorunt, **Glalie**, Cacnea, **Cacturne**, Claydol.

RIFT DEN 3 (8 - 12 Badges): The common encounters in this den are **Stoutland**, Crabrawler, Pachirisu, Chimecho, Stunfisk, **Abra**. The rare ones are **Rhydon**, **Vanilluxe**, Vanillish, Purugly, **Ditto**, Teddiursa.

RIFT DEN 4 (8 - 12 Badges): The common encounters in this den are Lombre, Gastrodon, **Seismitoad**. The rare ones are Mantyke, Mantine, **Jellicent**.

Entering Cairo's house, he has more available crests now!

Cairo's Shop New Items (8 Badges)

|Item             |Price            |

|*Druddigon Crest*|5000 Red Essences|
|*Thievul Crest*  |5000 Red Essences|

Now that we have Ditto, head over to Sheridan Village, and use it to breed the Throh we got earlier. In the daycare, talk to the girl and trade your spare to her to get **Sawk!**

That's all we can do right now. Head back to Erick's gym and head up to challenge him.

## Pulse Badge

Head outside. Enter the factory here. Attempt to enter the door to the right, and you'll fight:

League Scout Amanda (Factory Field)
-   Incineroar, Level 57. @ Assault Vest.
    -   Flare Blitz
    -   Fake Out
    -   Darkest Lariat
    -   U-Turn
-   Hatterene, Level 60. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Psychic
    -   Mystical Fire
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Trick Room
-   Druddigon, Level 58. @ Druddigon Crest.
    -   Dragon Claw
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Sucker Punch
    -   Gunk Shot
-   Torkoal, Level 58. @ Heat Rock.
    -   Eruption
    -   Heave Wave
    -   Solarbeam
    -   Earth Power
-   Bronzong, Level 59. @ Occa Berry.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Gyro Ball
    -   Trick Room
    -   Sunny Day
-   Miltank, Level 58. @ Chople Berry.
    -   Return
    -   Milk Drink
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Hammer Arm

The good news is the field doesn't really do anything for her team in this battle, so if you can exploit Factory Field for your own benefit, go ahead. The bad news is her team is particularly good at what it does overall and includes the first crest we must fight: Druddigon's. Crest details are listed in the appendix below. You'll notice that Trick Room is the central strategy she employs here: you can take advantage of that and bring in your own heavy hitting slow team or prevent it from being used. One strategy is to open with Pokemon immune to the Fake Out from Incineroar in some way, another is to have a Multi-hit move strong enough to ORKO Hatterene, and so on. If you can succeed and make sure Bronzong similarly goes down before it can use Trick Room, you will have an easy time here.

Head up for the gym battle!

Electrical Engineer Erick (Murkwater Field)
-   Electivire, Level 60. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Thunder Raid
    -   Ice Punch

    -   Thunder Raid
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Overdrive
    -   Hidden Power Ice

Thunder Raid: Electric \| Physical \| 3-hit move, hits are 20, 40, and 60 power \| 100% accuracy \| On Murkwater Surface Field, power is boosted x1.5.

I'm not saying Amanda is harder than this fight but... it's close. He does have some threats, particularly Mega Toxtricity, whose field boosted Overdrive that hits both of your Pokemon might just knock them entirely off the map. Raichu's ability is always activated so it will surely outspeed you. Other than that, though nothing goes too crazy on the offensive side if you can manage it right. Note that on this field all Ground moves fail, so you'll likely need to try a different strategy to succeed here than sheer super effective move overload.

Even though there's no mountain in sight, physically, if you use Blizzard -\> Sky Uppercut here, you can turn the field into Snowy Mountain, allowing your Rock Sliders to go crazy. Or consider using just the Icy Field and letting Blizzard users go off. You can also take Snowy Mountain even further by turning it into a Mountain, then a Cave, then a Volcano... So, there are many possibilities here.

Even without messing with the field, you can do a lot with Ground types and other electric types.

Win to get the Pulse Badge, up to level 65 Pokemon, and *TM72 Volt Switch.*
