# Chapter 1: Shipwrecked

## Prologue

To start, the "M" key toggles a speed-up of the game. The game will start off asking if you want to skip the prologue. Rejuvenation is a very story-focused game, so I recommend viewing it if it is your first time playing. If you do skip the prologue, jump ahead to the next section.

As soon as you're done reading the Zorua and Pangoro story, take control of Maria and head downstairs to talk to Mom. Afterwards enter the bottom room on the left side of the first floor and head downstairs and interact with the summoning table.

Head back upstairs and talk to Dad in the top-left room. Then return to the kitchen to talk to Mom. After that go upstairs. After a brief flash and the sound of breaking glass, go back downstairs and talk with the mysterious figure. Head west back down to the basement to watch the cutscene.

After regaining control of Marianette, head down, east, and up through the hallway and watch the final cutscene of the prologue play out.

## S.S. Oceana

After either skipping the prologue or finishing the last cutscene, the game asks which difficulty mode you'd prefer. Personally, I would recommend Casual Mode for anyone attempting to do a more restrictive challenge run or anyone who does not have much experience with the Reborn-style Pokemon game. I would recommend Normal Mode to anyone looking for a challenge or who found Reborn's difficulty adequate, and Intense Mode to those with lots of experience who found Normal / Reborn too easy, somehow. Regardless of choice, the game allows you to change your difficulty setting later if you want. **I will be covering battles in this guide as they appear in Normal Mode.**

Register yourself as a trainer, choosing among genders and six sprites.

Amanda will ask if you want to input a password. I don't recommend using the password if you've never played the game, since this section contains many important story beats, but if you do want to skip ahead to the next section, the password is 4567, though you'll lose out on potential relationship points with Nancy.

There are two other passwords you can input here. If you want to play as a legacy protagonist sprite, type 1111. If you want to play the game as a certain side quest character from later (Ana), type 9494.

Exit the first room and talk to Nancy. This is the first of instances that get you relationship points with characters, which affect how they view you. Thanks to Punch for collecting the information about these.

Any dialogue options which are not listed do not affect relationship points. (Search "Relationship Point" to see them all)

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'm fine. (Mom +2)
- ... (Mom -1)

Once you've talked to Nancy and can roam, explore the S.S. Oceana. In this game talking to everyone and everything you see can be vital to discovering new Pokemon and Items, so it's a good idea to talk to everyone aboard.

Heading to the stairs on the left, in the two rooms you can enter on the left side, there are two notches in the wall. Interacting with them, you can listen in on two conversations: one with unknown figures and the other including Nancy.

Head up the stairs three times to the right to talk to Cpt. Augustus. He'll explain a few of Rejuvenation's mechanics. Head downstairs and enter the double doors to the upper middle room. Talk to Nancy to get the banquet started, when you're ready.

Once you regain control, follow the path and watch the events play out.

## Oceana Pier

After either skipping the boat scenes or watching the cutscenes, talk to Tesla. Once you regain control, you can explore Oceana Pier.

Now is a good time to change some of your options. I recommend doing Text Speed Max and Battle Scene Off if you want the game to go quickly. For a bit more challenge, you can also change the battle mode to "Set." I also recommend storing at least a few backups -- save files can get corrupted.

Anyways, if you want to talk to the woman on the northeast pier, you can get an all-expenses paid trip to Hoenn, but it is a game over. Otherwise, there's not too much to do here yet, so head into the gate on the north side.

## Gearen Laboratory

The trainers won't let you head west or east quite yet, so head into the building north.

The guy running in place on the left will offer to give you cinematic bars during important cutscenes if you want. Talk to the girl behind the counter to buy some basic products.

Gearen Lab Shop

|Item       |Price  |
|-----------|-------|
|*Poke Ball*|$200   |
|*Potion*   |$300   |
|*Repel*    |$350   |
|*Antidote* |$100   |

You start with $1500. I recommend picking up at least a few Poke balls to catch some team members soon, as a full team is almost necessary to succeed in Rejuvenation, even as early as the first gym battle of this game.

Talk to Amanda at the top of the building to see a brief cutscene, then head up towards the door to meet Melia. Go through the door to meet Professor Jenner. You'll then get to pick a starter Pokemon by interacting with it. If you talk to the rainbow-colored machine on the right side, it will randomly choose for you among the 24 starters.

Starter Choices (Pick ONE)
- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**
- **Grookey**
- **Scorbunny**
- **Sobble**

As in Reborn, Speed Boost Torchic is arguably the strongest choice, but all the starters can be useful in their own ways. The first gym specializes in Poison, so the Grass-type starters may be difficult to  use at first. Choose whatever you want though!

You can quick save with 'D' in front of the Pokemon you choose and use
'F12' to soft reset for natures, IV's, shininess, and abilities. All Pokemon in this game have a chance at hidden abilities and the shiny rate is increased to a little over 1/100.

Anyways, once you've picked your starter, head west for a battle with Aevium Scout Amanda! You can win or lose this battle.

League Scout Amanda (No Field)
-   Hatenna, Level 5.
    -   Tackle
    -   Play Nice

Note that in this game you can press "S" to check the stats of all the Pokemon, as well as the weather / field / move effects in play to aid you in your fights. After the battle, she'll give you *5 Poke Balls.*

Head to talk to Jenner and you'll fight:

Pokemon Trainer Ren (No Field)
-   Froakie, Level 5.
    -   Pound
    -   Growl

After the fight with Ren, Jenner asks you to visit Route 1 to help Melia. He then gives you the *Pokedex* and the *Cybernav!* Head back downstairs and listen to Jan's tutorial.

The EV training center can be accessed by talking to the woman on the right of the counter, but none of its training rooms are open right now.

When you're ready, head back outside to start exploring East Gearen City!

## Left East Gearen City

This guide will not cover every NPC trainer, but know that as you explore Aevium there are many!

Patches of grass around Gearen City have opened, so consider catching some Pokemon to assist your starter.

Left East Gearen City

| Grass: Morning        | %    |Grass: Day     | %    | Grass: Night         | %    |
|-----------------------|------|---------------|------|----------------------|------|
| **Rattata (Alolan)**  | 30   | **Bidoof**    | 30   | **Rattata (Alolan)** | 30   |
| **Wurmple**           | 25   | **Wurmple**   | 25   | **Wurmple**          | 25   |
| **Pidgey**            | 15   | **Pidove**    | 15   | **Poochyena**        | 15   |
| **Patrat**            | 15   | **Patrat**    | 15   | **Hoothoot**         | 15   |
| **Bellsprout**        | 10   | **Bellsprout**| 10   | **Oddish**           | 10   |
| **Sunkern**           | 5    | **Sunkern**   | 5    | **Chingling**        | 5    |

Chingling can help in the fight against the gym dramatically, especially if you manage to evolve it. However, it is rare-ish here and can be found much more reliably later.

If you go west on the bottom street, you can find a GourmetTreat in a bush. We'll want some of these later to get event Pokemon.

If you talk to the nerd on the east side of the bottom street, he'll give you *Reverse Candy.* The tile to the left of the rightmost tree on this street has a hidden *Oran Berry* in it. Another *Oran Berry* can be found immediately below the machine thing on the right street, above Lacey.

If you go up to the north, left, and down, you can find an *Elemental Seed* one tile above the left of two trees. There is also a *Resist Wing* in the grass four spaces to the right.

Heading up to the park, you can find a *Grass Gem* one tile left of the rightmost bench in the park. Sneaking around the wall to the right, there is a *Blue Shard* in the side of the building, and on the other side, an *Escape Rope* in the wall. The tile one down and one right from the bottom right edge of the fountain has another *Grass Gem*, and straight to the left the third tile from the edge of the park holds a *Super Repel.*

You can find a *GourmetTreat* in the wall between two dumpsters on the north side of the city up one set of stairs, and *Yellow Shard* on the ground between the two dumpsters to the left of those. Another *Yellow Shard* is in the rightmost dumpster up another set of stairs.

Head out to the Oceana Pier. You'll find a **Nidoran M** eating. Talk to it with a GourmetTreat for a battle.

The garden to the south is also now open, so you can catch level 5 **Fletchling** here by interacting with them. If you're interested in winning even the "impossible" story battles, make sure you catch two, for their Quick Guard move will help us win one later. The bottom right grass tile here has a *Sweet Heart,* and there is an *X Accuracy* two tiles left and one up from there.

Head into the building on the west side that's now unlocked. Talk to the "man" with the yellow hair, then exit the building and watch Buizel run by. This starts a quest we'll complete later.

Back in East Gearen, to the left of the lab is the Velvet Building. In each of the buildings, people will challenge you to battles, so be warned. Head up to the first floor and talk to the woman in the middle. If you choose left, she'll give you a *Mineral Ball,* and *Steam Ball* if you choose right. Also grab the *Great Ball* in the bottom left. If you enter the second floor, you'll see a **Pachirisu** running wild. If you give it a GourmetTreat, it'll battle you. There is also a *Potion* in the corner. Grab the *Exp. Candy XS* on the third floor.

Now go to the Emerald Building on the northeast side of town. Talk to a girl on the left side to learn about the mystery of the third floor. You'll need to beat a trainer to access the upper levels. On the second floor pick up a *Red Shard* in the corner. Talk to a red-haired girl for a *Full Heal*, and get a *Super Repel* from an old woman. Enter the third floor to battle a level 5 **Shuppet**.

If you enter the Magnolia Library on the north side of town and pay $300 you can enter the back side of the library. By talking to the man in glasses you can use the shards hidden around the map for tutor moves. These aren't very useful, but you can get them for your Pokemon if you want to.

Library Move Tutor

|Move           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|Bind           |1 Red Shard    |
|Covet          |1 Blue Shard   |
|Helping Hand   |1 Yellow Shard |

The building on the left of the library is the Gearen Help Center. We'll be returning here later.

After doing all this you may be strong enough to complete the final quest of this area for now. If you try to cross into the northwest side of the city, a thug will force you to pay $300 or to battle him.

He uses two Level 12-13 Pokemon, so be sure you're ready. When you win you can access the northwest area! (+1 Karma, a way for the game to track how much you help people)

Two tiles up and two tiles right of the grandma on the bench is a hidden *Red Shard.* Three down and three left of the cop in the top left is a *Super Potion.*

You can interact with a Nidoran in this map. Follow it to these locations:

1. First encounter -- northeast by Emerald building.
2. Northwest by train station.
3. East side of the city near bridge, next to dumpster.
4. North side, south of library near some dumpsters.

After this encounter you can interact with it and battle it. **Nidoran F** is at level 5.

## Right East Gearen City

You'll see grass around this part of the city too, with more Pokemon.

Right East Gearen City

| Grass: Morning    | %    | Grass: Day    | %    | Grass: Night    | %    |
|-------------------|------|---------------|------|-----------------|------|
| Rattata (Alolan)  | 30   | Bidoof        | 30   | Rattata (Alolan)| 30   |
| **Paras**         | 28   | **Paras**     | 28   | **Jigglypuff**  | 28   |
| Patrat            | 25   | Patrat        | 25   | Poochyena       | 25   |
| Pidgey            | 15   | Pidove        | 15   | Hoothoot        | 15   |
| **Klink**         | 2    | **Klink**     | 2    | **Klink**       | 2    |

Catch a Female Jigglypuff to breed later.

Heading straight up from the entrance, to the left of the machine in the grass is a hidden *Super Repel,* and the bottom right tile in this grassy area contains a *Poke Ball.* The bush to the right has a hidden *Resist Wing.*

To the east, you'll see a *Super Potion* near a tent. Here you'll meet Mr. Luck -- this is how you change your difficulty, as I mentioned earlier.

Down and to the left is a machine, one tile up there is a hidden *Potion.*

The center of the map has a row of shops. I usually sell the Resist Wings here to get some cash. Here's where you get more GourmetTreats if you run out. We aren't going to need any Reverse Candies in this game beyond the ones we find since the level cap is a hard cap unless you use Rare Candies to go over it.

East Gearen Market Shop: Top-left

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Poke Ball*    |$200   |
|*Potion*       |$300   |
|*GourmetTreat* |$1500  |
|*Repel*        |$350   |
|*Reverse Candy*|$50    |

East Gearen Market Shop: Bottom-left

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Ice Heal*     |$250       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Awakening*    |$250       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |


Only during the daytime on weekdays there is one more vendor:

East Gearen Market Shop: Bottom-right

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Reverse Candy*|$50        |
|*Soda Pop*     |$300       |

If you talk to the vendor on the top right, he'll attempt to sell you Poke Ball's at $400 each. While this may seem like a rip-off, once you buy four, he'll give you a **Voltorb!**

If you enter the Shopping Emporium above the market vendors, there are a few shops open for business.

Berry Emporium Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Oran Berry*   |$200       |
|*Pecha Berry*  |$300       |

You can pick up a few of each berry for the gym.

Poke Ball Emporium Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Heavy Ball*   |$300       |
|*Moon Ball*    |$300       |

The Heavy Ball won't be too useful for the beginning portion of the game. If you haven't captured Jigglypuff or done the Nidoran events,Moon Balls can be extra useful, but the cheaper, normal balls also work fine. The right vendor is currently not in business due to an unfulfilled help quest, which we'll get to later.

Heading down a street, three tiles east and one down from the bicycle shop door you'll find a *Pretty Wing.* In a park to the right, two tiles left of a skinny tree is a hidden *Repel.* Heading east from here, in the upper right patch in the grass under some train tracks you'll find an *Antidote,* and five tiles to the east of the corner of blue liquid below you, in the street, is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

On the southeast point of the city, if you go west past Karrina, you can find a *Reverse Candy* hiding in the shade of the tree.

Along the east side of the city, you should see Buizel. His trainer will show up. Win the battle, and **Buizel** is yours!

North from here, grab an *Iron.* Again, I recommend selling it as $4900 is a lot of money at this point in the game. Down and left from here, from the bottom end of the blue liquid, five tiles left is a hidden *Revive.*

Go up towards the Chrisola Resort in the northeast corner of town. Head east as you get up the stairs and follow the path to get *TM83: Infestation.* The two flower pots on either side of the door have hidden *Paralyze Heal* and *Green Shard.*

## Chrisola Resort

Enter the Chrisola Hotel Resort at the top of the map. Entering gives us a Relationship Point (Saki +1).

After you regain control, talk to a man in the bottom right for a *Super Potion.* Enter the right hallway. In one room you can get *TM126 Whirlpool.* In the hallway on the left, head into the open room at the top and interact with the tile down and right from the top left plant for $1500!

Head to the Casino level and talk to the red-haired fellow. They'll flush their Coin Case down the drain so we can pick it up later.

You've probably noticed a few popups regarding achievements thus far. Complete them and you'll earn AP, redeemable here. For now, we probably can't get much but I recommend saving up for the HM Items as they'll make your life a lot easier. The card items will allow you access to EV Training rooms in Jenner's lab, so those are nice too. The Exp. All isn't that necessary anymore in this game since there are lots of grinding options available. Anyways, talk to the girl on the right side to get an *Achievement Card.*

AP Shop

|Item                   |Price  |
|-----------------------|-------|
|*Adamant Mint*         |3 AP   |
|*Jolly Mint*           |3 AP   |
|*Brave Mint*           |3 AP   |
|*Timid Mint*           |3 AP   |
|*Modest Mint*          |3 AP   |
|*Quiet Mint*           |3 AP   |
|*Calm Mint*            |3 AP   |
|*Bold Mint*            |3 AP   |
|*PP Up*                |6 AP   |
|*Golden Axe*           |10 AP  |
|*Golden Hammer*        |10 AP  |
|*Golden Surfboard*     |15 AP  |
|*Golden Gauntlet*      |15 AP  |
|*Golden Scuba Gear*    |15 AP  |
|*Golden Wings*         |20 AP  |
|*Golden Jetpack*       |20 AP  |
|*Golden Drift Board*   |20 AP  |
|*Golden Claws*         |20 AP  |
|*Exp. All*             |30 AP  |
|*HP Card*              |10 AP  |
|*Atk Card*             |10 AP  |
|*Def Card*             |10 AP  |
|*Speed Card*           |10 AP  |
|*Sp. Atk Card*         |10 AP  |
|*Sp. Def Card*         |10 AP  |

I wouldn't recommend buying any of the first nine items until you get everything else. Golden Items allow us to use HMs without needing a Pokemon in the party that has learned them. The Cards allow us to access EV training rooms. Exp. All is very helpful for grinding, but with the grinders and Exp. Candies, it may not be the most useful thing for its high price yet. The cards let you into the basement of the Gearen lab to do rapid EV training. When you do get access to each EV room, inside you'll find the respective Power item: *Power Anklet, Power Band, Power Belt, Power Bracer, Power Lens, Power Weight.*

When I play, I tend to buy the Golden Hammer first, then begin collecting the Cards. I'll buy the Golden Axe as soon as I get Cut, then finish with AP cards. Then I'll buy the rest of the Golden Items as I need them, and the Exp. All when I have enough AP.

Head up to the top floor of the building, Rooftop. There is an Audino breeder up here: every time you beat them, you will get 3 *Exp. Candy S.* Combined with the hard level cap, these breeders make level management in this game a breeze!

Three tiles down and two to the right from the lamppost two to the left of the breeder is a hidden *Oran Berry.* Two lampposts down from the breeder, there is a hidden *Resist Wing* four tiles right and one up. Finally, from the right set of stairs to the helipad two tiles down and one right has a hidden *Reverse Candy.*

There are Pokemon to encounter here.

Chrisola Rooftop

| Grass: Morning/Day| %    | Grass: Night    | %        |
|-------------------|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Skitty**        | 44   | **Purrloin**    | 44       |
| **Glameow**       | 24   | **Meowth**      | 24       |
| **Caterpie**      | 20   | **Weedle**      | 20       |
| **Meowth**        | 10   | **Glameow**     | 10       |
| Bellsprout        | 2    | Oddish          | 2        |

Once you're done, head back outside. Enter the Aqua Building to the southwest. On the first floor, pick up the *Old Rod*, as well as another *Iron*! If you attempt to go to the third floor, you'll enter a really impossible battle (Level 80!) given the tools we have now. I don't recommend this unless you have the money and self-respect to spare.

## Gearen Park

Head to the bottom part of this area.

You can find a *Heart Scale* in the wall between two trees on the left. Two tiles right of the rightmost purple flower is a *Tiny Mushroom.* Enter Gearen Park below.

Gearen Park (Grassy Terrain)

| Grass: Morning| %    | Grass: Day    | %    | Grass: Night    | %    |
|---------------|------|---------------|------|-----------------|------|
| **Pansage**   | 30   | **Pansear**   | 30   | **Panpour**     | 30   |
| **Spearow**   | 30   | **Spearow**   | 30   | **Spearow**     | 30   |
| **Skwovet**   | 15   | **Skwovet**   | 15   | **Stunky**      | 15   |
| **Psyduck**   | 14   | **Psyduck**   | 14   | **Psyduck**     | 14   |
| **Fomantis**  | 9    | **Fomantis**  | 9    | **Kricketot**   | 9    |
| **Seedot**    | 1    | **Seedot**    | 1    | **Seedot**      | 1    |
| **Mankey**    | 1    | **Mankey**    | 1    | **Mankey**      | 1    |

The first tile below the really tall grass in the second column on the left of really tall grass has a hidden *Honey.* Straight down, another *Honey* is three tiles up from the bottom flower. In the left tile of the tree straight left from the bench here, you'll find a *Carbos.* On the right side of the park, there is a hidden *Rare Candy* in the second empty spot among really tall grass from the bottom. Up from here in between a square of 7 tall grass and a purple flower is a *Blue Shard*, and 4 tiles up and 2 left is a *Muscle Wing*. Finally in the concrete on the bottom, in the center two tiles up from the bottom, is a *Yellow Shard.*

## Sewers Visit 1

To progress the story, head east into Venam's front yard, down from here a bit, and see a cutscene. Head to the Emporium to get a *Pecha Berry?* from the attendant. Give it to Venam.

Relationship Point Choices:
- All me. (Venam +2)
- Maybe... (Venam +1)
- No, actually. (Neutral)

Head to the southeast of town and a cutscene will play. Afterwards follow Venam into the sewers. You'll be teaming up with Ren here, who will heal your Pokemon after every battle. Additionally, if you try to catch Pokemon while with Ren, you'll need to knock one of the two out in order to catch the other, which can be frustrating.

Anyways, there are lots of new Pokemon here:

Abandoned Sewers

| Cave             | %    | Old Rod    | %    |
|------------------|------|------------|------|
| Rattata (Alolan) | 30   | **Grimer** | 100  |
| **Trubbish**     | 20   |            |      |
| Poochyena        | 15   |            |      |
| **Gulpin**       | 10   |            |      |
| **Ekans**        | 10   |            |      |
| **Koffing**      | 9    |            |      |
| **Noibat**       | 5    |            |      |
| **Geodude**      | 1    |            |      |

Head left, and on the second tile from left at the bottom is a hidden *Poison Gem.* Head across the bridge and right to get a *Great Ball.* Go up and before crossing the bridge, there is a hidden *Zinc* in the bottom right corner. Talk to a bug catcher to get a *Pecha Berry.* To the right is a *Bold Mint.* Above the girl to the left is a hidden *Potion* and in the thing to the right is another *Potion.*

Heading back down and crossing to the left, if the guy flushed it at the Hotel, go left and all the way down to grab the *Coin Case!* The corner to the right and down has a hidden *Reverse Candy.*

Attempt to enter the room Venam runs into and it will lock you out. There's an *Antidote* to the left.

Head back across the bridge, up and left to the generator room. Start the third, first, then second generator. Go back into the room Venam went into for a long cutscene and a battle.

    -   Toxic Spikes

Knocking out the Trubbish makes this a two-on-one. Any of your new Poison-types should be able to resist getting poisoned here, but really any strong STAB moves can take out the Trubbish. Ren's Growlithe hits hard with Ember, plus he has two more in the back, so you shouldn't really have to worry here.

## Game Corner Prizes

Now's a good time to mention all the prizes available in the game corner. While you can get them all right now with enough patience, it's not necessary to grab everything right now.

Anyways, there's a grand total of 120 coins along the ground in there, try to find them all. Otherwise, here's what you can get here:

Game Corner Coin Shop

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|50 Coins   |$1000     |
|500 Coins  |$10000    |


Game Corner Left Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*TM70 Flash*       |1000 Coins |
|*TM10 Hidden Power*|5000 Coins |

Game Corner Right Shop

|Item          |Price      |
|--------------|-----------|
|**Seel**      |1000 Coins |
|**Spoink**    |4000 Coins |
|**Maractus**  |5000 Coins |
|**Helioptile**|6500 Coins |

To get coins you can buy them or play the various games in the casino. Of these, Voltorb Flip is easily the most efficient once you know what you're doing... but with the luck involved it will take quite a while still. I recommend getting Spoink for the gym and Hidden Power in order to spice up your early game movesets, but it's up to you.

The attendant on the left is the lotto corner lady, who'll pick one number a day and check if it matches your Pokemon's, like in the official games. The prizes are as follows:

Loto Attendant

|Prize          |Digits Matched|
|---------------|--------------|
|*Master Ball*  |5 Matches     |
|*Max Revive*   |4 Matches     |
|*Exp. Share*   |3 Matches     |
|*PP Up*        |2 Matches     |
|*Ultra Ball*   |1 Matches     |

Anyways, once you've gambled to your heart's content, there is a bit more optional stuff to do if you want.

In Gearen Park, talk to Melia for an optional scene for Relationship Points (Melia +3).

Relationship Point Choices:
- You like photography? (Melia +1)
- What are you doing? (Neutral)

Relationship Point Choices:
- I love photography! (Melia +2)
- I appreciate the art! (Melia +1)
- It's not for me. (Neutral)
- Photography's boring. (Melia -2)

Additionally, head back to Magnolia Library, and for a short time you'll be able to battle Ren -- it's optional experience and money should you want it.

## PoisonHeart Badge

It's time to take on Venam's gym in East Gearen. This gym will require us to mix colors to make composite colors.

Take out the first trainer and learn the color combination we need to build is Magenta. To mix magenta, add red and blue.

In the second room, we're going to make orange and green. Do red and yellow first, then check the machine. Then do teal and yellow to make green and move into the third room.

The trainer in the next room will tell you to make Orange, White, and Teal.

The first is red + yellow, and the second is green + red + blue. Finally, add just green + blue and we're in.

Well, that would be all we have to do, but there's a secret. If you mix brown, then white, then orange, you'll get access to a secret area. A fun fact: the Seviper and Venipede boarded up gyms are versions of Venam's gym from older versions of Rejuvenation!

After emerging, two tiles to the left of the top dumpster is a hidden *Psychic Gem.* Up the stairs all the way left is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

In the upper left corner here, you can find a hidden *Rare Candy!* One tile down and 4 right is a hidden *Red Shard.* Here too is a **Seviper** Egg as well as a *Fresh Water* hidden 4 tiles right of it.

Gearen Alleyway

| Grass        | %        |
|--------------|----------|
| **Sentret**  | 30       |
| Poochyena    | 20       |
| **Rattata**  | 20       |
| **Drowzee**  | 15       |
| **Munna**    | 6        |
| Pidgey       | 5        |
| Patrat       | 4        |

Well, that's about it for that area, so clear your team, equip all the good items you can take advantage of (Oran and Pecha Berries work well here), and save.

Punk Girl Venam (Corrosive Field)
-   Trubbish, Level 12. @ Oran Berry.
    -   Rock Blast
    -   Venam's Kiss
    -   Thief

-   Seviper, Level 15. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Bite
    -   Bulldoze
    -   Glare
    -   Venam's Kiss

Venam's Kiss: Poison \| Physical \| 75 power \| 100% accuracy \| 10% chance to poison, super-effective against Steel-types.

Honestly, this one isn't too bad. If you've picked up Chingling or Spoink, they can wreck the house here. Marshtomp, my starter, helped as well, though Mud Shot gains Poison typing on the field. Ultimately this is not too bad and if you're really struggling with an under leveled team you can push them to the Lv. 18 cap and win by sheer stat advantage.

After the battle, you'll be rewarded with the *PoisonHeart Badge*! She'll also give you *TM102 Poison Sweep!* This is a new move that can be useful in the early game.

## Post-Gym Quests

Some quests have opened, everything in this section is optional though.

Return to Gearen Lab. The girl by the PC will gift you an **Aevian Feebas** from Jan! How nice of him.

Head to the Magnolia Library. Talk to the guard of the stairs to the right. As you have a badge, she'll let you pass.

Upstairs, you'll find a Black Belt who will offer to teach more tutor moves for shards.

Library 2F Move Tutor

|Move       |Price          |
|-----------|---------------|
|Dual Chop  |2 Yellow Shards|
|Block      |2 Blue Shards  |
|Super Fang |2 Red Shards   |

Of these, Super Fang can be useful for catching Pokemon, and Dual Chop can give you coverage against Dragon types if you really need it.

Talk to the girl on the right. This is Zumi, and she'll start us on a Pokedex collection quest. We'll be back once we catch a Dedenne for her.

Head into Venam's house south of the hotel. If you head upstairs, you'll find a *Poison Barb.*

Back in Gearen Park, now you'll be able to give a treat to **Gossifleur** for a battle!

Head back to Gearen Lab and talk to the girl sitting by the computer on the left. Now that we have a badge, she'll ask for some help with an online fangame league. She'll then give you a *Badge Card.* Talk to her again and agree to help.

Your first battle is against Falkner.

Gym Leader Falkner (Glitch Field)
-   Hoothoot, Level 11.
    -   Confusion
    -   Peck
    -   Hypnosis
-   Noctowl, Level 12.
    -   Confusion
    -   Peck
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Echoed Voice

I am using Cyndaquil and Onix. Use Ember and Rock Tomb and you should come out on top. If you win, you'll get a *Virtual Badge.* That's all she needs for now, we'll come back after we have two badges.

One shop has updated inventory now that we have a badge. Head to the Shopping Emporium.

Poke Ball Emporium Shop: New Items (1 Badge)

|Item       |Price  |
|-----------|-------|
|*Love Ball*|$300   |
|*Fast Ball*|$300   |

Love Balls are a very useful ball for their price, just pay attention to the gender of what you're trying to catch.

Now's a good time to start taking on the Help Center quests, so head into the help center. You'll be approached by Ayuda, who'll give you a quest to collect Zygarde cells. He'll give you the *Gather Cube* to begin this quest. We will finish the help quests first, then get the cells.

    -   Astonish

This is a tough battle to be sure, and this won't be the last time you'll face her. If you can't really win with your team right now don't worry, you can come back later to finish this one.

Anyways, all that's left is to claim your reward at the help center --
$350 and **Pichu!** (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 7: Wretched Music

Talk to the receptionist at the Chrisola Hotel and agree to go to the basement.

Dance Prodigy Rorim B (No Field)
-   Spinda, Level 15.
    -   Teeter Dance
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Dizzy Punch
    -   Psybeam
-   Vivillon, Level 16. @ Kee Berry.
    -   Quiver Dance
    -   Signal Beam
    -   Draining Kiss
    -   Psybeam
-   Oricorio, Level 16.
    -   Featherdance
    -   Teeter Dance
    -   Revelation Dance
    -   Air Cutter
-   Ludicolo, Level 17. @ Mystic Water.
    -   Teeter Dance
    -   Rain Dance
    -   Bubblebeam
    -   Knock Off

Be careful of Ludicolo, rain boosted Bubblebeams can hurt. Vivillon too can be threatening if it sets up. This battle isn't super hard with a good flying type or two, or probably most well-rounded sixes.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You should stop. (RorimB -1)
- Yeah, he's a jerk. (RorimB +2)
- The other guests...? (RorimB +1)

Upstairs, talk to the bell boy in the left hallway, and the girl in the top-left room in the right hallway.

Return to the help center to get your reward: $1100 and a *GourmetTreat*, but also *TM119 Magical Leaf!* (+1 Karma)

Now we can start looking for Zygarde Cells!

ZCell 001: East Gearen City

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image1.png"/>

ZCell 002: Oceana Pier

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image2.png"/>

ZCell 003: Chrisola Rooftop (Daytime Only)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image3.png"/>

ZCell 004: Gearen Alleyway (through Venam's secret tunnel)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image4.png"/>

## Route 1 and Goldenwood Forest

Once you're ready to leave, head to the northwest part of town and enter the train station. Inside the station, you'll meet up with Tesla, who'll buy you a ticket and give you *Potions.* Talk to the grandfather in the station and agree to help him, then board the train.

Route 1

| Grass: Morning| %    | Grass: Day    | % | Grass: Night    | %    |
|---------------|------|---------------|---|-----------------|------|
| Caterpie      | 30   | Pidove        | 30| **Scatterbug**  | 35   |
| Sentret       | 29   | **Scatterbug**| 30| Pidove          | 30   |
| Pidove        | 10   | **Deerling**  | 16| Weedle          | 20   |
| **Scatterbug**| 10   | Pidgey        | 15| Paras           | 9    |
| Pidgey        | 10   | Sentret       | 8 | **Kakuna**      | 4    |
| **Deerling**  | 10   | **Furret**    | 1 | **Metapod**     | 1    |
| **Furret**    | 1    |               |   | **Furret**      | 1    |

|Old Rod    |%  |
|-----------|---|
|**Finneon**|100|

The tree to the left of the second red flower from the train has a hidden *Potion.* Grab the *Super Repel* and the *Jolly Mint* above.

You'll see a **Whismur** nearby. If you give it a GourmetTreat, it'll battle you!

ZCell 005: Route 1

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image5.png"/>

Head north and enjoy a great cutscene montage with Melia. Once you regain control, interact with Drifblim.

Relationship Point Choices:
- It was no bother! (Narcissa +1)
- It was a complete bother. (Narcissa -1)

You'll get an *HP Up.* Another free $4900! Grab the nearby *Potion* as well and talk to the Furfrou lady for another *Potion.*

Goldenwood Forest

| Grass        | %    | Old Rod| %    |
|--------------|------|--------|------|
| Poochyena    | 30   | Finneon| 100  |
| Sentret      | 24   |        |      |
| Deerling     | 20   |        |      |
| **Spewpa**   | 15   |        |      |
| Pidove       | 10   |        |      |
| Furret       | 1    |        |      |

There are some trainers south to battle. When you're ready, head north into Goldenwood Cave.

Melia will join your party here.

Goldenwood Cave

| Cave        | %    |
|-------------|------|
| Geodude     | 49   |
| Noibat      | 34   |
| **Woobat**  | 15   |
| Furret      | 2    |

Woobat is good for the next gym.

To the right, one of the rocks contains a hidden *Red Shard.* The tile right of a skinny tree above the steps has a *Tiny Mushroom,* and the top left rock as you head down the left stairs has a *Blue Shard.* The top left rock in the area past the bridge hides a *Potion,* and if you head up to the top area on the right, one tile down and three right of the skinny tree is a *Tiny Mushroom,* while another *Tiny Mushroom* is a tile left of the top of two red flowers on the right. Heading back to the top, the rock below Leavanny has a *Great Ball.* If you can, do the optional battle against Mars here.

Culvier Clan Mars (Cave Field)
-   Sewaddle, Level 15. @ Light Clay.
    -   Return
    -   Bug Bite
    -   Seed Bomb
    -   Light Screen
-   Swadloon, Level 18. @ Miracle Seed.
    -   Return
    -   Iron Defense
    -   Seed Bomb
    -   Double Team
-   Leavanny, Level 20. @ Leftovers.
    -   Return
    -   Seed Bomb
    -   Synthesis
    -   Iron Defense

Fire and Flying moves obviously work great here if you can stall out the Light Screen and/or avoid Iron Defense bulk. If you do manage to succeed, you'll get a *Star Shard* and a **Sewaddle**!

If you follow Melia, you'll appear in a small room. Interact with the rock at the top for a *PP Up!* I don't recommend using this on your weak moves just yet, either save it or sell it for $4900.

Make sure you've caught everything you care to in the whole Goldenwood Forest/Cave area, as we won't be able to come back for a little while.

Anyways, heal your team and talk to Melia.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I will cherish it too! (Melia +5)
- It was a good time. (Melia +2)
- it was okay, I guess. (Melia -1)

She'll then challenge you to a battle.

Pre-Leader Melia (Golden Forest field)
-   Buneary, Level 15.
    -   Fake Out
    -   Double Hit
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Baby Doll Eyes
-   Wooloo, Level 15.
    -   Double Kick
    -   Tackle
    -   Defense Curl
    -   Copycat
-   Stufful, Level 14.
    -   Tackle
    -   Leer
    -   Roar
    -   Brutal Swing
-   Togepi, Level 15. @Oran Berry.
    -   Ancient Power
    -   Echoed Voice
    -   Yawn
    -   Metronome

Your second-stage starter should be able to make short work of it, especially paired with Geodude who resists nearly all her attacks, or Nidorina, who can hit hard with Double Kick. Just be careful to not let Togepi buff itself up with Ancientpower too many times and you can make it through.

## Goldenwood Xen Attack

As soon as Melia leaves, head back out through Goldenwood Cave. In the briefcase, enter 3845 for an *Ability Capsule.* In this game you can choose from any ability a Pokemon has. Then enter 6489. You'll get the *Snag Machine* and *10 Poke Balls!* Just like in Colosseum and XD, all you must do is use Poke Balls on opponents' Shadow Pokemon to catch them. Go ahead and catch the first grunt's Shadow Meowth.

Pair up with Melia and head south. Fight the west grunt to capture Shadow Finneon. Melia won't battle with you but will heal your Pokemon if you talk to her. A grunt towards the bottom side of the lake will have a Shadow **Cacnea.** Head to the bottom part of the lake when you're ready.

Team Xen Eli and Sharon (Golden Forest Field)
-   Murkrow, Level 16.
    -   Wing Attack
    -   Pursuit
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Haze
-   Misdreavus, Level 16.
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Psywave
    -   Spite
    -   Growl
-   Glameow, Level 15.
    -   Feint Attack
    -   Scratch
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Attract
-   Stunky, Level 15.
    -   Poison Gas
    -   Smokescreen
    -   Fury Swipes
    -   Bite

A weak early game team, but you'll have to get used to the doubles format present in much of Rejuvenation. Murkrow is the hardest hitter, while you'll have to be careful about the status spreading from Glameow and Stunky.

Team Xen Zetta (Golden Forest Field)
-   Shadow **Snorunt** Level 14.
-   Minior, Level 15.
    -   Rollout
    -   Defense Curl
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Self-Destruct
-   Quilava, Level 15.
    -   Flame Wheel
    -   Quick Attack
    -   Aerial Ace
    -   Smokescreen
-   Type: Null, Level 18.
    -   Pursuit
    -   Double Hit
    -   Hidden Power: Fighting
    -   Aerial Ace
-   Galarian Meowth, Level 16.
    -   Metal Claw
    -   Pay Day
    -   Fake Out
    -   Hone Claws

Start by capturing Snorunt. Quilava and Meowth should not be too threatening at this phase as you should have type coverage but watch out for Minior getting off a Rollout or self-destructing. Type: Null is bulky at this point in the game, but if you can status it, you'll be able to whittle it down.

After witnessing a scene and going north, you'll be able to fight Rift Gyarados.

Dimensional Rift Gyarados (Rift Field)
-   Rift Gyarados, Level 20. Type: Water/Ghost. Stat Spread:
    70/110/100/90/78/100. 1 Shield.
    -   Bite
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Ice Fang
    -   Thunder Fang

This is the first of the Rift fights in Rejuvenation. Essentially it has shield bars like Max Raid Battles in Gen 8 Pokemon. You must deplete the shield before you can do damage. Luckily though it has no way to recover lost stats, so being able to use a move like Growl, Charm, or Noble Roar can really help here. Putting it to sleep is a good way to do this, with the added benefit on this field of draining health while asleep every turn. Making it too weak to knock out your Pokemon is the key to victory. (Winning: +1 Karma) However, the plot will progress even if you lose.

A couple quick, optional things:

First thing we can do is talk to the grandfather in the train station, who'll give you a *Exp. Candy S.*

Head back to Mei and Ayuda to claim your reward for getting all five cells so far: *TM49 Echoed Voice*!

Return to Jenner's Lab and head upstairs. You'll need to battle Madelis' Houndoom as Melia, using Togepi. It requires a LOT of luck to win.
(Winning: +1 Melia Relationship Point). Losing still progresses the game. After a lot of cutscenes, you'll be back outside.
