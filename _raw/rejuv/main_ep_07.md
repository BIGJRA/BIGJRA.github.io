# Chapter 7: A Teila Fire and Ice

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Good morning? (Neutral)
- Does it look like I'm okay? (-1 Aelita)

Make your way down to Terajuma Beach. To the right, you can buy a *Casteliacone* for $100 (or 12 for $1000).

Talk to Holly on the beach, then head to the stage area on the left side. Talk to the familiar musician on the right here, then to Holly again to end the festival.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Encore! (+2 Aelita)
- Uh... (Neutral)

Time for a 2v2 battle. You get to pick four of your Pokemon.

!partner(["Melia",:ENIGMA,1])

!dbattle(["Venam",:LEADER_VENAM,2], ["Saki",:LEADER_SAKI,0], "Glitch Field")

A little Protect or Wide Guard will go a long way if you're stuck here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- I had fun! (+2 Melia)
- It was a hassle... (-2 Melia)

Return to Kakori and talk to Crawli by the squad house. Head upstairs and sleep. Back downstairs, watch Saki's livestream. Shoutout "TerraFan". 

It is worth noting that now that we've beaten Crawli, all the boat rides from Kakori to Oceana Pier and vice versa are free now. Very cool.

## Aquamarine Cave

Head into the Mynori Sea and go west onto Route 5. You'll see Dragonite here once again - it's lost its letters. One is straight to the left of it, one is straight above it, one is on a northeast island, and one is next to the entrance to Aquamarine Cave. Return them to get a *Shiny Stone*!

Grab the hidden *Shoal Shell* and enter the Aquamarine Cave.

!enc(302, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Grab the hidden *Max Repel*, *Elemental Seed*, and *Water Gem*. A guy to the right will give you *TM05 Roar*. Down the ladder, pick up the hidden *Escape Rope* and *Blue Shard*.

!battle(["Fiona",:COOLTRAINER_F,0], "Crystal Cavern")

Continuing on, snag the hidden *Rock Gem* and *Synthetic Seed*.

!battle(["Sami",:FISHERMAN,0], "Crystal Cavern")

Go surfing north and pick up the hidden *Exp. Candy M*. On the left, mine the rock and use a Blast Powder to reach a *Lax Mint* and hidden *Big Pearl*. Behind another rock is a hidden *Exp. Candy L*, not necessarily worth using Blast Powder on. Head down the ladder at the bottom.

Hidden in this room is *Shoal Salt*, *Shoal Shell*, and *Blue Shard*. Surf on the water and go up through the middle waterfall. Continue into the next room.

You can find a hidden *Super Repel*, *Super Potion*, *GourmetTreat*, and *Green Shard*. Our objective is pushing the floating stones onto the lit up tiles. Push the five stones into place... as well as Braixen into place, to get the door to open.

Hidden are *2 Water Gems*, *Red Shard*, and *Blue Shard*.

!battle(["???",:XENMAGE_M,0], "Water Surface")

Push the stones back onto their spots and step on the tile to break the door once more.

**ZCell 056: Aquamarine Chamber**

!img("zcell056.png")

Back outside, go up the ladder to the left. Grab the hidden *Ice Heal* and hop down. Grab the hidden *Star Piece* and exit to the other side of Route 5. Obtain the hidden *Yellow Shard*, *Ether*, *Love Ball*, *Lemonade*, *Pearl*, and *Repel*. Continue left!

## Teila Resort

To the left, pick the *Occa Berry*, as well as:

**ZCell 057: Teila Resort**

!img("zcell057.png")

Go left and up, to the large building. Go right to get a hidden *Full Heal* and a *Lax Mint*, then enter the large building. After the conversation, talk to the person at the front desk to get a souvenir for the *A Souvenir For Mom* quest. Go up to the PC and grab Shelmet and Oranguru. Back on the east side of Teila Resort, talk to the old man near the above cell, show him Shelmet, and obtain a *Shell Bell*!

Go left then down at your first opportunity to grab a *Hyper Potion* as well as:

**ZCell 058: Teila Resort**

!img("zcell058.png")

Inside this house, show a Psychic type (the Oranguru) to a person at the top right to get *Wise Glasses*. The man below wants to trade Oranguru for **Passimian**!

Outside, go left. Grab the *Elixir* and hidden *Rawst Berry*, *Water Gem*, and *Blue Shard*. At the bottom, there are some shops:

!shop("Teila Resort (Top)", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Super Potion", "Full Heal", "Antidote", "Ice Heal", "Paralyze Heal", "Burn Heal", "GourmetTreat", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Reverse Candy"])

!shop("Teila Resort (Middle)", ["Apophyll Pancakes", "Tart Apple", "Sweet Apple"])

The bottom vendor sells *Berry Juice* for $1000.

Above, to the left, you'll see a Noctowl Statue to activate for fast travel. Reenter the building at the top of Teila Resort. Show your fighting type (Passimian?) to a guy inside to get a *Muscle Band*. Head upstairs and enter the room on the right:

**ZCell 059: Teila Resort**

!img("zcell059.png")

Downstairs on the left side, you can buy Pokemon massage packages. The cheapest is $1500, the next is $3500, and the last is $6500, which comes with *3 Fresh Waters* and *3 Revives*! Each sequentially increases your Pokemon's happiness.

Enter Tesla's office on the right. She will give us *TM101 Rock Climb*! Head back outside.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- You're foolish. (+2 Melia, -1 Venam)
- Contacts Smonctracts. (-1 Melia, +2 Venam)
- You're stupid. (-2 Melia, -2 Venam)

## Aquamarine Cave 2

Next, we must go find Amber. Re-enter Aquamarine Cave, Rock Climb to the right, then follow the path down to the basement as we did before. Take the second ladder down to the depths. All the way on the right, you can Rock Climb to *TM20 Safeguard*!

Climb back up the ladder and Rock Climb to the left. Pick up the *Water Stone* as well as the hidden *2 Pearls* and *2 Blue Shards*, then go down the ladder.

Grab the hidden *Fresh Water* and *Ether*, then go to the top right. After the conversation, decline the fast travel request, because there is a ladder to a new area in the bottom right side of this map: take it. Get the hidden *Green Shard* and go right.

!battle(["Heather",:LADY,0], "Crystal Cavern")

!battle(["Ronnie",:BLACKBELT,0], "Crystal Cavern")
 
Go down and right, grab the hidden *Rock Gem*, then go right.

!battle(["Becky",:COOLTRAINER_F,0], "Crystal Cavern")

Pick up the hidden *Blue Shard* and go up.

!battle(["Lex",:ROCKER,0], "Crystal Cavern")

The *Sea Incense* is at the top. Hop down the ledges to the bottom right corner of the room. If you got one from the Kecleon Bazaar earlier, give a Protein to the man in exchange for **Tyrogue**! Pick up the *Link Heart* to the left... then climb the nearby ladder by going all the way back around the ledges.

Nab the hidden *Escape Rope* and *Synthetic Seed*, then go up. This next area has a hidden *Elixir* and *Elemental Seed*. 

!enc(325, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Talk to the man in here, then surf to the left side of the room and use Rock Climb. Mine some rocks. Note that there is a hidden *Link Heart* behind a rock, but we are out of Blast Powder. Back on the water, you can find Poliwag #5 for the *Poliwag Quest*! Climb the rocks on the right side of the map to get a hidden *Hyper Potion* as well as a *Mild Mint* and *4 Exp. Candy L*. Exit the Secluded Shore at the top to reach a new section of Route 5. Straight up:

**ZCell 060: Route 5**

!img("zcell060.png")

Go down and right. You'll find a hidden *Pearl* and *Zinc* as well as a *Sun Stone* and *TM104 Deluge*. To the left you'll find a hidden *Resist Wing* in the water. 

Go south, back through Aquamarine Cave, and return to Teila Resort and go to Tesla's Office.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- What did you do? (Neutral)
- It's not your fault. (+2 Tesla)
- Maybe it was. (-4 Melia if current Melia points < 0, else -2)

Head back outside and enter the house to the left, previously blocked by Saki:

**ZCell 061: Teila Resort**

!img("zcell061.png")

Talk to Melia inside the previous house and agree to sleep. Wake up, talk to the crew outside, then to Tesla in her office.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Sorry. (-2 Amber)
- ... (+1 Amber)
- It's weird ass hell out here. (+2 Amber)

Go right in Aquamarine Cave for a conversation.

!battle(["Jenner",:PROFJENNER,0], "Crystal Cavern")

For winning, you will get **Slowpoke (Galarian)**! You can choose between a *Galarica Cuff* and a *Galarica Wreath*.

Once you're back in Teila, sleep again by talking to Melia. Head outside to learn of our trial in Magrodar Crater!

## Magrodar Crater

!enc(213)

Catch a Spinda while we're here to trade away, later. To the left, push a floating rock out of the way to get a *Sun Stone* and:

**ZCell 062: Magrodar Crater**

!img("zcell062.png")

!battle(["Valencia",:LADY,0], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Brady",:CHARMER,0], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Alex",:POKEMONRANGER_F1,1], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Hen",:HIKER,0], "Rocky Field")

!battle(["Sam",:POKEMONRANGER_M1,1], "Rocky Field")

On the right, grab a *Charcoal* as well as:

**ZCell 063: Magrodar Crater**

!img("zcell063.png")

!boss("TAPUKOKOMAGRODAR", "Volcanic Field")

This is a tough fight, in no small part thanks to the SOS Charizard hitting really hard on this field. Tapu Koko likes to use screens, so being able to break those or score critical hits is key. Especially when against Mega Charizard X, Ground moves like Bulldoze and Earthquake are good ideas for heavy spread damage. You'll get the Earth Relic after!

Enter Tesla's Villa next to the Noctowl Statue. Head upstairs, exiting at the bottom left to grab a *Protein*. Now you can return to Aquamarine Cave to get Tyrogue, if you haven't yet. Anyways, talk to Tesla downstairs and start dinner.

She'll offer you food - choose whichever you like. If you want something sweet, you'll get a *Strawberry Cake*! If you want something relaxing, you'll get a *Rose Tea*! If you want something rejuvenating, you'll get an *Herbal Tea*! If you want something sour, you'll get a *Razz Berry Tart*!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- How do you know him? (Neutral)
- Does he deserve this? (-2 Tesla)

Upstairs:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Thank you... (+2 Tesla)
- I don't know what to say... (Neutral)
- ... (-3 Tesla)

Tesla will give you her *Yacht Keys*. Inside the gift box to the left is the *Furret Crest*, *3 Glitter Balls*, *2 Cell Imprints*, *2 Black Prisms*, *12 Moomoo Milks*, *12 Lava Cookies*, and *10 Exp. Candy XL*.

Follow Amber into her room next.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Are you okay? (Neutral)
- Stop being a child. (-3 Amber)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- I'm here to help. (+2 Amber)
- What next? (Neutral)

## Attacks on Terajuma

Say "Let's go" to fast travel. Once you get control in the cave, head left. It's a bit hard to see. You'll once again regain control: go right and down to escape.

!partner(["Melia",:ENIGMA,1])

!dbattle(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,6], ["Bartz",:XENMAGE_M,0])

Another fun battle with a Xen Mage - they can cause all kinds of effects in battle. Melia's Meganium is an absolute tank with its Crest, so this shouldn't be too hard.

Back outside on Route 5, grab the hidden *Calcium* by the boat, then go back to Tesla's office in Teila Resort.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- We have to. (+1 Melia)
- I don't know... (Neutral)
- Depends on the mood. (-3 if current Melia points < 1, else -1)

Time for a GAUNTLET. That's right. Two battles, back to back, no healing in between.

!battle(["Harris",:XENMAGE_M,0])

!battle(["Neved",:XENEXECUTIVE_4,2])

In the villa, talk to Crawli.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Let's take her down. (+2 Melia, +3 Venam, +2 Aelita, +4 Crawli, +4 Adam, +2 Valarie, +2 Braixen)
- I'd rather not... (-2 Melia, -3 Venam, -1 Aelita, -2 Valarie, -4 Adam, -4 Crawli, -2 Braixen)

Once you're in Frozen Kakori Village, get the hidden *Super Repel* to the left. There are *4 Yache Berries* in the southeast corner. Enter the Ranger HQ and talk to Farha at the top. Meet her on the left island in the Mynori Sea, then take the Kakori Noctowl over to Teila Resort. Enter the villa and talk to the crew.

*Special Scene: Valarie's Insecurity* requires 6 Relationship Points with both Valarie and Adam at this point.

## Rock Climb Exploration

Before we continue the story, we got sidequests and exploration to do!

First, add something to your party with Headbutt. Surf over to the Jirukala Cavern to the north of Mynori Sea. Rock Climb to the left and go up.

!enc(211)

In the trees here, you can headbutt! You have an 11% chance each to get *3 Oran Berries*, *3 Sitrus Berries*, or *3 Leppa Berries*, but also an 11% chance to get **Greedent**, 22% chance to get Skwovet, and 33% chance to get **Applin**! Grab the *Modest Mint* and *TM133 Mud Shot*. That's all we can do here for now.

Make your way next to Jynnobi Pass. Talk to the girl on the southern balcony to give her *A Souvenir For Mom*. She'll give us the *Fighting Memory* as well as:

**ZCell 064: Jynnobi Pass**

!img("zcell064.png")

Use Noctowl to get over to Helojak Island. On the east side, you can use Rock Climb to reach a hidden *Rare Candy* and **Mudkip**!

Return to Kakori and use the boat to get back to Gearen. 

Remember that impossible fight in the Aqua Building? Well, I was able to beat it at this point, so why not give it a shot. Not essential to get done now, but if you can, why not. All you need is a really strong physical attacker to take advantage of Abra's Trick Room and one-shot Alakazam... or a Shedinja, past Kadabra!

!battle(["Mercury",:CHALLENGER,0])

Winning awards you a *Star Shard*!

The Poke Ball store has added wares.

!shop("Poke Ball Boutique (5 Badges)", ["Heavy Ball", "Moon Ball", "Love Ball", "Fast Ball", "Nest Ball", "Net Ball", "Timer Ball", "Dive Ball", "Friend Ball"])

I recommend taking another trip to the AP shop. If you haven't gotten the Exp. All or the Golden Axe, Hammer, Surfboard, and Claws, do so ASAP. On deck will be the Golden Driftboard and the Golden Gauntlet.

Take the train over to Route 2. Talk to the lady with the Meganium, and since we have five badges, she'll let us have **Chikorita** for the Spinda we got.

Take the truck to Goldenleaf, enter Wispy Tower, and talk to Sariah. She'll give us 3 *Ethers* and start us on a quest for later on. 

Enter Wispy Ruins through the Wispy Tower area entrance. Climb the rocks and head down the ivy by the waterfalls into Wispy Chasm.

!enc(508, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Head all the way down, picking up hidden *Dark Gem* as you go. Around the bottom, step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 6: a **Scraggy**!

Back in the chasm, head towards the middle, then go down to get a *Rare Candy* and *TM65 Shadow Claw*. Go up from here.

!battle(["Kain",:BLACKBELT,0], "Haunted Field")

Surf across up above to get to another gate. Step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 3: a *Shiny Stone*!

Head back up the ivy, enter the room on the right, and go down this ivy. There is a hidden *Yellow Shard*, *Ghost Gem*, and *Reverse Candy*. Grab the *Poke Doll* when you go down. We can't open any more doors for now, so exit the ruins. 

Make your way back to Akuwa Town. Enter Evergreen Forest and climb the rocks to get an *Icy Rock* and *TM32 Double Team*!

## Amethyst Depths

Take the truck to Sheridan Village and enter Amethyst Cave. In the second room, Rock Climb down. Talk to April, then activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 3 to the right. Grab the hidden *Rock Gem*, *Steel Gem,* and *Water Gem*, then follow her left.

**ZCell 065: Amethyst Cave**

!img("zcell065.png")

Talk to April again, then enter the room in the top left. Surf left, activate the panel if you haven't, and get *TM01 Work Up* below.

Return to the entrance of the cave from Route 2. Take the stairs to the right, then head across the first bridge on top. Rock climb here, pick up the hidden *Zinc*, and head in.

!enc(162, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Exit on the bottom doors to the left to meet Alisha, the tenth of the *Lost Souls* for the sidequest. There is a hidden *Carbos* here.

Back up from here, grab the *Elixir* and enter the cave on the left.

!boss("AMETHYSTREGIROCK", "Crystal Cavern")

Not impossible if you can lower its attack with a burn or something similar! Grab *TM69 Rock Polish*, activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 4, then head to the upper right door and enter for a similar battle!

!boss("AMETHYSTREGISTEEL", "Crystal Cavern")

Grab the *Moon Dial* and activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 5 here, then head down the ladder on the left. 

Grab hidden *Rock Gem*, *Super Repel*, and *Ether*.

Talk to the ex-Xen Grunt in the open area. Head down the ladder here and activate Amethyst Power Supply Panel 6 on the right.

Head down and rock climb down from here. We're gonna need to smash the crystals in this new area somehow: the wild Geodude have Magnitude and can do it, alternatively, if you have the Bulldoze TM, then you can use that. Once you succeed, head down to the bottom of this area and interact with this crystal for a chance to catch **Aevian Lapras!**

With all six panels activated, head back to the Xen grunt and activate the machine. The Xen guy will head up, so grab the hidden *PP Up* and climb the ladder. Grab the *Code Feris Rift Notes* and prepare yourself.

Talk to the Grunt and save in front of the statue. Talk to the grunt again, and you'll have to fight:

!battle(["Nancy",:SUPERSTAR,0], "Mountain Field")

The Tailwind makes this otherwise somewhat slow team outspeed you, but stalling it out tends to lead to an easy sweep for a physical Poison or Steel type.

!boss("RIFTCHANDELURE", "Mountain Field")

With three shields, it takes a lot to defeat Rift Chandelure. It has an insane Special Attack stat, with Shadow Ball and Air Slash consistently and a different special STAB at each phase. Since it recovers stat changes at each stage, status conditions are especially key here. With only 99 HP and 69 Def its physical bulk is nothing to write home about - with a new held gem at each phase, I recommend going the fully powered Knock Off. You also have the power of 'cheese' in your pocket thanks to the Trace ability - at each phase you can brick it with a harmful ability like Truant! 

Exit at the top and talk to Manny. He'll give you a *Shiny Stone*. Hidden around here is a *Rare Candy*, *Elixir*, *Iron*, and *Resist Wing*.

At night, you'll find:

**ZCell 066: Cliffside Grave**

!img("zcell066.png")

Interact with the grave at the top and insert the Cursed Candle we got a while ago to obtain **Litwick**!

With that, return to the room where April is, two maps away from Sheridan. Talk to April. She'll give us the *Phase Dial*! Head in and go up.

!boss("BOSS_CHAOTICFUSION", "Starlight Arena")

!move("SOLARFLARE")

!move("HOARFROSTMOON")

This fight has you oscillating between the forms of Solrock and Lunatone. Interestingly, even as the moveset entirely changes, once the boss commits to using a certain move during a turn, they will use it. This means that breaking a shield while Solrock is dominant and before it attacks will see it use a physical attack while Lunatone is dominant and vice versa - which can be the opening you need to get past its large stats.

We can now use the Phase Dial on our own Solrock and Lunatone to obtain the fusion! Nice. 

Back in Sheridan, go west onto Route 3 and enter the Mirage Woods. Make your way to the Mirage Cave where we once fought Crobat. Use Rock Climb to get the *Data Drive*, *3 Exp. Candy L*, and:

**ZCell 067: Mirage Cave**

!img("zcell067.png")

## Frozen Over Kristiline Town

To progress the story, enter the living room of Tesla's house. Talk to Melia. Then board the boat.

Head west, and Melia and Venam will head towards the T.M. shop. The mart and center are in the upper left area.

Kristiline Town Shop

|Item           |Price|
|---------------|-----|
|*Poke Ball*    |$200 |
|*Great Ball*   |$600 |
|*Super Potion* |$700 |
|*Full Heal*    |$600 |
|*Antidote*     |$100 |
|*Ice Heal*     |$250 |
|*GourmetTreat* |$1500|
|*Super Repel*  |$500 |
|*Max Repel*    |$700 |
|*Reverse Candy*|$50  |

Enter the T.M. shop in the southeast. After a scene and a lesson with Jenner, head up towards the Isle of Angels.

Cross the ice and enter the Church of Theolia.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Yes. (Melia +1)
- No. (Venam +1)

## Tower of Theolia

Grab the 2 *Yache Berries*.

Head up and heal and use the PC if you need. Head upstairs into the Tower of Theolia!

Tower of Theolia

| Cave        | %        |
|-------------|----------|
| Bergmite    | 54       |
| Delibird    | 25       |
| Spheal      | 19       |
| **Swinub**  | 2        |

All of these can be gotten later, so don't worry if you don't want to or can't get them now.

Grab *TM79 Frost Breath* on your way up 2F. Head up, battling the maid, and seeing the scene on the stage. Head up into this next room.

Defeat these maids, and head into the next room.

After an outside portion, you'll meet Kreiss. It's your choice whether to free him. If you do, you'll be rewarded with *TM101 Rock Climb*! Head out to the top after this and follow doors through to the next cutscene. Fight the two maids.

Now, there's a little bit of bonus story content we can get at this point. Backtrack a few rooms, and curtains will be moved so that we can access a new path. Head up to see the scene.

Return to where we were and enter the door. Continue through the path and through the doors. After the cutscene at Teila, talk to Cera for some advice, and heal. At the battlefield, head left to grab a *Hyper Potion* and the top right for a *Max Revive*.

You can exit if need be but go ahead and prepare for the battle ahead!

Cold Truth: Ice \| Special \| 95 power \| 100% accuracy \| Hits both foes in a Double Battle \| Inflicts Torment on the target \| On Frozen Dimensional Field, power is boosted x1.5 \| Turns Dimensional Field into Frozen Dimensional Field.

If you managed to make it through the Novae battles, Valarie, and Crawli, this is the first battle of the game you might really suffer. Part of the problem is just how many things are stacked against you that you must overcome - Icy Dimensional Field, which is difficult to change and can be changed back with a single move, the hail which chips your team down while powering up hers, that her team (even Crabominable with its seed!) is exceptionally speedy, they like to set up Aurora Veil, so you need to break it. Trick Room if you can find it, Drought/Sunny Day and a way to change the field (Heat Wave, Flame Burst, Lava Plume may be your only options) are decent ways to build yourself an advantage. You can also take advantage of the field yourself, as Ice and Dark moves are buffed.

The scene at this point splits a lot and depends on whether you saved Kreiss. If you did, it's straightforward - he'll freeze Angie, and you can exit into a melted Kristiline Town. Here, Kreiss will give you the Glacier Badge!

If you didn't save him, head into 5F, and you'll be taken onto the long staircase. Head all the way down, and Valarie will save the day. Here you'll get the Glacier Badge, and Kreiss will now give you the T.M. for Rock Climb if you didn't save him earlier.

The Glacier Badge lets us Rock Climb and gives up to Level 55 Pokemon.

Head outside the church if you didn't save Kreiss. Regardless of your choice, you'll be given a choice to fast travel back to Teila. We're gonna do some stuff here in Kristiline, so I recommend not accepting the offer.
