# Chapter 13: Conflicting Renunion

### A Note about Where Love Lies

Completing all the content so far marks the recommended point in the story you should consider going to play Version -1: Where Love Lies, a separate game made by the same creators which acts as a prequel to a part of this story. It is not required that you play it but it gives perspective and history on certain events in this game. You can find it [here](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34082-version-1-where-love-lies/&page=1).

If you want a guide to the side story: Lucifer on the forums wrote up a
[fantastic guide](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34308-spoilers-the-completionists-guide-to-where-love-lies/) to getting 100% in the side game, and so I wouldn't want to waste time by writing my own guide to it.

Now onto the chapter.

## Scholar District

Open the box with Melia and Erin. Head south from Route 9 into GDC's Scholar District.

!enc(257)

!battle(["Jakup",:YOUNGSTER,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Kaya",:GUITARIST,0], "City Field")

!battle(["Ken",:CAMPER,0], "City Field")

Using the itemfinder around this district, you'll find a *Blue Shard*, *Hyper Potion*, *Super Potion*, *Green Shard*, *Ether*, *Max Repel*, *Sitrus Berry*, *Casteliacone*, *Lemonade*, and *Honey*.

Enter the Fan Club. Depending on your GDC reputation, you'll get items at this table. I had 660 at this point and was able to get the items: *10 Exp. Candy XL*, *TM68 Giga Impact*, *GourmetTreat*, and *5 Black Prisms*.

Down and to the left outside is the GDC Arcade.

Enter the student rec. center. In the left room you'll find another game corner! Three of the vendors are exactly the same as in Chrisola, but we can get a few new Pokemon. These are pretty expensive.

!shop("GDC Arcade", [["Rookidee", "3000 Coins", true], ["Mienfoo", "4000 Coins", true], ["Durant", "7500 Coins", true], ["Axew", "9000 Coins", true]])

Enter the Blakeory Museum in the top left side of the District, and pay admission. Someone to the right will give you a *Green Shard*. To the left is an in-game trade: your Masquerain for **Smeargle**!

At the top, talk to the museum director to finally continue the *Wall of Shame* quest. Make the long journey back to Arturo in the southwestern house of the Judicial District. Back in the museum, head up to learn the painting has been stolen! Outside, you'll see the thief run off. Chase him to The Underground: he's in the shop building to the right of the diner.

!battle(["Nigel",:ROCKER,0], "Back Alley")

You'll get the *Family Portrait*. Return to the gallery if you wish - Arturo and the director both will say they've moved on from this painting, so we get to keep it. It'll be useful later.

Enter the Blakeory Anatheum on the right side of the district. Talk to Erin inside. Return to the lobby and talk to Huey.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Thanks. (+2 Huey)
- Got any more words? (Neutral)

This is a 3v3 battle.

!battle(["Thomas",:STEELRESERVE,0])

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay? (Neutral)
- C'mon, it wasn't that bad... (-2 Huey)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Ren's sister! (+2 Reina)
- Uh... (-2 Reina)

!battle(["Miya",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

Board the train outside.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- If you exposed Flora, say "You just kidnap people?" (+2 Reina, +1 Huey)
- If you exposed Flora, say "Yes, it's quite nice." (Neutral)

!battle(["Beybe",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Factory Field")

!battle(["Dale",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Factory Field")

Exit the train into Bladestar HQ. You'll have to choose one Pokemon for a 1v2 fight:

!battle(["Risa Raider",:POPSTAR,1], "Factory Field")

TODO: There's a whole lot of story splitting nonsense going on here, and I can't be assed to deal with it on this playthrough. Edit later.

## Voidal Chasm

Take the warp to the next area. Grab the two hidden *Ethers*, then attempt to take the warp at the top. Head down and right: you can hop to continue.

Forgive the numbering: the route splitting makes tracking Zygarde Cells in this part of the game... difficult.

**ZCell 119B: Voidal Chasm**

!img("zcell119b.png")

Backtrack and take the previous warp at the top. Follow the path down.

!dbattle(["Keni",:BLADESTAR_M,0], ["Muriel",:BLADESTAR_F,0], "Dimensional Field")

Grab the hidden *Ether* and *Old Scarf*, then proceed. Grab *TM148 Phantom Force* and exit to the desert!

## Zorrialyn Desert

Activate the Braviary Post here, our first for the Badlands region of Aevium!

!enc(373, nil, nil, "Zorrialyn Desert (East)")

Make sure you catch Aevian Budew for Zumi's quest. Interact with **Mandibuzz** flying around for a battle. There are also **Alolan Exeggutor**, **Gligar**, and **Arbok** in various spots in the desert.

**ZCell 118: Zorrialyn Desert**

!img("zcell118.png")

Pick up the hidden *Red Shard*, *Ether*, *2 Max Repels*, and *Yellow Shard*.

!battle(["Clidus",:HIKER,0], "Desert Field")

Cross the bridge below.

!battle(["Jowy",:BLACKBELT,0], "Desert Field")

Grab the *Revive*, and hidden *Leaf Stone* and *Kebia Berry* to the right. Down from here is an *Iron*. To the left is a hidden *Heavy Ball* and *PP Up*. Continue left. We will explore Fort Rystrine later on. Head up for a hidden *Lemonade*. To the right, hidden behind a Blast Powder rock is a *Synthetic Seed*.

Cross under an archway above to reach a hidden *Reverse Candy* and *Revival Herb*, as well as a *Smooth Rock* and *Max Ether*. Continue into Zorrialyn Desert (West) by going west at the top left side of the map.

!enc(510, nil, nil, "Zorrialyn Desert (West)")

You can find a hidden *Hard Stone*, *Rare Bone*, *Red Shard* below, plus an *Exp. Candy XL*. Continuing to the left is a hidden *Yellow Shard* and *Thick Club*. Head back up and cross to the left. You can find a hidden *Reverse Candy*, *Yellow Shard*, *Sitrus Berry*, *Occa Berry*, *Ground Gem*, and *Petaya Berry*, as well as a *Sun Stone*. Double back to the top right side of the map and use Rock Climb to reach *TM37 Sandstorm* as well as a hidden *Haban Berry* and *HP Up*. You can also use Rock Climb a bit to the left to reach a hidden *Thick Club*, *Calcium*, and *Green Shard*, plus:

**ZCell 117: Zorrialyn Desert**

!img("zcell117.png")

Head to the Zorrialyn Coast in the southwest.

!enc(515, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Go to the east to find:

**ZCell 116: Zorrialyn Coast**

!img("zcell116.png")

Activate the Braviary Post here. To the right is the final Luck's Tent! Continue further to the right. 

!battle(["Jai'so",:DESERTDWELLER_MB,0], "Desert Field")

Pick up the hidden *Dusk Ball*, *Poke Doll*, *Heart Scale*, and *Red Shard*. To the right is an *Escape Rope*. 

!battle(["Sai'yo",:DESERTDWELLER_FW,0], "Desert Field")

We will do the Zorrialyn Labyrinth later on, so head left and down. Grab the hidden *Dark Gem*, *Dusk Ball*, and *Water Gem*.

Nothing awaits us at the end of the path yet, so head north then west into Sashila Village!

## Sashila Village

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Trust Ren on this. (Neutral)
- Something's wrong. (+3 Reina)

Grab a hidden *Grass Gem* above. Attempt to head north to talk to Alexandra. There is a breeder to the right who will award you with *5 Exp. Candy XL* for winning.

!battle(["Philip",:POKEBREEDER_M,0], "Desert Field")

Stay on top of the roof and go down and around to the right. Talk to the man here to get access to the Sand Stream Cave. You'll also find:

**ZCell 115: Sashila Village**

!img("zcell115.png")

To the right you can find a hidden *Max Repel*, *Moon Stone*, and *Link Heart*. Go up through the school area to emerge outside again, and grab the hidden *GourmetTreat*. To the left is a hidden *Lemonade*.

To the left, enter the Study Library. Talk to someone to get the *House Key*! Outside, you can get some lore by paying the Informant below. Grab the hidden *HP Up* below.

!shop("Sashila Shop", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Mineral Ball", "Hyper Potion", "Max Repel", "Burn Heal", "GourmetTreat", "Reverse Candy"])

Re-enter the school area to the north of the battlefield on the east side to talk to Ren and Ryland.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Ren and Ryland without having helped Ryland on Route 6 (-2 Ryland)

Head to the top of Sashila Village to talk to the group. Enter the inn towards the center of the village and go to sleep.

*Special Scene: The Twin's Fate* requires 3+ Relationship Points with Reina at this point.

## Hospital of Ruin

Time for another section where we get to control a different character. Exit your room and leave to the left. Talk to the elevator, and head down the shaft.

Head down to talk to the computer at the bottom of the shaft, then head up. Interact with the B1 door to listen in on a conversation. Then, head up to 1F and exit the shaft. In the rightmost room of the floor, read all the computer files in the office.

Back down in the shaft, type 8433 in the console at the bottom.

Down here, enter the room on the left, then press the panel. Enter the room at the top and talk to Braixen. Head to the bottom-right and follow the path.

Choose whether or not to release Giratina - it will join your party for the next fight if you do:

!newself(["Lavender",:LEADER_LAVENDER,4])

!battle(["Edwind",:XENANALYST_M,0], "Factory Field")

If you have Giratina this is winnable, but winning is not necessary.

## Alamissa Urben

We will be in control of ourselves once more.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Leave it to me. (+4 Reina)
- I dunno... (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Talk to Alexandra on your way out of Sashila Village (+5 Alexandra)

Talking to her also awards *5 Revives*, *5 Max Potions*, and *5 Exp. Candy XL*.

Exit the village. Attempt to use the House Key in the building all the way at the bottom of Sashila Coast, and it will snap in half. We'll continue that quest a bit later on.

Enter Alamissa Urben at the top of Zorrialyn Desert East. Talk to Ren at the entrance and you'll get **Sylveon**, as well as the *Mysterious Black Box*. 

!enc(518)

The first area contains a hidden *Yellow Shard* and *Red Shard*. Go left.

!battle(["Nami",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

*2 Red Shards* and *3 Yellow Shards* are hidden outside. Grab the *Poke Toy* and head up.

!battle(["Poro",:BLADESTAR_M,0], "Desert Field")

Grab the hidden *2 Red Shards* and go down the ladder. 

!battle(["Jed",:BLADESTAR_M,0])

Smash some rocks outside to create shortcuts.

!battle(["Kido",:BLADESTAR_M,0])

Itemfind the *2 Yellow Shards* and continue.

!battle(["Shina",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

Grab the hidden *Yellow Shard* outside the left door and climb the ladder.

!battle(["Yuna",:BLADESTAR_F,0])

You can catch **Falinks** here! Smash a shortcut rock and find the hidden *Yellow Shard*. At the bottom of the area is a *Power Bracer*. Enter the right door and go up. Grab another *Poke Toy* and further a hidden *Revive*, *5 Red Shards*, and *3 Yellow Shards*. At the center of the area is a Braviary Post! Enter a building in the top left and go downstairs to get a *Prism Scale*!

Finally, exit the area at the top. Proceed forward when ready.

## Blakeory Atheneum Tour

You'll be playing as Melia once more. Talk to Hazuki in the entrance room. You can input your own question prompts by typing "Thomas Jr.", "Vivian", "Ayame", or "Nymiera".

Return to Erin, then climb the stairs to use the indicated computer at the bottom. After your chat with Thomas, talk to Erin once more.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- 45 <= Melia Points (+6 Erin)
- 10 <= Melia Points < 45 (+2 Erin)
- 0 <= Melia Points < 10 (Neutral)
- Melia Points < 0 (-6 Erin)

Reenter the entrance room and talk to the box in the bottom right. Behind the large pink tree, you'll encounter a Youngster.

!newself(["Melia",:ENIGMA_1,5])

!battle(["Luke",:YOUNGSTER,0])

Return to Erin once more. After some scenes:

!battle(["Erin",:CANDIDGIRL,2])

Win or lose, the game will continue. Finish watching the wholesome scene and proceed.

## The Third Trip to Past Aevium

!enc(322)

Pick up the *Revive* and hidden *Red Shard*. Across the bridge is a hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Blue Shard*. Pick up the *Max Revive* to the right. Continue to the northeast to enter Hiyoshi City.

!enc(330)

Enter the first building to the right to grab a hidden *Ultra Potion*. At the east side of the town, there is a breeder who will award you with *10 Exp. Candy XLs*.

!battle(["Jimbo",:POKEBREEDER_M,0])

!shop("Hiyoshi City Berries", ["Sitrus Berry", "Chesto Berry"])

!shop("Hiyoshi City Mart", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Super Potion", "Hyper Potion", "Ultra Potion", "Awakening", "GourmetTreat", "Reverse Candy", "Super Repel", "Max Repel"])

!tutor("Hiyoshi City Move Tutor", [["Sky Attack", "3 Red Shards"], ["Skill Swap", "2 Green Shards"], ["Magnet Rise", "2 Yellow Shards"], ["Gravity", "2 Blue Shards"], ["Recycle", "2 Green Shards"]])

These moves we have already had access to for a while, so this seems to be a development oversight that this remains in.

Talk to Hazuki in the northwest of the city, then head into the house via the secret tunnel and talk to Nymiera. Talk to Huey in the corner to get some crazy backstory.

Exit the house and enter the building above with the PC. Hidden in here is an *Ether*. Talk to the group in the southwest area of town. Then, head north to board the truck to Hiyoshi Pass.

!enc(374, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Grab the *TM27 Return* on the right, then head up.

We'll now be playing as Ren!

!newself(["Ren",:OUTCAST,1])

Head up to where your main character passed out. You can talk to surfboard guy multiple times and even input a name to get a unique dialogue (Kieran). Attack or defend, you'll have to battle.

!battle(["???",:UNKNOWN_1,0])

First time we're using Ren's team. Luckily, it's not too awful. Zepto can beat Raichu and dent Swampert, then there's just enough priority and SpD on the team that you can take out  Xurkitree.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Defeat Kieran as Ren (+4 Ren)

Head to the south-central square in town. After the scene, head to the Hiyoshi Pass again. Attempt to enter Rejuvenation Co., then head back to the city. Talk to the woman directly above the truck, then head to Route 5. Head west as soon as you can on Route 5 and talk to Anastasia.

!partner(["Anastasia",:RUNAWAYGIRL,0])

!dbattle(["Kenny",:RECO_M,0], ["Jane",:RECO_F,0])

In the building, head west and follow the path, beating all the trainers.

!battle(["Summer",:RECO_F,0])

!battle(["Hayner",:RECO_M,0])

!battle(["Jenny",:RECO_F,0])

!battle(["Mani",:RECO_M,0])

!battle(["Janna",:RECO_F,0])

!battle(["Oswald",:RECO_M,0])

!battle(["Ace",:RECO_M,0])

After the sequence of events, return to Nymiera's house. Talk to the nurse in the inn, then head to the north part of town to engage with the maids. Head straight south. 

!dbattle(["Iana",:SERVANT,0], ["Trish",:SERVANT,0])

Beat the maids, then return to the inn one more time. Enter the tunnel and go up.

We get control of our character again! Return to the tunnel. A butterfly in this area can warp us between here and Sashila Village, should we need to do any preparations.

We're gonna be pushing strength boulders onto the spiked platforms. 

!battle(["Barbara",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

!battle(["Oprah",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

!battle(["Amy",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

!battle(["Olga",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

As soon as you get to the first healing star, grab the *Focus Sash* to the left and press the button on the pillar.

!battle(["Huey",:OPTKID_1,0], "Dimensional Field")

!battle(["Ursula",:SERVANT,0], "Blessed Field")

!battle(["Reina",:TRENDYGIRL_1,0], "Dimensional Field")

Another easy one, just make sure you don't get swept by Honchkrow.

Head up and through, grabbing the *Code Angelus Rift Notes*. Oh boy...

!boss("ANGELOFDEATH", "Dimensional Field")

This is a very tough battle. It has FOUR shields, meaning you have to deplete its HP five times. On top of this is its Rift Ralts and Rift Kirlia reinforcements that have doubles-oriented moves like Quash, Poison Gas, and Helping Hand to make things more difficult. Gardevoir's moveset changes at each phase, providing it a massive array of coverage on both the physical and special side. It even gets a massive nuke of a Z-Move in its last phase.

It doesn't have a way to counter any status conditions or stat drops of yours however. Instead of going all in on attacks, you'll need to consider debuffs. Thunder Wave as well as Flash, Screech, Fake Tears are all TMs we have at this point in time, so you can use some combination of them to wear it out then let a couple strong attackers in your party's back take out each health bar.

!partner(["Ren",:OUTCAST,1])

!boss("FALLENANGEL", "Dimensional Field")

Not tough compared to the previous fight, thankfully.

Once you get control back, head to Nymiera's house once again. Push the button on the back of the bookcase!

Back in Sashila, head out to the Zorrialyn Coast and go up past the Braviary Post to the Field of Pillars. Talk to Alexandra in front of the obelisk. After the scene, we're gonna head west across the bridge for a battle with Ren! At least we're familiar with his team.

!battle(["Ren",:OUTCAST,0], "Desert Field")

A very, very tough singles battle, in no small part thanks to Protean Greninja. Changing STAB on the fly with one of the best speed stats in the game makes it a very tough opponent. On top of this is Aevian Roserade, Flygon, and Corviknight, all immune to the Desert Field's Sandstorm chip, plus Arcanine and Silvally for hard hitting coverage. Take advantage of priority moves to deal with Greninja and utilize the field to your advantage to win this one.

## Sashila Village Help Quests

It's time for some Help Quests. Enter the door in the middle of Sashila Village, on the left side.

### Legend of the Void

Enter a house above the help center and talk to Marten. Enter the left house towards the bottom of the village next to talk to Hyu'ro. Return to Marten. Exit, and take the Mudsdale rider outside the village to Voidal Chasm.

In the Voidal Chasm, return to near where we entered and pick up the shiny object.

Return to Marten, then meet him in Hyu'ro's house. Enter Sashila's research room to the left of Marten's house. Talk to Marten at the top. Head into Alexandra's room and use the crystal to go back to the past...

Talk to the truck driver in Hiyoshi City and go to Gregorian Lake. Surf up and talk to the guy inside the house here to get a *Lake Postcard*.

Return to the present and talk to Hyu'ro. After talking to Marten at the door, head back to the Voidal Chasm. In the chasm, you will then have to battle an **Absol**! Hyu'ro's fate is up to you. After making your choice, return to Sashila. Re-enter the research area and talk to Marten.

Return to the help center to claim your reward: $12,500 and the *Absolite*! (+1 Karma)

### Badland Baddies

Head back to the research center from the last quest. Talk to the guy at the bottom right and agree to get sprayed.

Head east from the Zorrialyn Coast.

!enc(523)

Grab the hidden *Red Shard*. Upstairs, Vileplume will try to put you to sleep and fail! Enter this first house and use Blast Powder within to reach a *Relic Copper* and:

**ZCell 120: Fort Rystrine**

!img("zcell120.png")

Back outside, grab a hidden *Ground Gem*, *Sun Stone*, and *Super Repel*. Inside the building in the upper left is a *Rare Candy*. Smash the rock and push the boulder to enter a room on the left where you can find a *Relic Copper* as well as:

**ZCell 121: Fort Rystrine**

!img("zcell121.png")

On the roof, you can catch **Wimpod (Aevian)**!

Towards the right side of the area is a hidden *Green Shard*. Enter the building towards the center of the area to get a *Relic Silver*. Outside, go down to get hidden *Calcium*, *Wacan Berry*, *Protein*, and *Super Repel*. Head inside the bottom building when you are ready.

!dbattle(["Evans",:XENGRUNT_M,0], ["Fleur",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Desert Field")

!dbattle(["Kyle",:XENANALYST_M,0], ["Penny",:XENANALYST_F,0], "Desert Field")

Make your choice with Damien.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Convince Damien. (Damien +2) (+1 Karma).
- Evict them. (Damien +1) (-1 Karma).

Grab the *Gothitelle Crest*, *Reuniclus Crest*, and *Rock Memory* on the way out.

Talk to Damien once more outside and watch the scene that plays out. Return to the help center to claim your reward: $22500, a *Link Heart*, *3 Sitrus Berries*, and *3 Roseli Berries* (+1 Karma).

### My Sister Fell!

Head to the Voidal Chasm. Make your way all the way through the dungeon: you'll find a girl at the bottom. Agree to leave with her.

Head west in the desert, and Rock Climb as soon as possible. You'll see Mandibuzz and the girl on top of a rock climb. Beat Mandibuzz.

Go all the way back to Zorrialyn Coast, and you'll see the Exeggutor by the Braviary Post and pond.

Return to the help center to get $32500 and MegaStone *Abomasite* (+1 Karma)!

### I Need to Get Stronger!

Meet Novae at the bottom of the village. It's battle time...

!battle(["Novae",:WANDERER,3], "Desert Field")

Compared to some of her earlier fights, this isn't that bad. She uses a standard desert-based sun team, meant to catch your leads off guard with powerful Heat Wave and anti-priority. If you can change up the weather, you'll be golden. Alternatively, fighting Fire with Fire works well here, as only her own Ninetales and the frail Lycanroc resist your own Heat Wave.

Return to the help center to get $32500 and a *Scented Lure*. (+1 Karma).

## Sand Stream Cave

You can return to GDC now if you want, but there's even more desert exploration and quests we can do!

Next, we're gonna enter Sand Stream Cave at the top left corner of Zorrialyn Desert West.

!enc(513)

Grab the *Hyper Potion* up here. Hidden in this first room is *2 Yellow Shards*, *Carbos*, *Escape Rope*, *Berry Juice*, and *Grass Gem*.

In order to proceed in the cave, we need a bit of luck: there needs to be stationary Hippopotas roaming the first floor. Exit and re-enter until this condition is met. 

Enter any vortex to reach B1F. There are **Hippowdon** roaming around down here! Jump into the vortex in the sand pit to reach B2F. Grab the *Revive* here on B2F and find a hidden *Red Shard*, then another *Revive* and hidden *Green Shard* and *Rare Candy* past some Rock Climbs. In the center of the room is a hidden *Light Clay*. Grab the *Full Heal*, hidden *Burn Heal*, *Clever Wing*, and *Genius Wing* along the way, plus a *Moon Ball* in the southeast. Take the central vortex to B3F!

!enc(514)

Interact with the space in the ground here and put in the Scented Lure. Then, you'll be able to catch **Trapinch** and **Vibrava**! 

Hidden in this room is a *Green Shard*, *Soft Sand*, *Rock Gem*, *Rawst Berry*, *Sitrus Berry*, *Berry Juice* and *Lava Cookie*.

At the top of the room, you'll find:

**ZCore 1: Sand Stream Cave**

Grab the *Sandacondanite* then exit the cave by climbing the ladder.

## Zorrialyn Labyrinth 1st Visit

Next, we're going to do some treasure hunting. Towards the bottom of Zorrialyn Coast is the entrance to the Zorrialyn Labyrinth. It costs $5500 per trip: we will be booted from the dungeon after a certain number of steps, meaning completion requires multiple trips. Try not to stray too much from the listed paths: there is a bit of wiggle room but not much.

## Route 10

Talk to Damien at the top of Sashila and head back to Route 9. There, you'll get *HM02 Fly*! Finally. If you have the Golden Wings you can use these now!

Next, we'll visit a short new route. Just above the breeder on Route 9, head up and right. We can't do anything there yet except catch some Pokemon.

!enc(87, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

You can also catch the overhead **Wingull** and **Pelipper**!

Pick up *TM74 Gyro Ball*. That's it for Route 10. 

A few more quick things to get on Terrial Island: head over to Oblitus Town via Route 7. Talk to the PokeFlute in Kelvin's house and the top and agree to buy it for $45000. Make your way back to the northern clearing of Route 10 if you completed the Yui's Ranch quest and use the flute to catch **Snorlax**!

Next, head over to Route 8. You can use Strength on the metal poles to knock off all the Pokemon on the wire, including new **Scyther** and **Hawlucha**! 

## Neo Gearen City & Help Quests

Fly to Evergreen Forest, and head up. Rock Climb here, then use Strength to get to the top. Here, you'll find an *Ice Memory* and have a chance to catch **Sneasel**! Towards the top of the area, surf across a pond, climb some rocks and use Strength again to pick up MegaStone *Audinite*! Make your way to the spring. Battle and catch "The Emperor"
(**Empoleon**). Back outside the forest, talk to Nana in her house for a *King's Rock*!

Head to North Evergreen Cave. Melt the ice again with a move like Lava Plume to get to the top. Push the boulder into this hole. On the next floor, you need to push it into the rightmost hole... unfortunately this is the farthest one away. On the next floor, navigate it all the way around to the hole on the bottom. Once you push it down, follow it. Fish in this newly opened spot to catch **Feebas**!

Next, fly to Kakori, and head down to the depths of the gym. Using strength in the backroom, you'll get *TM106 Irritation*.

In Terajuma Jungle, If you've picked up the T.M.'s for Hail, Sunny Day, and Rain Dance, show them to the guy in front of the weather institute to get the *Castform Crest* and *TM128 Weather Ball*.

Enter Aquamarine Cave next: in the chamber room, surf up and talk to **Squirtle**. Give it a GourmetTreat for a battle.

Go to Kristiline Town next. The T.M. shop has updated wares:

Kristiline T.M. Shop New Items (12+ Badges)

|Item                 |Price  |
|---------------------|-------|
|*RM01 Hone Claws*    |$150000|

|*TM125 Charm*        |$15000 |
|*TM155 Eerie Impulse*|$15000 |

Next, we're heading to Lost Camp. If you've completed all three parts of this quest so far, enter Maman's house and go upstairs. After some scenes, you'll get **Starly**, and (+999 Mosely) Relationship Points. Yes, seriously.

Enter the Locksmith's house in Akuwa Town. Show him our broken key. If you have 2 Light Clay and 1 Hard Stone, he'll make us a *Reforged Key*! Nice. Fly back to Sashila and attempt to enter the house on the coastline. Hidden on the first floor is a *Yellow Shard, Blue Shard*, and a *Red Shard*. Head upstairs and talk to the girl and pick up a hidden *Poke Doll*. Interact with the hook downstairs and place the family portrait. Then, head around to the left and go downstairs to get MegaStone *Gardevoirite*.

Fly to Goldenleaf Town and enter Wispy Ruins through the statue. Head into the 4-way junction and go right, then, push the strength boulder onto the platform. Enter, and follow the path up to the 9-badge gate. Talk to the treasure chest for a battle with **Gastly**!

Enter the Lost Castle and make your way straight to the back. If you've opened all 9 of the badge gate chests, head in to get the *Vespiquen Crest*, and *TM61 Will-o-Wisp*.

Next, head to Wispy Tower. Head around the back via Strength to get *Reaper Cloth*!

Exit, and make your way to Sheridan Village. Enter Carotos via the waterfall entrance and make your way to the second room. Cross the bridge to the right, use Blast Powder, and use strength to get beyond.

Carotos Pokemon Seller

| Pokemon               | Price         |
|-----------------------|---------------|
|**Happiny**            |6 Blue Shards  |
|**Joltik**             |6 Yellow Shards|
|**Charmander**         |10 Red Shards  |
|Furfrou                |8 Yellow Shards|
|"Pikachu" (**Mimikyu**)|7 Yellow Shards|

Buy all of them to get *Fire Memory* and (+5 Karma).

Head to the Amethyst Grotto. Using Strength, get *TM22 Solarbeam*.

Next, fly to Rose Theater and use the Time Splicer Stone. Head to Sheridan Village, then cut down the pink sapling in front of the village. Make your way back to the present.

Next, we're gonna fly to West Gearen City. Head into the house with the red door on the south side of town. If you've beat all the virtual gym leaders, accept the challenge to the virtual E4. You can "take a break" after each win: if you do, you can save between each member.

    -   Heat Wave
    -   Solarbeam
    -   Psychic

I again will cover this as on the Cyndaquil path. This one isn't too bad, though in general you must watch out for field boosted Psychic. A bit of luck in dodging sleep allows Typhlosion to knock out Jynx and Exeggutor, and Miltank and Jolteon can easily handle Espeon, Slowbro, and Slowking with a combination of healing and attacking. The rest of your Pokemon should be able to fill in the gaps.

Elite Four Koga (Glitch Field)
-   Forretress, Level 53. @ Zoom Lens.
    -   Toxic Spikes
    -   Spikes
    -   Zap Cannon

-   Crobat, Level 56. @ Leftovers.
    -   Toxic
    -   Double Team
    -   Roost
    -   Heat Wave

It can be very tempting to start setting up Curse with Steelix, but Koga has a lot of Fire / Water special coverage, so you probably want to Stealth Rock then bail. Keeping Qwilfish alive is useful to nullify all Toxic Spikes here, unfortunately it doesn't really help much other than setting up your own spikes if you want to cripple Muk, Qwilfish, and Ariados. Luckily Jolteon can easily take Crobat if you don't let it Double Team too much, and Typhlosion, Gliscor, and Steelix can find ways to deal with everything else easily.

Elite Four Bruno (Glitch Field)
-   Golem, Level 54. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Rock Polish
    -   Metronome
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Earthquake
-   Granbull, Level 55. @ Leftovers.
    -   Lovely Kiss
    -   Return
    -   Fire Blast
    -   Metronome
-   Kangaskhan, Level 54. @ Metronome.
    -   Blizzard
    -   Fire Blast
    -   Hyper Beam
    -   Power Up Punch
-   Hitmonchan, Level 56. @ Expert Belt.
    -   Drain Punch
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Ice Punch

    -   Metronome

-   Machamp, Level 57. @ Payapa Berry.
    -   Metronome
    -   Dynamic Punch
    -   Stone Edge
    -   Fire Blast

The good news is, a lot of his team centers around Metronome, so this might be the easiest fight yet. The bad news is, his team centers around Metronome, which only picks strong moves on this field! So, you might be extremely *unlucky*. Gliscor is a good choice to wear out the fighting types, as well as Golem. Steelix is useless other than Stealth Rocks here unfortunately. Miltank and Jolteon are a bit less useful but can still help by crippling Granbull and Kangaskhan. Once Gliscor goes down, Qwilfish with Intimidate and Typhlosion should be able to ride out the fight.

Elite Four Karen (Glitch Field)
-   Alolan Persian, Level 55. @ Mental Herb.
    -   Nasty Plot
    -   Bite
    -   Seed Bomb
    -   Thunder
-   Honchkrow, Level 56. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Steel Wing
    -   Aerial Ace
    -   Curse
    -   Roost
-   Tyranitar, Level 57. @ Passho Berry.
    -   Blizzard
    -   Thunder
    -   Fire Blast
    -   Dark Pulse
-   Vileplume, Level 55. @ Miracle Seed.
    -   Nature Power
    -   Sleep Powder
    -   Energy Ball
    -   Infestation
-   Houndoom, Level 57. @ Lum Berry.
    -   Fire Blast
    -   Laser Focus
    -   Super Fang
    -   Throat Chop
-   Umbreon, Level 58. @ Leftovers.
    -   Rest
    -   Sleep Talk
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Toxic

This one is tough! Two Gyro Balls will knock out Persian luckily, and Miltank can barely take out Tyranitar. Vileplume goes down to Typhlosion, and if you save Gliscor for Houndoom, you can one-shot it. Unfortunately, the Umbreon is a pain in the ass to take out - I recommend Knocking Off its item with Gliscor and using everything you have left to make sure it can't rest. Steelix can't get poisoned, so getting off a couple curses might be your best bet. You can always reset if things go south.

Champion Lance (Glitch Field)
-   Alolan Exeggutor, Level 58. @ White Herb.
    -   Draco Meteor
    -   Giga Drain
    -   Dragon Hammer
    -   Hyper Beam
-   Arcanine, Level 57. @ Power Herb.
    -   Dig
    -   Fire Blast
    -   Extreme Speed
    -   Hyper Beam
-   Aerodactyl, Level 57. @ Normal Gem.
    -   Aerial Ace
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Hone Claws
    -   Hyper Beam
-   Lapras, Level 58. @ Iapapa Berry.
    -   Blizzard
    -   Future Sight
    -   Whirlpool
    -   Hyper Beam
-   Charizard, Level 58. @ Charcoal.
    -   Fire Blast
    -   Wing Attack
    -   Earthquake
    -   Blast Burn
-   Dragonite, Level 60. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Agility
    -   Outrage
    -   Fire Blast
    -   Hyper Beam

A fitting challenge to end this quest! Exeggutor can two shot pretty much your whole team, Aerodactyl can get a free knock out with Glitch Field Hyper Beam, and his other Pokemon have immense coverage. The good news: everything past his lead is weak to stealth rocks! So, use Steelix to get those out, then let Jolteon hit Exeggutor and Dragonite with 4x effective Hidden Power. Qwilfish helped me weaken Lapras and Gliscor finished it, leaving Miltank and Typhlosion to carefully deal with the rest of the team. It's tough, but you can do it.

If you succeed, you'll get the corresponding crest to your starter in the challenge: the *Meganium Crest*, *Typhlosion Crest*, or *Feraligatr Crest*! You'll also get 25 AP Points and your fourth department store stamp!

On Junction Bridge, push a boulder out of the way - now that we have the Dull Key, open the door here and use a GourmetTreat to get **Litten**!

Next, head east through Neo Gearen City (I'll cover this revamped area later!) to Route 2.

Route 2 (Altered)

On the left you'll find a hidden *Rose Incense*.

Enter the factory in the middle of the route to get a *Grass Memory* as well as *Research Notes*. Exit through the left door and grab the *Dusk Stone* and hidden *Blue Shard* and *Rare Candy*.

You'll also find:

ZCell 094: Route 2 (Altered)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image97.png"/>

Return to the past again and give the guy on Route 2 some research notes so he'll finally move out of the way. At night only, you can get:

ZCell 095: Route 2

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image98.png"/>

Also, you can catch **Whimsicott** here (ignore the Flabebe from an earlier patch).

Talk to Kecleon in the middle of the route. He'll offer to sell the two crests that correspond to the starters we did NOT choose in the virtual league. He'll sell the *Meganium Crest, Typhlosion Crest*, and *Feraligatr Crest* for $250000 each. Steep, but worth it if you are using any of these three and didn't get their crest via the virtual league quest.

As you've probably noticed, East Gearen City looks brand new. Fly there!

There are new trainers to fight and items on each map. The one containing the lab has a hidden *GourmetTreat, Yellow Shard, Resist Wing, Elemental Seed, Super Potion, Red Shard*, and 2 *Grass Gems*. The right contains a *Resist Wing, Heart Scale, Tiny Mushroom, Repel*, and *Antidote*.

Enter the lab and talk to Jan. Then, head outside and talk to Adrienn again.

Enter the sewers with Adrienn. Hidden on this map is 2 *Red Shards*, 2 *Blue Shards, Zinc, Potion*. Follow Adrienn into the next room, and pick up the hidden *Blue Shard* and *Green Shard*. Next, go to the upper right room.

Emerge on the east side of Gearen and meet Adrienn and Aya in the middle of the city.

We have our new directive: help quests. Before that though, check out Gearen Park if you want.

Gearen Park (Neo)

Hidden here is 2 *Honey, Leaf Stone, Carbos, Muscle Wing, Blue Shard*, and *Yellow Shard*.

Catch a Level 100 Budew (or catch something close and Rare Candy it to 100). Then, show it to the guy at the bottom for ZCrystal *Grassium-Z*.

Speaking of Budew, add Aevian Budew to your party and head up to the library. Upstairs, talk to Zumi, who will reward us with 10 *Exp. Candy L* and MegaStone *Ampharosite*! Our final task for her is to catch a Pokemon found later on at Axis University.

Enter the Help Center. If you've been keeping track of Zygarde Cells (At least 70), talk to the researchers to get *Lucky Egg*!

### HQuest 32: Poke Ball Conundrum Enter the Everglade Mall and speak to the clerk at the Poke Ball shop.

Attempt to enter the door at the Tecanlite Factory in West Gearen. Head down, and Aya will let you in.

Beat the goons at the entrance. Pick up all the balls you see around!

Enter the door towards the left of the floor and get the *Tecanlite Key*. Use it on the door at the top to pick up *TM24 Thunderbolt*!

Back in the main area, use the Key at the top of the floor, then follow the path through to the right. Beat the Death Wings - they  use exclusively Steel and Water types.

Return to the Help Center to get your reward - $12356, and ZCrystal *Aloraichium-Z*. (+1 Karma)

Now, return to the Poke Ball shop to get 15 *Ultra Balls*. We'll also again be able to buy balls here - nothing we couldn't before however.

### HQuest 33: Forest Restoration Meet at the Route 1 Train Station.

Talk to Adrienn in front of where we fought Gyarados (remember that?)

We're gonna need to submit 3 workers, 1 Scyther, and $48000. Go ahead and submit the money when you have it.

Fly to Kakori Village and enter the Jeminra Woods Safari Zone. You'll see **Scyther** here now, so catch two (one to keep).

To find the people:
- Worker 1: Community room in Goldenleaf Town.
- Worker 2: Xen Battleship at the Terajuma shore, right person in sleeping chambers.
- Worker 3: House below therapist in Kristiline Town.

Return to Adrienn and hand over the Scyther, then ask to see Progress.

We're gonna need $58000, 1 Architect, and 3 Fishermen. Submit the money.

To find the three people:
- Fisherman 1: On a bench east of the East Gearen to Route 1 Station.
- Fisherman 2: On Route 2, directly south of the Amethyst Cave entrance.
- Fisherman 3: In Aquamarine Cave, via the lighthouse path. While you're in the Rock Climb area, talk to the worker and give him Protein. If you do, he will give you **Tyrogue** (+1 Karma)! Anyways, you'll find the fisherman after you go up the ladder.
- Architect: Bridge guy in Terajuma Jungle - first left from Kakori.

Return to Adrienn and inquire about progress.

Next, we'll need to submit $68000, 7 Tiny Mushrooms, 1 bag of Stardust, and 1 Poliwag.

If you haven't completed the Poliwag search quest, do so now. Feel free to submit that one if you have it, or, if its evolved, breed it. Note that finishing this quest will let us catch more Poliwag, so don't worry if this is your only one.

I had both the mushrooms and the stardust, but if not, go grind them off Paras/Staryu, respectively. Compoundeyes and Thief/Covet will make your hunt quicker.

Submit it all to Adrienn.

Talk to Adrienn at the top. Beat the Deathwing.

Return to Grand Hall and talk to Adrienn. Enter the basement and take a right.

After the scene, exit this room and enter the room on the right at the bottom, and grab ZCrystal *Normalium-Z*.

Return to the help center to get (back) $250000, and MegaStone *Mawilite*. (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 34: Mall Opportunities Head to the mall and meet the girl at the very top. Donate $30000 to her... Then talk to her in the shop to get *Occa Berry*.

Give her 5 Occa Berries after either farming them or using the stash we bought earlier. You'll get a *Passho Berry*. Either farm four more or put off this quest until we get our next department store stamp, when we'll be able to buy more.

Talk to ICSW again, then head to the berry store downstairs. Re-enter the ice cream shop. Then, enter the restaurant next door. After exiting,  head to Terajuma Shore.

On the west end by the lighthouse, talk to the grunt. After getting paid off, return to the restaurant.

Then, talk to the officer downstairs.

Talk to ICSW again, then talk to Aya in the lab center.

Return to the help center to get $25840 and MegaStone *Altarianite*. (+1 Karma).

After doing all three quests, head over to Venam's gym to fight Aya.

This can be a scary battle: Lycanroc is guaranteed one turn of safety plus an attack boost. If you can knock that out, the defensive core of Mega Venusaur, Tentacruel, and Dragalge are all intense! The good news is there isn't really anything preventing you from decimating her team with Earthquake, so if you can knock out Lycanroc and slow down Tentacruel somehow you might be able to sweep from there.

Fly over to Sashila Village. Now there is a new move tutor!

One more quest we can do. Head to Oblitus Town. If you've done the Yui's ranch quest, enter Kelvin's house on the right side of town and get the *PokeFlute* for $45000. Then, go to Honec Woods where **Snorlax** is to get it.

## Route 4 Thirteen Badge Update

Next is a quick detour to Route 4 to get some new Den Pokemon - feel free to skip this one as well.

Essentially, now that we've beaten Souta, all four of the dens have been updated with new Pokemon! So, I will list the Pokemon in each here.

RIFT DEN 1 (12 - 16 Badges): The common encounters in this den are **Rockruff**, Shiftry, **Reuniclus**, Solosis, Tropius, Sigilyph, Dhelmise. The rare ones are Relicanth, Persian, Lumineon, Sudowoodo, Lanturn.

RIFT DEN 2 (12 - 16 Badges): The common encounters in this den are Unfezant, **Wailord**, Dunsparce, Mandibuzz, Masquerain, Quagsire, Togedemaru. The rare ones are Chatot, Snorunt, Glalie, Cacnea, Cacturne, Claydol, **Klefki**.

RIFT DEN 3 (12 - 16 Badges): The common encounters in this den are Stoutland, Crabrawler, Pachirisu, Chimecho, Stunfisk, **Kadabra**, Mankey. The rare ones are Rhydon, Vanilluxe, Vanillish, Purugly, Ditto, Ursaring.

RIFT DEN 4 (12 - 16 Badges): The common encounters in this den are Lombre, Gastrodon, **Seismitoad**, Swanna. The rare ones are Mantine, **Jellicent**, **Timburr**.

Entering Cairo's shop, he has even more available crests now!

Cairo's Shop New Items (13 Badges)

|Item             |Price            |
|-----------------|-----------------|
|*Boltund Crest*  |9000 Red Essences|
|*Probopass Crest*|9000 Red Essences|
|*Swalot Crest*   |9000 Red Essences|
|*Cinccino Crest* |9000 Red Essences|

Head up towards Den 4. You'll spot **Sobble** hiding in the water. Chase it a few times for a battle!

Make sure you have 15000 Red Essence, then fly to Secret Shore, and head to the left. You'll notice a strength boulder across the water - push it out of the way, and you'll find a special den. Put in 15000 Red Essence and a Rift Matter, and you'll be able to battle **Beldum**! It has two shields. Just make sure you don't kill it or let it Take Down itself to death. When you catch it, your reward will be *Xen Waste*. Note that this is a special shadow Pokemon and needs to enter the Purify Chamber in the PC such that all 9 of the slots have perfect "flow" in order to be purified. Easiest way to do this is to stick 36 normal types in.




## Grand Dream Tournament

When you're ready, hop on the Route 9 train headed to the Tournament Stadium. Enter the building. Talk to Erin at the desk, then to the attendant.

GDC Tournament Shop

|Item           |Price|
|---------------|-----|
|*Poke Ball*    |$200 |
|*Great Ball*   |$600 |

|*Repel*        |$350 |
|*Super Repel*  |$500 |
|*Max Repel*    |$700 |

Head in and into the door on the left. When you're ready, talk to the guy at the right. We'll be playing a 3v3 tournament. Each battle, minus the last, will be played on a random field. So, that's interesting. The trainers aren't too hard to beat, but so you're aware of their strategies, here they are:
-   Rain Team
-   FEAR/Sturdy Shenanigans
-   Extreme Evo-boost -\> Pass -\> Stored Power

You'll then get to play as Melia for a quick second. Head into the Grand Dream Ball.

The next 3 battles are as follows:
-   Standard heavy offense with a Z-move
-   Residual damage/stall
-   Fast and hard damage

After some scenes, you'll get a treat from Tesla.

The next set of battles:
-   Nothing special
-   Nothing special: Salazzle Edition

So, beat all eight of these fools and watch the following cutscene...

    -   Matrix Shot

Matrix Shot: Rock \| Physical \| 90 power \| 100% accuracy \| Uses the target's Special Defense stat instead of the Defense stat in the damage calculation.

The Tyranitar is a tank on this field. Basically, it turns Normal type, and all its moves are turned to Normal type as well, adding to their damage. That, plus its single weakness now being Ghost, you're gonna struggle with killing it. His Kabutops is also tough to beat if it gets a Weak Armor speed boost. Otherwise, it's not the hardest battle in the world if you can account for the Inverse Field. Fire moves hit everything except Crustle and Tyranitar super effectively here - just watch out for the X-Scissor and Slash and Burn moves here and there. I also recommend using your own Magical Seeds - it will turn even type-disadvantaged mons into super-effective titans, crushing with Normalized moves.

Win to get the Rugged Badge, which lets us use Dive and go up to Level 85. You'll also get *TM80 Rock Slide*. Nice.
