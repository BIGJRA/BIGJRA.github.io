# Chapter 6: Nimpossible Predicament

Start by heading down to Terajuma Beach, then talking to Nim on the right.

!battle(["Geara",:XENEXECUTIVE_3,3], "Beach Field")

How did Geara level up/evolve his Pokemon in the altered dimension and get a Krookodile? Who knows? Anyways, this is another very difficult fight with Geara. This will be a theme with this guy. His Pokemon generally have weaknesses to Steel and Water, at least?

Once the scenes are over, you'll be taken to the Ranger HQ. Go up here and watch the transmission! Afterwards, we finally get *HM03 Surf*! Nice.

We're first going to go to Jynnobi Pass for reasons that will become clear in a bit. Head up to the Mynori Sea and go surfing. For now, simply make a beeline to the upper right side of the water and go right to proceed to Jynnobi Pass.

Talk to the Noctowl Statue to activate it. Head into the Pokemon Center to get the *Good Rod*! This is very important... because now I can list areas that have Surfing and Good Rod encounters at the same time! Muahaha! That means:

Up some stairs to the left is a shop where you can exchange your Bike Voucher for a *Bicycle*! With some new wheels and new encounter capabilities, we have some exploration and quests to take care of! 

## Terajuma Island Surfing

Start by going left, back to the Mynori Sea. First, I note that there is a new Move Tutor in Luck's Tent.

!tutor("Marvin Move Tutor", [["Super Fang", "3 Red Shards"], ["Trick", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Dual Chop", "3 Green Shards"], ["Helping Hand", "3 Yellow Shards"], ["Giga Drain", "3 Yellow Shards"], ["Synthesis", "3 Green Shards"], ["Magnet Rise", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Uproar", "3 Red Shards"], ["Telekinesis", "2 Green Shards"]])

!enc(299, ["Surfing", "Fishing"], ["Good"])

In the top right of the area, you can battle **Corsola**! To the left at night though... you can battle **Galarian Corsola**. Even better.

Enter the Jirukala Cavern to the left. Surf to the right to grab a hidden *Rock Gem*, then emerge on the left side and get *TM144 Cross Poison*.

From here, surf west onto Route 5.

!enc(301, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

!battle(["Stacy",:AROMALADY,0], "Beach Field")

!battle(["Neville",:FISHERMAN,0], "Beach Field")

Grab *TM130 Sand Tomb* and a hidden *Star Piece* above. That's all we can do here, for now. Head back to Kakori Village, then down into the Terajuma Jungle.

!enc(210, ["Surfing", "Fishing"], ["Good"], "Terajuma Jungle / Deep Terajuma Jungle")

Nothing else other than encounters to do on this map yet, so go down into the Terajuma Shipyard next. 

!enc(207, ["Surfing", "Fishing"], ["Good"], "Terajuma Shipyard / Terajuma Beach")

Surf to the right from the southwest dock:

**ZCell 037: Terajuma Shipyard**

!img("zcell037.png")

Grab the *Red Shard* below. On an island at the bottom is *TM76 Struggle Bug*. That's it for this map right now, so head up, left, then down again to enter the Terajuma Beach. Talk to the Noctowl Statue right here to unlock another fast travel location. 

Go up, then up again to enter the Deep Terajuma Jungle. Surf down from the construction house to reach a hidden *Stardust* and:

**ZCell 038: Deep Terajuma Jungle**

!img("zcell038.png")

Proceed to the upper left to enter *Deeper* Terajuma Jungle. Head north to the Tyluric Temple and go inside.

## Tyluric Temple 2

!enc(179, ["Surfing", "Fishing"], ["Good"])

Basculin. Head to the right and go up the stairs to continue *Tantalizing Temple*.

!enc(181, nil, ["Old", "Good"], "Tyluric Temple (Upper Levels)")

Once you emerge on the Upper Level for the second time, start using the itemfinder. You'll find hidden *Berry Juice*, *Sitrus Berry*, and past some cyclones, a *Funnel Cake*. Wild **Slakoth** hang out here, too.

Surf down from the door to continue. Grab the hidden *Sitrus Berry*, *Mago Berry*, and *Liechi Berry*. Continue on.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- I'm not afraid. (+1 Flora, +1 Florin, +3 Talon)
- Hell no. (+1 Florin, +2 Flora, -2 Talon)

Once you wake up, go down, then right. Interact with the mural at the top of the room. Once the cyclones are spawned, step on each one of them until the large cyclone at the top is formed. Go up it.

In this next room, talk to each mirror such that the ball of electricity generated by stepping on the tile reaches the top wall. Talk to the mural.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- How petty... (+2 Talon, +1 Florin)
- I would do the same. (+1 Talon, +2 Florin)
- This is boring me to tears. (-2 Talon, -1 Florin)

Talk to the mural in the next room. Backtrack to the upper level, surf up, and go left. Step on the cyclone on the roof. From here, go left and grab the hidden *Leaf Stone* and *Oran Berry*. Head down and left, then enter the door.

!boss("RIFTCARNIVINE", "Grassy Terrain")

This is a wacky boss fight. Carnivine has three forms, each with a four times weakness - to Ice, then Fire twice, though it holds berries to nullify them in two forms. It switches around its and also your stat boosts at each phase as well, making it hard to pin down. The Tangela and Tangrowth it spawns are particularly annoying as well - they have moves like Follow Me and Quash that try to force you out of attacking Carnivine. 

Immediate Paralysis makes it much easier to deal with, since a Pokemon with moderate speed using one of said super-effective moves might be able to one-shot it. That's it for this quest, right now!

## Jynnobi Pass

In full this time, we head to Jynnobi Pass. Back in the Mynori Sea, surf to the right to reach it.

!enc(173, nil, ["Old", "Good"])

Talk to the girl up the stairs at the bottom to begin *A Souvenir For Mom* quest. Fly with Noctowl over to Terajuma Beach during the daytime. Talk to the man up the stairs to the left, then return to Jynnobi to give the souvenir to the girl. Unfortunately, she doesn't like this one, so we'll have to continue this quest later.

To the right:

**ZCell 039: Jynnobi Pass**

!img("zcell039.png")

Even more to the right:

**ZCell 040: Jynnobi Pass**

!img("zcell040.png")

Grab *TM145 Hex* nearby. Head up the stairs to the left and talk to the group.

Back inside the house in Kakori, talk to Melia. Say April Berry Moose Cake.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Definitely not. (+2 Aelita, +2 Adam, +2 Melia, +2 Valarie)
- Sitting can be fun. (+1 Adam, +1 Aelita, -1 Melia, -2 Valarie)

## Mt. Terajuma

Fly over to Terajuma Beach then go up into the Deep Terajuma Jungle. Activate this Noctowl Statue, then prepare for a fight. This one does not need to be won.

!boss("TAPUKOKOJUNGLE", "Forest Field")

Not the hardest boss we've had to face yet, thankfully. Proceed to the next map, surf across the stream up the stairs, and enter the cave.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Is this the only way? (Neutral)
- Maybe if we wait? (Neutral)
- This is so stupid. (-1 Melia)
- This is your fault. (-2 Melia if current Melia Pts > 5 else -3 Melia, -2 Aelita)

!enc(174, ["Grass"])

I recommend catching a Nincada and evolving it to get a Shedinja. It's helpful in a game like this... and for finally beating a certain trainer in East Gearen in a bit. Grab the hidden *Elemental Seed*.

Anyways, head back outside and cross the bridge. After a scene, enter this door. Get the hidden *Nest Ball* and *Max Repel*. Use the lift on the left. Outside, follow the path and grab the hidden *PP Up* and *Green Shard*. Look through the binoculars if you wish. Jump down into the left tile of the water specifically. Grab the *5 Exp. Candy L*, *Heart Scale*, and *Red Shard* as well as hidden *Green Shard*, and mine some rocks. Get a hidden *Hyper Potion* below, then go back up the lift. Jump down the rightmost water tile. Pick up the hidden *Red Shard*.

!battle(["Demetra",:XENGRUNT_F,0], "Cave Field")

Climb the next lift and exit into Mt. Terajuma!

!enc(295)

There are also **Aevian Snorunt** to the right! Very nice.

Grab the hidden *Revival Herb*, *Green Shard*, *Clever Wing*, *Resist Wing*, *Muscle Wing*, *TinyMushroom*, and *Exp. Candy M* as you go right. Behind another Aevian Snorunt is a hidden *Rare Candy*. Continuing, grab a hidden *Rock Gem*, *Exp. Candy L* and *Ether*.

Talk to the Noctowl Statue to create another fly location. Enter the Weather Institute.

!battle(["Gina",:XENGRUNT_F,0])

!battle(["Georgie",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

!battle(["Mac",:XENGRUNT_M,0])

!battle(["Shino",:XENANALYST_F,0])

Back outside, go down some of the stairs but go right. You'll see another cave here. The left lift is a shortcut back down to the jungle - take the right one instead. Follow this path out when you are ready.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- They're a lost cause. (+1 Aelita, +1 Melia)
- You're overreacting. (-1 Aelita, -2 Melia)
- We should calm down... (+2 Aelita, +1 Melia)

You get to choose to fight Neved or Zetta here.

!battle(["Neved",:XENEXECUTIVE_4,1], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Zetta",:XENEXECUTIVE_1,5], "Forest Field")

Neither fight should be too difficult at this point: neither has particular field synergy. Once you win, talk to Rorim B below. Take the cable car down, then talk to Aelita in the squad house.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- I'm sure she's fine. (+1 Aelita)
- Do we really have to? (-2 Aelita)
- I agree. (+2 Aelita)

Use Noctowl to reach Terajuma Beach and talk to Melia.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- We have to! (+2 Melia, +2 Saki, +2 Aelita)
- I'm not sure... (-3 Adam, -2 Valarie, -1 Melia)
- Just stay strong. (+3 Adam, +2 Valarie)

Talk to Crawli in his office, and accept the fast travel to the shipyard.

Make sure you heal, then head onto the island.

Xen Executive Zetta (Ashen Beach Field)
-   Absol, Level 41. @ Blackglasses.
    -   Swords Dance
    -   Psycho Cut
    -   Night Slash
    -   Sucker Punch
-   Weavile, Level 42. @ Muscle Band.
    -   Low Kick
    -   Night Slash
    -   Ice Shard
    -   Icicle Crash
-   Typhlosion, Level 43. @ Charcoal.
    -   Nature Power
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Thunder Punch
    -   Brick Break

-   Type: Null, Level 43. @ Eviolite.
    -   Swords Dance
    -   X-Scissor
    -   Return
    -   Shadow Claw

This is an easy battle compared to Valarie. That said, watch out for Type: Null, who can live thanks to Eviolite and set up to hit you hard. Also, potentially threatening is Typhlosion, whose Nature Power turns into a +3 Attack Meditate.

After the battle, head up.

ZCell 020: Valor Shore

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image20.png"/>

Head up to Valor Mountain and watch the scene.

## Dexoy Attack

You'll be placed back in Terajuma Jungle, so return to the south entrance.

We're gonna be battling some "Dexoys" here, which are Level 45 Deoxys with Thunderbolt, Psychic, Shadow Ball, and Flash Cannon. Obviously, they're tough to take out, but in a pinch, you can find a strategy. Head to the west first, then the east.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I'm alright. (Melia +2)
- Could be worse. (Melia +1)
- Terrible. (Neutral)

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- So.. We're on our own? (Melia +1)
- Well, that sucks... (Neutral)
- Can we ask again? (Melia +2)

Enter the room to the left.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Get me out. (Melia +1)
- I have a Relic to get. (Neutral)
- A + A = B - B + 3. (Venam +2)

Now is a good time to do the help quests.

## Kakori Help Quests

### HQuest 13: Clear the Way!

Enter Terajuma Jungle and head south onto the hill and talk to the hiker. We're gonna need to find 7 black shards around the forest.

1.  Immediately right of the hiker
2.  In the map to the left, next to the stacks of wood by the Timburr
3.  Heading left across the bridge and to the left, north by the broken bridge
4.  South -\> west -\> north across the bridges from \#3
5.  North from \#4, in the meadow
6.  In the bottom left side of the map where you fought Valarie
7.  Near the water at the bottom side of the entrance map

After you've gotten them, head back to the hiker. He's now cleared the vines, so you can progress through the jungle easier!

Head into the cave in the water below, which is now opened. Grab the *TM51 Steel Wing* and *Blast Powder*.

Return to the help center to get $4326! (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 14: Bandit at Large

Head to the weather institute in the jungle. Talk to the girl near the Venusaur on the left.

Head to Route 5 and enter the empty shack on Valor Shore. We're gonna need to find the Xen grunt hiding on each floor.
-   1F: In the middle stack of books
-   2F: In the box in the upper right corner
-   2F (#2): In the books in the center
-   3F: In the trash can on the top
-   3F (#2): In the horizontal lines of the bottom right big machine
-   3F (#3): In the pot on the top left

On the fourth level, grab the *Good Rod*!

Talk to her on the fourth level, and you'll have to battle. You'll be taken back to the weather institute.

Head back to Route 5 and all the way down the ladders again to pick up another *Blast Powder*.

Return to the help center to get a **Bulbasaur** egg, a *Rare Candy*, and $5000! (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 15: Building Bridges

Head to the lumber yard in Terajuma Jungle and enter the building. Talk to the guy on the right, then Gurdurr. Head west to the bridge, and we'll have to battle.

PokeGang Conkeldurr (Forest Field)
-   Timburr, Level 25.
-   Timburr, Level 35.
-   Timburr, Level 45.
-   Timburr, Level 55.
-   Timburr, Level 65.
-   Conkeldurr, Level 75.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Ice Punch
    -   Brick Break
    -   Thunder Punch

This is another double battle with one tough enemy at the very end. Luckily, even at level 75 all the enemies are somewhat slow, so if you can boost your offenses with a somewhat fast mon you might be able to one shot it with something super effective. You can use the easy first two Timburr as an excuse to set up a lot of entry hazards and/or set up with moves like Dragon Dance. Either way, come up with a strategy to take it out.

Once you win, head west and go up to the broken bridge. Enter, then catch **Rowlet** in there. This is also where the Mossy Rock is located. Hidden is a *Red Shard* as well.

Return to the help center to get $4890 and a *Sun Stone*! (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 16: Find It!

Head to the ranger shack in the southwest corner of the jungle. Talk to Roggenrola, and it will follow you.

Exit the jungle towards Kakori, fighting AA Grunts along the way.

Heal at the Kakori Pokemon center, then talk to the guy in the top left.

After one battle, return to the help center to get $4255. (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 17: Battle Me Again!

Time for another battle with Novae. Get your best team and head to the Valor Shore.

Wanderer Novae (Ashen Beach)
-   Toucannon, Level 42. @ Yache Berry.
    -   Beak Blast
    -   Roost
    -   Bullet Seed
    -   Rock Blast
-   Vikavolt, Level 43. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Bug Buzz
    -   Air Slash
    -   Roost
-   Lycanroc, Level 45. @ Rock Gem.
    -   Stone Edge
    -   Crunch
    -   Accelerock
    -   Drill Run
-   Tsareena, Level 43. @ Grass Gem.
    -   Trop Kick
    -   Knock Off
    -   Play Rough
    -   Acrobatics
-   Palossand, Level 43. @ Leftovers.
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Shore Up
    -   Earth Power
    -   Giga Drain
-   Passimian, Level 45. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Iron Head
    -   Close Combat
    -   Brutal Swing
    -   Bulk Up

This is the hardest battle of hers yet. Almost all her Pokemon have really deep coverage! Passimian can hit hard if given the chance to bulk up even once, and Vikavolt takes lives if you let it attack. Not to mention speed demon Lycanroc probably able to take out at least one of your team members at will. Not a ton of synergy or a central strategy though. As before getting a team with near perfect synergy that counters each of her mons and you might sneak out a victory. You can also wait till the next level cap if you want to make this one easier.

Anyways, return to the help center to get $4500, 10 *Reverse Candies*, 10 *Max Repels*, and 10 *Super Potions*. (+1 Karma)

If you've done all the help quests, your reward is access to the safari zone garden. We'll get this to a bit. Enter the door that the AA grunt came out of.

You'll be entered into a 6v6 double battle, but if you can take Novae you should be able to handle this one. Grab the *TM57 Charge Beam* and the *Center Keys* here, as well as an *Exp. Candy M*.

That's it for the help quests.

Now, one more quest we can do. Enter the Xen Battleship, and the girl from earlier will be here. Talk to her, and she'll run to the deck. After you talk to her again, she'll go into the main room. Finally, follow her to the very top through Augustus' room. That's all we can do here for now, so back in Kakori, enter the house of the girl who we took to the boat, and she'll give you a *Destiny Knot*.

Now that we have the Good Rod, there are a couple new Pokemon we can obtain in these areas.

Terajuma Pier

| Good Rod        | %        |

Grab the *TM123 Self Destruct* while you're here!

We're now gonna go find Rorim B.

    -   Hidden Power Water
-   Altaria, Level 42.
    -   Dragon Dance
    -   Earthquake
    -   Dragon Claw
    -   Roost

This battle isn't really meant to be hard, and once Bellossom and Ludicolo are taken out, a good Rock Slide can clean up his whole team. You can do it! Get the *Sky Relic*.

Accept the fast travel. Talk to Rorim B, and he'll take you to the Secret Shore.

- Crawli needs our help. (Neutral)

If it is raining outside, you can find stationary Gastrodon to fight. Note that you can also find many *Absorb Bulbs* by interacting with them in this area.

A *Dusk Ball, Revive*, and a *Pearl* are hidden on the first island.

To the right, you'll see a brown book on the ground. If you gave away your *Ancient Book*, here's where you can get a new one. Otherwise, leave it here for now.

Maneuver up on the first island to where you can access the water from two points. We can't do anything from the left yet, so surf up from the right. Head to the right island and cut the tree, accessing the water on the north side of this island. Head up to the next and talk to Melia.

Surf west from here and grab the *Pretty Wing*. Head up and enter the lab.

After a cutscene, head to the west. We must do an arrow puzzle.

7.  Take the bottom left downward arrow.
8.   Go up one tile, then right. You'll fight a trainer with a shadow
    Baltoy.
9.   Return to the bottom, then get back to this area. Instead, take the
    upward arrow to the left of the trainer.
10.   Leave the blue panel alone, and head up.
11.   Press the purple panel then take the rightward arrow.
12. Ignore this pink panel and go down.
13.   Press the orange panel.
14.   Go up onto the leftward arrows onto the pink -\> blue -\> orange
    path and we're done!

There are Pokemon in here.

11.   Take the left upwards arrow that takes you to the left.
12.   Activate the pink panel and fight the grunt.
13.   Head down and activate the blue panel.
14.   Head right, up and right, then up and right to get to *TM73 Thunder
    Wave*!
15.   Head back down, left, left up, and from here return to the upper
    left region as we've done before.
16.  Instead, take the upper right upwards arrow that leads to the upper right.
17.   Take the rightwards arrow that takes you through the pink path and
    we're out.

Heal, and we're going to fight in the next room.

Another tough battle with Ren - his team is almost fully complete, with only Scyther left to evolve. His team, or at least the last four members, are extremely fast, so you must find mons that can live his attacks and dish it back. Cacturne likes to lay spikes. Be careful of technician Scyther which can hit hard, and protean Greninja as always.

Afterwards, enter the hidden cave. After a cutscene, we'll be taken back out to the entrance of the forest. Accept the fast travel to head back to Kakori.

Rorim B will now take us to Oceana Pier from Terajuma Shore for free, so now is a good time to return.

## Floria Island Surfing and Side Quests

Talk to Rorim B at Terajuma Pier, and you can return to Oceana Pier.

Talk to Dragonite in Oceana Pier. He's lost some letters, so we're going to help pick them up for it. The first is immediately up and left from it. The second is left behind some trees. The third is in the upper left corner between some dumpsters. Give them back to get a *Thunderstone*!

Talk to the woman with the cart by the Gearen City Entrance. She'll offer you a *Link Heart* for $10000. This will evolve a trade evolution for us, so I recommend grabbing it now.

Enter the Magnolia Library and talk to Zumi upstairs to get our next quest. She's looking for Pyukumuku, which we already have. She'll give us 6 *Exp. Candy M*. Our next quest is for Mareep!

Head up, and you'll get *Berry Ice Cream* from Karen. *TM118 Pin Missile* is here as well. The area beyond is Wispy Ruins, but we can't explore much as we don't have Rock Climb yet. Return to the town.

Talk to Dragonite in the square - it's lost its letters again!

The first is south of the pair of houses, in the southwest corner of the town. The second letter is on the hill south of the cemetery. The third is in the grass area at the bottom. Finally, the fourth on the hill to the right of Narcissa's house. Once we have all four, talk to Dragonite to get *TM113 Brutal Swing*!

Enter Wispy Ruins through the statue, then head into the right door. Open the 5-badge gate to get a *Cursed Candle*!

Exit and go to Route 3.

Surf up to the top, above the house, where the Golden Trees are. You'll find an **Electrike** here during the day, give it a GourmetTreat for a battle!

The door is locked for now, but we'll be back after our next badge. Surf out of here to the north to return to Goldenleaf Town and take the truck to Akuwa Town.

## Route 4 Second Visit

Enter Route 4 from Akuwa Town.

Head all the way to the entrance by Wispy Ruins. Surf up at the top of the mountain: you'll find Teddy here, the eighth of the nine *lost kids* for the Lost Camp side quest. There is also another den here!

RIFT DEN 3 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are Herdier, Crabrawler, Pachirisu, and Chimecho. The rare ones are **Rhyhorn**, Vanillite, and **Purugly**.

Head north to cross the leftmost bridge: surfing here leads us to the fourth den.

RIFT DEN 4 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are Lotad, Gastrodon, and Palpitoad. The rare ones are Mantyke and **Frillish**.

That's all that we can do here for now. You might have enough Rift Essence to grab those crests if you haven't gotten them yet.

Head back to Akuwa Town.

There's nothing to do in Akuwa Town yet, as all the people are still gone. Surf east, as you do, pick up hidden *Blast Powder, Poke Ball, Health Wing* on the islands. First, surf east to Route 11.

Hidden on the first island is a *Dire Hit*. Grab the *Red Shard*, then talk to the Xen Grunt... He wants 10 Sweet Hearts. Buy them from the Route 3 Vendor if you haven't yet, then return.

Beat the grunt, and you'll be engaged in battle with a level 40 **Jynx**!

Starting to the south, use your itemfinder on the islands to find *HP Up, Adamint Mint, Red Shard, Blue Shard, Jolly Mint*. Pick up the *Ether*. To the right, you'll find Poliwag \#3!

On the island south of here, you'll find

ZCell 028: Route 11

Anyways, grab the *Max Repel* and enter the cave on the east side here.

Catch two Sandshrew here, we are gonna trade one away in a bit. The water encounters we can access in just a little bit. Nothing else we can do here yet.

Head out, and up to Evergreen Island north of Route 11.

Talk to the Octillery here to battle them.

Attempt to enter the forest, and Nana will stop you. She'll invite you to her home, so head in. She'll give you the *Mysterious Emblem*. This will also give you access to a PC and bed, which we'll be using a lot in this section.

Grab something from the PC with Blizzard, and something with either Magnitude, Earthquake, or Bulldoze. The best choice is training a Castform to 35 for Blizzard, and any Pokemon who'll learn the Bulldoze T.M. Also, grab something with Heat Wave, Flame Burst, Lava Plume, or Eruption. Salandit from the safari zone also has one of these.

Then, surf to the cave in the middle here and use Blizzard in a battle. After the field has changed, use the ground move, and a path will open. Enter and surf to battle **Lapras**!

Heal at Nana's house again, then pick up a hidden *Heart Scale* and enter the cave to the right.

Use the fire move in battle, then surf across. Exit the southeast ladder to get:

ZCell 029: Evergreen Island

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image29.png"/>

Enter again and take the ladder down. We can't yet do the strength puzzle portion, but we can explore. Beat the trainers then grab the *X Special*. Hidden is a *Zinc, Rare Candy*, and *Full Heal*. Hop into the hole all the way at the bottom. Grab the *DeepSeaScale* then head through the hole. We can't do anything in this area yet, but we will come back. Head back up the ladder twice. Jump down the leftmost hole to get *DeepSeaTooth*. In this path you'll find the Icy Rock. That's all we can do for now without strength, so head back out of the cave.

Finally, enter the forest.

There are also Swablu that fly around here. There is a stationary Stantler to the right in the forest, as well as **Buneary**. Catch two for a trade!

There are lots of *Snowballs* on the ground we can pick up. Hidden around the entrance areas are a *Max Repel*, and *Genius Wing*. Head up and to the right for a *Dusk Ball* on the mountain.

Head back to the middle area. Hidden as you head up and to the dead end on the left is *Ice Heal, Ice Gem*, *Paralyze Heal, Hyper Potion, Zinc*, and *Genius Wing*. Surf across the pond we passed earlier. Hidden on this path is *Resist Wing, HP Up, Rare Candy*, and *Magical Seed*. At night we can battle stationary Snorunt.

Head back down and surf back across the pond. Go up and right to find a hidden *X Special*. Finally go all the way up to the spring and grab the *Max Repel*. Whether you got Anju's Pendant or not, the Mysterious Emblem will allow you to enter the spring of preservation at the top.

Enter the spring and talk to the **Piplup** for a battle.

One more thing we can do in this area for now: evolve one of your Buneary via happiness into **Lopunny*,* then trade it with the person on Evergreen Island for a **Shroomish**.

That's all we can do in the Route 11 area.

Take the boat to Terajuma, then surf up in this spot to return to where we got Valarie's badge, and get Poliwag \#4. Head up to Valor Shore and surf up for Poliwag \#5.

Head up and talk to Dragonite! He's lost all his letters again. The first is on the island immediately to the right. The second is on an island around a loop dead south of Dragonite. The third is dead east of the second. Finally, the fourth is on Route 5 in the grass on the left. Talk to Dragonite again to get a *Shiny Stone*.

Return to the Terajuma Jungle, and find the girl who wants the berries. Give them to her and you'll be able to buy some mulch.

Terajuma Jungle Mulch Shop

|Item          |Price|
|--------------|-----|
|*Growth Mulch*|$200 |
|*Stable Mulch*|$200 |

That's all we can do for this massive load of quests, so head back to Crawli's gym.

|-----------|---------------|
|Giga Drain |3 Green Shards |

Talk to Aelita at the top, then head in. Flying around in here are wild **Yanma*,* which you can catch. It can be useful for this fight if you want to go train it up due to its strong AncientPower and Air Slash. Anyways, pass Crawli and head into the cave at the top. Head left and then follow this path down to get:

ZCell 031: Kakori Depths

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image31.png"/>

Anyways, if you head outside the gym, there's an Audino breeder by the Pokemon Center. You'll get 5 *Exp. Candy M* each time you win. Once you're ready, return to Crawli's chamber and stand across him!

Barbed Web: Bug \| Physical \| 75 power \| 100% accuracy \| Hits both foes in a Double Battle \| Increased critical hit ratio. If the target's side of the field already has Sticky Web, sets a layer of Spikes.

Ho boy, this is a tough battle if you're not prepared. Crawli's team plays in doubles and basically has everything stacked for it - a field that boosts almost all his Bug moves and gives Slash a grass typing, rain that nullifies fire types entirely, and a well-structured team built around speed control. Ariados will be +1 attack and immune to damage for its first turn, but you can do the same with a Telluric Seed. After Galvantula dies, he doesn't really have anything that is inherently speedy - so if you can find a way to get rid of or ignore the sticky web, you'll be able to wear him down. Rock Slide is great here -
everything bar Escavalier will go down to it handily.

You can also take advantage of the rain! Swift Swim will help you negate the speed loss from the Sticky Web, plus rain boosted water moves. Alternatively you can duke it out on Rainbow Field by changing the weather to sunny.

Once you've triumphed, claim the Infested Badge for Pokemon up to level 50.

Head outside and talk to Melia and Valarie.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I sure did. (Melia +2)
- It was a tough battle... (Neutral)
- I lost. (Melia +4)

That's it for this part!
