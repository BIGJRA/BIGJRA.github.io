# Chapter 5: Imprisoned

## 4 Badge Quests

Head back out of the ruins. A couple rewards and quests to do in Goldenleaf.

And head back out. Now that the people of Goldenleaf have decided to change their ways, they'll give us some stuff if we talk to them around town: a *Super Potion*, a *Revive*, a *Full Heal*, and *3 Dusk Balls*. A man in one houe will also give us **Snubbull**!

Cut the tree next to the gym and enter Wispy Ruins behind the waterfall. Step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 4: a *Big Nugget*! 

Finally, go to the graveyard at the west of town at night with a GourmetTreat, and you'll find a **Misdreavus**!

## Wispy Ruins

Now, head back into Wispy Ruins at the statue. Go right at the fork.

**Wisp 07: Wispy Tower**

!img("wisp07.png")

Now go up, and a couple of Shuppet will drop you into a pit.

!enc(12)

Our goal here is to trap all the Shuppet into corners. There's one in the southwest - after it moves for the first time: D L D U R R. 

Now go up to the west middle area where you'll see another. Once it moves for the first time: D L D R R R U. Also, grab this *Max Repel* while you're here.

Head down from here, hidden is a *Yellow Shard*. You'll see a **Phantump** wandering around. It is vital for an event later that you get a female one here, so reset if it's not. Head all the way north afterwards, and past another Phantump, step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 2: a *Dawn Stone*!

Loop back around to the lower middle, where the trainers are.

!battle(["Moira",:CRUSHGIRL,0], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Rudey",:ROCKER,0], "Haunted Field")

Head up and to the right and grab the *Cleanse Ta*g, then follow Shuppet down and up into the middle. Get it to go back through the big loop counterclockwise, then follow it. It should now be on the upper path, so follow it right and get it to crawl into the small path in the middle.

Go up through the center and head left to grab the *Calcium*. Head up and left to chase the last Shuppet. For this one, get it to the platform in the upper left, then to the platform to the right, and down. Return to the middle of the north side and the Shuppet will let you pass. 

Before climbing the ladder, step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 1: a *Dusk Stone*! Head back to the ladder and go up.

**ZCell 028: Wispy Ruins**

!img("zcell028.png")

Head to the right. There isn't anything to do in the rightmost room for now. Go down to return to the entrance of Wispy Ruins - I recommend healing. Once you're done, return to the room with four exits, then go up and follow the path.

!battle(["Jeremie",:HIKER,0], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Vitali",:GUITARIST,0], "Haunted Field")

Hop your way past all the rocks on the right, then you'll enter a double battle against some Wild Pokemon. 

!dbattle(["Banette",:POKEGANG3,0], ["Scrafty",:POKEGANG4,0], "Haunted Field")

This is an easy fight if you have strong and fast Pokemon.

Proceed to Route 4!

## Route 4

Welcome to Route 4, a sprawling nature preserve. All over there are items scattered about, and they refresh once a day. Different items will be present each day.

!enc(115, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 4 (South)")

Climb the stairs to the hill here. At night only:

**ZCell 029: Route 4 (South)**

!img("zcell029.png")

Pick up *TM100 Confide* at the top. To the left, climb the stairs to reach a new part of Route 4. There is a hidden *Leaf Stone* here.

!enc(129, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 4 (Central)")

There are also Kricketot and Misdreavus here at different times of day.

Talk to Aelita and Nim at the bridge to the south. 

**ZCell 030: Route 4 (South)**

!img("zcell030.png")

Cross the bridge to the north to Route 4 (Central), and Nim will join your party.

!partner(["Nim",:APPRENTICE,1])

You'll also notice that there are Pidove, Hoothoot, Cubone, as well as **Flabebe** and **Emolga** in this area!

!battle(["Tana",:LASS,0], "Grassy Terrain")

Talk to Beth on the left to get a *Moomoo Milk*. Cross the bridge to the right.

!enc(130, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 4 (East)")

!battle(["Sheila",:OPT,0], "Grassy Terrain")

Interact with the stone den. You'll get *5 Rift Fragments*. These dens have a one-in-seven chance to have a Rare Spawn appear, which will be a light blue color, otherwise it will be purple. These will allow us to catch Shadow Pokemon from within the dens, once we break all of their shields! Not fighting it or defeating it gives 250/500 for common/rare dens respectively, while catching gives 500/1000 respectively.

!raid(1, 4)

Head back to the left and let Cairo break the rock. You'll get another *Moomoo Milk*. Head up.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You okay, Nim? (Aelita +1)
- You're acting weird... (Neutral)

!enc(167, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 4 (Northwest)")

!battle(["Max",:ROCKER,0], "Grassy Terrain")

Cross the bridge to the right.

!enc(166, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 4 (Northeast)")

!raid(2, 4)

!battle(["Sissy",:LADY,0], "Grassy Terrain")

To the right of here, at night, you'll find roaming **Wooloo**. To the right under the bridge, you'll find that *TM45 Attract* is at the bottom.

Enter Cairo's house.

!shop("Cairo's Shop", [["Joy Scent", 5000], ["Excite Scent", 8500], ["Vivid Scent", 11000], ["Bike Voucher", "250 Red Essences"], ["Noctowl Crest", "2000 Red Essences"], ["Simisage Crest", "2000 Red Essences"], ["Simisear Crest", "2000 Red Essences"], ["Simipour Crest", "2000 Red Essences"], ["5 Rift Fragments", 4956], ["15 Rift Fragments", 14868], ["25 Rift Fragments", 24780]])

Crests are unique held items that give the species in question unique strengths to make them better. As you can tell from the four on display, they're generally given to Pokemon that are... otherwise pretty bad. The Noctowl Crest greatly enhances Noctowl's defensive capabilities, while the other three Crests allow the Monkeys far greater offensive coverage and a few added resistances.

Get the Bike Voucher for now if you want, but otherwise start saving up Rift Essence. If you accumulate at least 10000, talk to **Chespin** and Cairo will let you have it! You can check with the Gather Cube the exact amount you have.

Head up. There are Duskull roaming here at night. Try to head into Akuwa Town to the north for a battle with Nim.

!battle(["Nim",:APPRENTICE,1], "Psychic Terrain")

Our second encounter with Nim sees her Pokemon with much stronger Pokemon with stronger Psychic attacks, but they're still no match for a decent team. Good dark types and Pokemon that resist Psychic and/or Rock will do well here. Most of her Pokemon are slow and she doesn't have any speed control, so if you can outspeed and cripple one or both of her Pokemon per turn you'll likely find a way through this one.

## Lost Souls Quest 1

Before proceeding, there are a few sidequests we can take care of. First of all - head into Akuwa Town with Aelita, and talk to the old man. We'll explore Akuwa Town itself later. We can now use the Truck Guy up and right of here to fast travel to Gearen, Goldenwood, and Sheridan, though!

Head to the left at the top of Route 4, and sneak through the gap in the fence. Enter Lost Camp and talk to Maman. She'll quest us with finding *Lost Souls*. Use the truck guy to zip around and find:

1.  Andrew can be found in Abandoned Sewers underneath Gearen City by
    crossing the first bridge north, then the first bridge west, then
    the first bridge down in an alcove at the bottom.
2.  James can be found by entering Spring of Purification from Sheridan
    Village. He's on the right.
3.  Marissa can be found on Wispy Path in the upper right corner of
    where Espurr played with you.
4.  Matthew can be found on Route 3, the second bridge from the bottom.
5.  Cybur can be found on Route 3, next to the mystery egg vendor.
6.  Jessibelle can be found to the right of the Akuwa Town aquarium.

These are the only six we can get before we get a few more HMs. Return to the Lost Camp, where Maman will let us donate to the camp. Donate $5000.

A few orphans will sell you stuff in camp!

!shop("Lost Camp: Andrew", ["Pomeg Berry", "Kelpsy Berry", "Qualot Berry", "Grepa Berry", "Hondew Berry", "Tamato Berry"])

!shop("Lost Camp: Matthew", ["Water Stone", "Fire Stone", "Leaf Stone"])

As an aside, if you want quick AP, we can use Matthew's stones to fill out a lot of categories! Fill up a team with Pickup mons (pickup points), then catch lots of Pansage/Pansear/Panpour (catching points). Alternatively, breed them (egg hatching points and walking around points). Catch any shinies you find as well (catch shiny points). Then, using money you've gotten from selling Pickup items (selling points), buy stones from Matthew (buying points) and use them to evolve each of your monkeys. (evolution points and evolve-by-stone points).

Anyways, Maman will let us donate once more to the camp. Donate $7000, and you'll be able to catch **Eevee**!

## Artist Quest 2 & Mystery Egg Quest

There are a few more quests we can take care of before proceeding.

First, head over to Gearen. I recommend at this point buying the Golden Surfboard and, if you have the AP, the Golden Claws. We won't be able to come back here for a little while after getting Surf, so get the surfboard now.

Make your way down to Oceana Pier. Here, you can buy a single *Link Heart* for $10000. Worth doing if you are using Pokemon that normally evolve by trading in your team.

Level up Slugma to Level 38 to get **Magcargo**. Add it and Emolga to your party, then head back to Route 2's trailer to get *Charcoal* and *Magnet*, as well as *TM96 Nature Power*!

There's one more quest we can do. Go to Sheridan Village. We're gonna take the female Phantump we caught and breed it at the day care to get an Egg. Of what we have, male Cacnea, Oddish, Bellsprout, Sunkern, Cherubi, Slugma, and Shuppet are all good choices for partners if you have them. 

During the daytime, return to the Route 3 market, and talk to the boy in front of the old man. He'll offer you a trade of his Mystery Egg for your Phantump egg.

The mystery egg is unfortunately determined as you start your save file, so it cannot be re-determined by save resetting. Anyways, the mystery egg will be one of these Pokemon: **Azurill**, **Aron**, **Absol**, **Togepi**, **Sneasel**, **Dhelmise**, **Aevian Litwick**, **Axew**, **Mienfoo**, **Pawniard**, **Trapinch**, **Hippopotas**, **Cottonee**, **Darumaka**, **Hatenna**, **Starly**, **Tyrunt**, **Larvesta**, **Mareanie**, **Stufful**, **Rookidee**. These will all be available at some point later in the game, so don't fret if you don't get your favorite right now.

Take the truck back to Akuwa Town.

## Akuwa Town

Now we can explore Akuwa Town a bit. Itemfinder at the entrance to the town will get you a *Super Repel*. There's an egg in the bottom right corner of town. Once it hatches, you'll get **Ducklett**! There's also wild Pokemon in the grass.

!enc(13, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

To the left of the gym is a *Modest Mint*. Enter the house to the north of the truck guy:

**ZCell 031: Akuwa Town**

!img("zcell031.png")

Outside on the beach, you can battle and catch **Clauncher**! You'll also find *TM135 Brine*. Hidden on the beach is a *Soda Pop*.

Head up and up the ladder you'll see here and grab:

**ZCell 032: Akuwa Town**

!img("zcell032.png")

By the truck guy, only at night:

**ZCell 033: Akuwa Town**

!img("zcell033.png")

Near the Ducklett egg location, only at night:

**ZCell 034: Akuwa Town**

!img("zcell034.png")

At this point we will not be able to come back for a bit, so make sure you're ready with all the Pokemon you want to catch on this island for now, and every quest you wanted to finish.

Head into the Pokemon Center to grab the defibrillator, then talk to Aelita. Find her again by the ACDMC on the beach, then go into the gym. Make your way to the back room.

You don't need to win this one for the record...

!battle(["Sonia",:XENDEATHWING_F,1])

## Blacksteeple Castle

### Day 1

Go to sleep.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- How did you? (Neutral)
- You know, the usual. (Saki +1)

Go up the stairs left, then make your way outside and to the east to the quarry. Head down into the mines and talk to Saki.

Accept the fast travel, then go into the battle arena room above. Back in the mine, talk to everyone. Once you do, the bottom area will open.

!battle(["Cici",:OPT,0])

Beat the trainer, then head to the sigil at the top of the mine.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Where's Aelita? (Neutral)
- Are we done here? (Aelita -1)

Exit Neved's office, head back down the stairs, and enter the colorful door. Talk to the crew, then exit the room. If you go into the battle room and exit to the right, you can access some grass with wild Pokemon.

!enc(435)

I recommend catching everything here, in particular Cramorant, who we can't get later on.

Head back to your bed on the lower level and get some sleep.

### Day 2

Head upstairs and talk to the crew. Enter the door in the southwest corner, talk to the left guard to access the shop.

!shop("Blacksteeple Castle", [["Poke Ball", 200], ["Great Ball", 600], ["Ultra Ball", 1200], ["Super Potion", 700], ["Gourmet Treat", 1500], ["Repel", 350], ["Super Repel", 500], ["Escape Rope", 550]])

Talk to the right guard, then head into the courtyard. On the upper level, you'll find a schoolboy.

!battle(["Billy",:CAMPER,0])

Beat him to get the *Mining Kit*.

Enter the quarry again and talk to Adam.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I won it. (Neutral)
- I stole it. (Adam -1)

All those glowing rocks around can be [mined for items](#mining-item-probabilities), just like in 4th gen. If you save in front of a rock and press F12, you can reset the items within.

Break all the rocks, talk to Adam, and use the *Blast Powder* he gives you. Head left and talk to him again.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Calm down. (Adam +1)
- You're useless! (Adam -2)

!battle(["Jona",:BEAUTY,0])

After all that, head into the battle room.

### Night 2

Now you'll control Emma for a bit.

!newself(["Emma",:HOOD,1])

Make your way through the path and all the way to the right. After the first minecart goes, head left and up the hill to talk to a robot for a battle.

!battle(["Purple Stripe",:SECURITYBOT,100], "Cave Field")

Push it into its spot, then repeat with the robot to the left. 

!battle(["Gold Stripe",:SECURITYBOT,100], "Cave Field")

Finally fly over the pit at the bottom and fight the third robot, then push it into its place.

!battle(["Purple Stripe",:SECURITYBOT,100], "Cave Field")

Head into this room, then interact with the computer. Enter the room on the left.

### Day 3

Head out and watch all the scenes. When you regain control, it's time for 3v3 battles in the battle room. 

!battle(["Smith",:TECH,0])

!battle(["Mannie",:TOURIST,0])

!battle(["Emma",:HOOD,0])

Next, enter the library on top of the stairs, and read the purple bookshelf. Next, head to the garden area to the left of the courtyard. Go up at the tree at the top, to reach a secret area.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It was barely a riddle. (Neutral)
- I was stumped. (Saki +1)

!enc(437)

Enter the hut to talk to the crew.

Back in the garden, walk up the stairs on the right to interact with the crew by the sigil. Finally, go right to reenter the castle, go upstairs, and talk to Valarie at the dining hall.

### Night 3

In the prestige room, talk to the candelabra then the bookshelf.

Next, you'll play as Emma again. Head to the battleship first. Sneak your way through the courtyard and then the castle to reach the third floor. Enter Neved's room, then the room to the right.

Back outside, enter the library and talk to the wide blue bookshelf on the left. Then talk to the bookshelf in the middle, then beat the trainer.

!battle(["Cici",:OPT,1])

### Day 4

There's an 'impossible' battle coming up as soon as we do the next cutscene.

Enter the secret garden area again and enter the hut. 

### Day 6 

After a lot of scenes, head back to the secret garden and down the stairs. Push through the false wall, then again on the right.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We're getting out. (PianoLady +2)
- I'm here to help. (PianoLady +1)
- We're screwed. (PianoLady -1)

Grab the *Focus Sash*, then go right and up.

!battle(["Madelis",:XENEXECUTIVE_2,1], "Cave Field")

Be wary of Cinccino, as its 5-hit rock blast is boosted by the cave and tail slap hits hard. Her Houndoom and Salazzle can hit hard but if you can shut them down with a strong Rock or Water type, you'll be ok.

Outside, Nancy will join up with you! Make your way to the courtyard, then up to Neved's office.

!partner(["Nancy",:SUPERSTAR,1])

!battle(["Herald",:PRISONGUARD,0])

!battle(["Simon",:PRISONGUARD,0])

!battle(["Shin",:PRISONGUARD,0])

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay? (Aelita +3)
- I looked for you... (Aelita +2)
- We gotta get to the top! (Aelita +1)
- No time to catch up! (Aelita -1)

Follow the stairs all the way up and prepare for battle. Aelita will join your party for this one.

!partner(["Aelita",:STUDENT,10])

!battle(["Neved",:XENEXECUTIVE_4,0])

Neved has a team that's entirely above your level cap, but you also get to effectively 12 on 6 him with Aelita on your side, so it's not too tough of a fight. Manectric is insanely fast and likes to one-shot Aelita's Pokemon, so take it out quickly if you can. Crippling Crabominable with a burn or attack lower might be a good strategy while you clean up the left side. Watch out for Barbaracle too which hits surprisingly hard. Anyways, just keep up the pressure and make sure the fastest mons is out, then you and Aelita should be able to win.

Well....

!battle(["Madame X",:XENDICTATOR,0])

!move("DECIMATION")

Winning this one is not required. This is of course an extremely difficult battle, in no small part because Decimation is a priority move. Yet the game was careful to give us a single lifeline in the form of a Focus Sash - will you use it to buy yourself time to Poison or Burn Yveltal? Will you take advantage of the fact it likes to use and miss the inaccurate Focus Blast and Hurricane moves? It cannot heal, so any damage is progress! If you want to win this one it is absolutely possible. Winning grants: (+1 Karma).

Whether you win or lose, watch the next scenes play out.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You came to save me? (Neutral)
- Thank you... (Neutral)
- I could've done it myself. (Aelita -1)

Goodbye Blacksteeple Castle!

## Xen Battleship

We'll wake up on the ship with Adam.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- ... (Neutral)
- Don't feel guilty. (Adam +1)
- Maybe so. (Adam +2)

Grab the Poke Ball at the table to get **Mawile**.

There's an Audino breeder in here, and each time you win you'll be given 5 *Exp. Candy M*.

!battle(["Dibby",:POKEBREEDER_M,0], "Factory Field")

Exit the room, and exit the interior at the bottom. Go right.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It's okay. (Melia +2)
- I don't know... (Melia -1)
- ... (Melia -1)

Your *Snag Machine* will finally be fixed! Reenter the interior and head down the stairs to the right to grab the *Dull Key*.

There's also the Akuwa town merchant here:

!shop("Xen Battleship Shop", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Potion", "Super Potion", "Antidote", "Ice Heal", "GourmetTreat", "Super Repel", "Reverse Candy"])

Head up the stairs, and then up the stairs at the top. Follow Melia to the battle room for a fight.

!battle(["Melia",:ENIGMA,0], "Factory Field")

!move("GILDEDARROW")

Gilded Arrow uses the user's second type, unless its Dragon or Fairy, or unless the user has one type, in which cases the first type is used. Confusing! Melia has added three more Pokemon since last time, but her team is nothing too much for us, especially after Madelis and Neved.

After you win, head out to the deck and talk to Melia again.

## Terajuma Jungle

Once you beach, you'll have to battle two rangers, with the above Melia as a partner.

!dbattle(["Alex",:POKEMONRANGER_F1,0], ["Sam",:POKEMONRANGER_M1,0])

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Win this double battle (+3 Melia)
- Lose this double battle (-3 Melia)

!enc(207, ["Fishing"], ["Old"])

Head back on the ship through the loading bay. Head up the two ladders to reach *TM136 Assurance*. 

Back outside in the Shipyard, go up into the jungle.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Everything okay? (+1 Melia, +1 Aelita)
- Huh? (Neutral)
- Where do we go? (Neutral)
- I can handle myself. (-1 Melia, -2 Aelita)

!enc(210, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

It's worth noting the game, for story reasons, has currently frozen the time of day to nighttime, so we can only get those encounters for now here and throughout Terajuma. Don't worry though, the time will change soon.

Grab the hidden *Tiny Mushroom*, *Yellow Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, and *Ultra Ball* on this map. In the top left is *TM131 Bullet Seed* and a hidden *Potion*.

Go up in the top right.

## Kakori Village

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're our friend. (Nim +6)
- About that house... (Neutral)
- She's right, we don't. (-4 Nim, -4 Adam, -4 Aelita, -7 Melia, -4 Valarie, -4 Braixen)

!enc(298, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

Go right, and grab the *4 Yache Berries*. Talk to the Noctowl Statue to activate it. Down from here, you can find a hidden *Hyper Potion* and:

**ZCell 035: Kakori Village**

!img("zcell035.png")

Go left to get a hidden *X Attack*, and *Telluric Seed*. Heading up you can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Swift Wing*, and *Super Repel*.

Enter the house at the bottom right side of the village, then follow her to the Terajuma Shipyard. Enter the Xen Battleship docked inside to the left and talk to her a few times in and around the ship. Talk to her back in Kakori to get a *Destiny Knot*!

Enter the building just northwest of the central stage to begin *The Kakori Monster* quest. Outside, you'll be able to catch a **Salazzle**! Return to the requestor to get a *Fire Stone* and *10 Dusk Balls*.

Enter the Ranger HQ at the top.

!shop("Ranger HQ", ["Poke Ball", "Great Ball", "Nest Ball", "Net Ball", "Escape Rope", "Spice Powder", "GourmetTreat", "Super Repel", "Reverse Candy"])

Buy some Spice Powder while we're here. At the top, trade in your Up-Grade if you still have it with a ranger to get *Scope Lens*! Enter the hallway to the left and grab, well, another *Up-Grade* as well as *3 Max Repels*.

Exit to the Mynori Sea area to the north.

## Mynori Sea

!enc(299, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

!battle(["Aiden",:POKEMONRANGER_M,0], "Beach Field")

!battle(["Shantae",:POKEMONRANGER_F,0], "Beach Field")

On the dock, you can interact with **Tentacool** for a battle. To the right is a *Berry Juice*. To the left, you'll find a replica of Mr. Luck's Tent if you want to grab any tutor moves or track Black Prisms. Up from here on the beach is a *Red Shard*. 

Talk to Novae up from here to begin *Battle Me Again!* 

!battle(["Novae",:WANDERER,2], "Beach Field")

This is a very tough fight thanks to a full team of 31 IV Pokemon prepared to lay you out. Plus, Palossand gets boosted by the Beach Field and can become nigh-unkillable if you accidentally use too many Water moves on it. Lycanroc is particularly threatening offensively, and Tsareena can get in the way of sweeping with priority moves. A lot going on here, but exploiting the Beach Field may be beneficial. 

This is actually a Kakori Help Quest, though we can't get the rewards for finishing it quite yet.

## Deep Terajuma Jungle

A bit of optional exploration next. Enter the Deep Terajuma Jungle in the bottom left corner of the first Jungle map. The encounters here are the same as in the Terajuma Jungle map we just came from, though when it is raining you can catch stationary **Lotad**!

Grab the *Maranga Berry* and *2 Wiki Berries* above, and a hidden *Star Piece*. Cross the bridge below, grab the hidden *Chestnut* and *Bug Gem*.

Enter this building here to begin the *Building Bridges* quest.

Go outside, then head left. You can use the Spice Powder to battle and catch **Vileplume** here!

!battle(["Ceil",:POKEMONRANGER_F,0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Diandra",:POKEMONRANGER_F,0], "Forest Field")

Grab another *5 Chestnuts* hidden around. Pick up the *Quick Powder*, *Full Heal*, and *3 Passho Berries*. 

At the top of the hill, talk to Gurdurr and choose dialogue options to progress. Head up when you are prepared.

!boss("BOSSCONKELDURR", "Forest Field")

A tough boss that hits hard. Thankfully, it doesn't have any way to counter stat drops or status effects, so getting those out there first then wailing on it with super effective moves is the way to go. Once you defeat it, talk to Gerald in his building once more to finish *Building Bridges*. This is also actually a Kakori Help Quest so we can't get the rewards for finishing it quite yet.

Enter the next map.

!enc(268, ["Grass"])

On this map, grab the hidden *Dusk Ball* and *Lemonade*. Go right from here.

!enc(183)

Grab the hidden *Star Piece*, *Red Shard*, *Stardust*, and an *Exp. Candy L* by pushing a floating stone out of the way.

## Tyluric Temple

Return to the previous map and go up.

!enc(406)

For finishing *Building Bridges* we can cross the bridge above and attempt to enter the temple to begin *Tantalizing Temple*!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Why are you interested? (+2 Talon)
- What's in it for you? (+1 Talon)
- No thanks. (+2 Flora, -1 Talon)

!enc(179, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"])

Unfortunately we can't do anything else without Surf. This is all we can do in the Deep Jungle for now, so backtrack all the way to Kakori Village.

## Daytime on Terajuma

A boater in Kakori will take us back to Floria Island for $3000. This isn't strictly necessary to do right now... but we have 35 Zygarde Cells, so Ayuda will give us another *Cell Imprint* as well as the *Soothe Bell*. Our next milestone is 50 cells.

Take the boat from Oceana Pier back to Kakori for $1500. Back in Kakori Village, tell Melia you want to start in the house near the Noctowl Statue. Enter the Ranger HQ and talk to Melia and Crawli in the Dartrix Izakaya. Assuming you beat Rift Gyarados for Agent C, back in Goldenwood Forest:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Don't know him. (Neutral)
- Agent C...? (+2 Crawli)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Cheers! (+3 Melia, +3 Crawli)
- I'm not doing that. (-3 Melia, -3 Crawli)

Once the meal is over, return to the squad house. Note that once you wake up, it will be daytime, so you can get the daytime encounters all around the island now.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- "Are you really okay?" then "I do". (+1 Nim)
- "Are you really okay?" then "Not really." (Neutral)
- You seem worse. (Neutral)
- Move, please. (-2 Nim)

Outside, head into the Terajuma Jungle below. Talk to the woman to the right, then to Growlithe. Similarly to Espurr, we can do various things with Growlithe to build up trust, until our bond is strong enough. You can even give it a bone!! Playing with it over and over again is probably the fastest way to get its friendship up. Once its high enough, have it follow you then attempt to leave to get **Growlithe**! (+1 Karma).

In the bottom left of this map, exit at the bottom to the Terajuma Beach. Now that it is the day time, we can get some stuff here:

!enc(171, ["Grass", "Fishing", "Rock Smash"], ["Old"])

A woman will tell us to show her a Chansey; we shall later.

## Dewdrop Badge

Head to Mynori Sea. Talk to Valarie on the dock when you're ready for your gym battle! You can bet $5K, $10K, or $20K on the outcome (and of course, you can soft-reset if you lose the bet)!

!battle(["Valarie",:LEADER_VALARIE,0], "Water Surface")

!move("AQUABATICS")

So, this is the first *really hard* gym battle, at least from my experience. Ground moves do nothing (even Mud Bomb/High Horsepower for some reason), so for Qwilfish and Lanturn you have to think of something else. Her Qwilfish, Floatzel, and Seaking all have Swift Swim, so they will normally outspeed you and hit hard. Lanturn and Primarina are a bit slower but if you let them get off Aquabatics (special Dragon Dance) then they can steamroll your team. Watch out for Dewgong, too, whose Hydration ability allows it to heal all the way up to full every turn with Rest.

The biggest boon you have is that Electric moves are boosted on this field, meaning an Electric type sweeper may be able to go on a tear. An alternative is to transform the field: 2 uses of Sludge Wave turns it into Murkwater, which takes away some of her advantages and can help a Poison-type oriented team, though she can turn it back with Lanturn and Dewgong's Whirlpool.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're strong... (Valarie +2)
- It was pretty even. (Neutral)
- Ez. (Valarie -2)

For winning, you get the Dewdrop Badge, bringing our level cap up to Lv. 45!
