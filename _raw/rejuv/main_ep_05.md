# Chapter 5: Imprisoned

## 4 Badge Quests

Head back out of the ruins. A couple rewards and quests to do in Goldenleaf.

And head back out. Now that the people of Goldenleaf have decided to change their ways, they'll give us some stuff if we talk to them around town: a *Super Potion*, a *Revive*, a *Full Heal*, and *3 Dusk Balls*. A man in one houe will also give us **Snubbull**!

Cut the tree next to the gym and enter Wispy Ruins behind the waterfall. Step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 4: a *Big Nugget*! 

Finally, go to the graveyard at the west of town at night with a GourmetTreat, and you'll find a **Misdreavus**!

## Wispy Ruins

Now, head back into Wispy Ruins at the statue. Go right at the fork.

**Wisp 07: Wispy Tower**

!img("wisp07.png")

Now go up, and a couple of Shuppet will drop you into a pit.

!enc(12)

Our goal here is to trap all the Shuppet into corners. There's one in the southwest - after it moves for the first time: D L D U R R. 

Now go up to the west middle area where you'll see another. Once it moves for the first time: D L D R R R U. Also, grab this *Max Repel* while you're here.

Head down from here, hidden is a *Yellow Shard*. You'll see a **Phantump** wandering around. It is vital for an event later that you get a female one here, so reset if it's not. Head all the way north afterwards, and past another Phantump, step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 2: a *Dawn Stone*!

Loop back around to the lower middle, where the trainers are.

!battle(["Moira",:CRUSHGIRL,0], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Rudey",:ROCKER,0], "Haunted Field")

Head up and to the right and grab the *Cleanse Ta*g, then follow Shuppet down and up into the middle. Get it to go back through the big loop counterclockwise, then follow it. It should now be on the upper path, so follow it right and get it to crawl into the small path in the middle.

Go up through the center and head left to grab the *Calcium*. Head up and left to chase the last Shuppet. For this one, get it to the platform in the upper left, then to the platform to the right, and down. Return to the middle of the north side and the Shuppet will let you pass. 

Before climbing the ladder, step on the tile, then head in to and get Griselda's Treasure 1: a *Dusk Stone*! Head back to the ladder and go up.

**ZCell 028: Wispy Ruins**

!img("zcell028.png")

Head to the right. There isn't anything to do in the rightmost room for now. Go down to return to the entrance of Wispy Ruins - I recommend healing. Once you're done, return to the room with four exits, then go up and follow the path.

!battle(["Jeremie",:HIKER,0], "Haunted Field")

!battle(["Vitali",:GUITARIST,0], "Haunted Field")

Hop your way past all the rocks on the right, then you'll enter a double battle against some Wild Pokemon. 

!dbattle(["Banette",:POKEGANG3,0], ["Scrafty",:POKEGANG4,0], "Haunted Field")

This is an easy fight if you have strong and fast Pokemon.

Proceed to Route 4!

## Route 4

Welcome to Route 4, a sprawling nature preserve. All over there are items scattered about, and they refresh once a day. Different items will be present each day.

!enc(115, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 4 (South)")

Climb the stairs to the hill here. At night only:

**ZCell 029: Route 4 (South)**

!img("zcell029.png")

Pick up *TM100 Confide* at the top. To the left, climb the stairs to reach a new part of Route 4. There is a hidden *Leaf Stone* here.

!enc(129, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 4 (Central)")

There are also Kricketot and Misdreavus here at different times of day.

Talk to Aelita and Nim at the bridge to the south. 

**ZCell 030: Route 4 (South)**

!img("zcell030.png")

Cross the bridge to the north to Route 4 (Central), and Nim will join your party.

!partner(["Nim",:APPRENTICE,1])

You'll also notice that there are Pidove, Hoothoot, Cubone, as well as **Flabebe** and **Emolga** in this area!

!battle(["Tana",:LASS,0], "Grassy Terrain")

Cross the bridge to the right.

!enc(130, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old"], "Route 4 (East)")

!trainer(["Sheila",:OPT,0], "Grassy Terrain")

Interact with the stone den. You'll get *5 Rift Fragments*. These dens have a one-in-seven chance to have a Rare Spawn appear, which will be a light blue color, otherwise it will be purple. These will allow us to catch Shadow Pokemon from within the dens, once we break all of their shields! Not fighting it or defeating it gives 250/500 for common/rare dens respectively, while catching gives 500/1000 respectively.

RIFT DEN 1 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this den are Graveler, Nuzleaf, **Solosis**, and **Tropius**. The rare ones are Bonsly, Meowth, and Finneon.

Head back to the left and let Cairo break the rock. You'll get a *Moomoo Milk*. Head up.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You okay, Nim? (Aelita +1)
- You're acting weird... (Neutral)

RIFT DEN 2 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are Tranquill, **Wailmer**, Dunsparce, and **Vullaby**. The rare ones are **Chatot**, Snorunt, and Cacnea.

To the right of here, at night, you'll find roaming **Wooloo**. To the right under the bridge, you'll find that *TM45 Attract* is at the bottom.

Enter Cairo's house. He has a shop set up.

Cairo's Shop (\<8 Badges)

|Item               |Price             |
|-------------------|------------------|
|*Joy Scent (10)*   |$5000             |
|*Excite Scent (10)*|$8500             |
|*Vivid Scent (10)* |$11000            |
|*Bike Voucher*     |250 Red Essences  |
|*Noctowl Crest*    |2000 Red Essences|
|*Phione Crest*     |2000 Red Essences|
|*Fragments (5)*    |$4956             |
|*Fragments (10)*   |$14868            |
|*Fragments (25)*   |$24780            |

Crests are unique held items that give the species in question unique strengths to make them better. As you can tell from the two on display, they're generally given to Pokemon that are otherwise bad. The bottom of this file has details on what every crest does!

Get the Bike Voucher for now if you want, but otherwise start saving up Rift Essence. If you accumulate *exactly* 10000, talk to **Chespin** and Cairo will let you have it! You can check with the Gather Cube the exact amount you have.

Head up. There are Duskull roaming here at night. Try to head into Akuwa Town to the north for a battle with Nim.

Apprentice Nim (Psychic Terrain)
-   Stonjourner, Level 37. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Stealth Rock
    -   Heavy Slam
    -   Body Press
-   Darmanitan, Level 37. @ Kee Berry.

    -   Psychic
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Energy Ball

Our second encounter with Nim sees her Pokemon with much stronger Pokemon with stronger Psychic attacks, but they're still no match for a decent team. Good dark types and Pokemon that resist Psychic and/or Rock will do well here. Most of her Pokemon are slow and she doesn't have any speed control, so if you can outspeed and cripple one or both of her Pokemon per turn you'll likely find a way through this one.

Enter Akuwa Town and go with Aelita to the old man. We will explore Akuwa Town in a bit, but there are some quests we can do! Skip the following section to proceed through the story.

## Lost Camp Part 1, and Floria Side Quests

Head to the left, and sneak through the gap in the fence. Enter Lost Camp and talk to Maman. She'll quest us with finding kids to populate the camp, and if you talk to her again a few times, to upgrade the land. The land upgrades total $2500 for the first wave, so do this if you have the money.

She won't upgrade further until we've found four children - so let's go ahead and start finding them. They're located all over the world map, so we'll be taking a brief tour to get them all. A truck driver in Akuwa Town can take us to the previous towns. Five *lost kids* are reachable for now:

1.  Andrew can be found in Abandoned Sewers underneath Gearen City by
    crossing the first bridge north, then the first bridge west, then
    the first bridge down in an alcove at the bottom.
2.  James can be found by entering Spring of Purification from Sheridan
    Village. He's on the right.
3.  Marissa can be found on Wispy Path in the upper right corner of
    where Espurr played with you.
4.  Matthew can be found on Route 3, the second bridge from the bottom.
5.  Cybur can be found on Route 3, next to the mystery egg vendor.

These are the only five we can get before we get a few more HMs, so return to the Lost Camp and there'll be a few new things we can do.

First, Maman will let us donate again. Donate another $2500, and the camp will be upgraded for a second time! Exit and return.

A few orphans will sell you stuff in camp!

Lost Camp: Andrew Shop

|Item          |Price|
|--------------|-----|
|*Pomeg Berry* |$600 |
|*Kelpsy Berry*|$600 |
|*Qualot Berry*|$600 |
|*Hondew Berry*|$600 |
|*Grepa Berry* |$600 |
|*Tamato Berry*|$600 |

Lost Camp: Matthew Shop

|Item         |Price|
|-------------|-----|
|*Water Stone*|$2100|
|*Fire Stone* |$2100|
|*Leaf Stone* |$2100|

As an aside, if you want quick AP, we can use Matthew's stones to fill out a lot of categories Fill up a team with Pickup mons (pickup points), then catch lots of Pansage/Pansear/Panpour (catching points). Alternatively, breed them (egg hatching points and walking around points). Catch any shinies you find as well (catch shiny points). Then, using money you've gotten from selling Pickup items (selling points), buy stones from Matthew (buying points) and use them to evolve each of your monkeys. (evolution points and evolve-by-stone points).

Return to Gearen City, and exchange the Bike Voucher for a *Bicycle*! Gotta go fast.

I recommend also at this point buying the Golden Surfboard and, if you have the AP, the Golden Claws. We won't be able to come back here for a little while after getting surf, so if you don't want to burden your party, get the surfboard now.

Level up Slugma to Level 38 to get **Magcargo**. Add it and Emolga to your party, then head back to Route 2's trailer to get *Charcoal* and *Magnet*, as well as *TM96 Nature Power*!

## Mystery Egg

There's one more quest we can do. This will get us a very strong Pokemon, but if you're not interested, go ahead and skip to the Route 4 section.

Go back through Wispy Ruins to Goldenleaf Town, then take the truck to get to Sheridan Village. We're gonna take the female Phantump we caught and breed it at the day care. Of what we have, male Cacnea, Oddish, Bellsprout, Sunkern, Cherubi, Slugma, and Shuppet are all good choices for partners if you have them. Once you get a Phantump egg, make sure it doesn't hatch, and walk to Route 3.

This will only work during the daytime, but return to the Route 3 market, and talk to the boy in front of the old man. He'll offer you a trade of the mystery egg he just got for your Phantump egg.

The mystery egg is unfortunately determined as you start your save file, so it cannot be re-determined by save resetting. Anyways, the mystery egg will be one of these Pokemon: **Azurill, Aron, Absol, Togepi, Sneasel, Dhelmise, Aevian Litwick, Axew, Mienfoo, Pawniard, Trapinch, Mudbray, Cottonee, Darumaka, Hatenna, Starly, Tyrunt, Larvesta, Mareanie, Stufful, Rookidee**. These will all be available at some point later in the game (though not necessarily this version), so don't fret if you don't get your favorite right now.

For now, head back to Route 4 through Wispy Path.

## Akuwa Town?

Now we can explore Akuwa Town a bit. Itemfinder at the entrance to the town will get you a *Super Repel*. There's an egg in the bottom right corner of town. Once it hatches, you'll get **Ducklett**! There's also wild Pokemon in the grass.

Akuwa Town

| Grass: Morning | %  | Grass: Day    | %  | Grass: Night   | %    |
|----------------|----|---------------|--- |----------------|------|
| Buizel         | 30 | Girafarig     | 45 | Buizel         | 30   |
| Skitty         | 20 | Buizel        | 30 | Illumise       | 20   |
| Girafarig      | 15 | Blitzle       | 15 | Girafarig      | 15   |
| Blitzle        | 15 | **Audino**    | 5  | Noctowl        | 15   |
| **Delcatty**   | 10 | **Floatzel**  | 4  | Volbeat        | 10   |
| **Audino**     | 5  | **Lickitung** | 1  | **Audino**     | 5    |
| **Floatzel**   | 4  |               |    | **Lickitung**  | 4    |
| **Lickitung**  | 1  |               |    | **Floatzel**   | 1    |

| Old Rod        | %        |
|----------------|----------|
| Buizel         | 70       |
| Seel           | 30       |


Head up to the gym area, but before you go in, directly head east. Behind a tree you'll find Jessibelle, the sixth of nine *lost kids* who you can send to the lost camp. To the left of the gym is a *Modest Mint*.

Enter the house to the north of the trucker:

ZCell 015: Akuwa Town

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image15.png"/>

Talk to Aelita and then enter the Pokemon Center and go to the back to get a *Defibrillator*, then use it on the old guy. Head down to the beach area -- here you'll be able to fight wild **Corsola**. You'll also find *TM135 Brine*. Hidden on the beach is a *Soda Pop*.

Head up and up the ladder you'll see here and grab:

ZCell 016: Akuwa Town (ignore the Ditto!)

<img src="/assets/images/rejuv/image16.png"/>

At this point we will not be able to come back for a bit, so make sure you're ready with all the Pokemon you want to catch on this island for now, and every quest you wanted to finish.

Once you're ready, head into the Aquarium/gym and go into the backroom. You don't need to win this one for the record...

## Blacksteeple Castle

Blacksteeple is one of my favorite sections of this game, but its very story driven and has relatively few battles, items, wild Pokemon and the like. I'll be telegraphing every move you must do during this part of the game, but I also do believe it's more fun to play this part without referencing any guide unless you get stuck. We won't be able to come back later (at least in this version), so it might be a good idea to scan this section after you're done to ensure you don't miss anything. As a note - the outdoor section in the middle will be referred to as the courtyard, the east section will be the quarry, and the left section will be the fields.

### Day 1

We'll wake up in the cells. Go to sleep.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- How did you? (Neutral)
- You know, the usual. (Saki +1)

Exit the only way you can, then make your way outside and to the east to the quarry. Head down into the mines and talk to Saki.

Accept the fast travel, then talk to everyone in the mine. Once you do, the bottom area will open. Beat the trainer, then head to the sigil at the top of the mine.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Where's Aelita? (Neutral)
- Are we done here? (Aelita -1)

Exit Neved's office and head back down the stairs and head all the way up into the colorful door. Talk to the crew, then exit the room. If you go into the battle room and exit to the right, you can access some grass with wild Pokemon.

Blacksteeple Castle

| Grass         | %        |
|---------------|----------|
| **Tangela**   | 45       |
| **Teddiursa** | 25       |
| **Cramorant** | 15       |
| **Abomasnow** | 4        |
| **Ursaring**  | 4        |
| **Delibird**  | 2        |

I recommend catching everything here, in particular Cramorant, who we can't get later on.

Head back to your bed and get some sleep.

### Day 2

Head on out and talk to the crew. Enter the door in the southwest corner, talk to the left guard to access the shop.

Blacksteeple Castle Shop

|Item          |Price|
|--------------|-----|
|*Poke Ball*   |$200 |
|*Great Ball*  |$600 |
|*Ultra Ball*  |$1200|
|*Super Potion*|$700 |
|*GourmetTreat*|$1500|
|*Repel*       |$350 |
|*Super Repel* |$500 |
|*Escape Rope* |$550 |

Talk to the right guard, then head into the courtyard. On the right-side upper level, you'll find a kid, battle him to get the *Mining Kit*.

Enter the quarry again and talk to Adam.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- I won it. (Neutral)
- I stole it. (Adam -1)

All those glowing rocks around can be mined for items, just like in 4th gen. The item probabilities within are as follows:

| *Splash Plate*   | 0.3%          |
| *Pixie Plate*    | 0.3%          |

These items can be nice to pick up, but you'll be able to get them all over the story so don't stress too much right now. Once we can revive fossils, I will mention them all at once, but feel free to mine at your leisure. If you save in front of a rock and press F12, you can reset the items within.

Break all the rocks, talk to Adam, and use the *Blast Powder* he gives you. Head left and talk to him again.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Calm down. (Adam +1)
- You're useless! (Adam -2)

Beat the trainer. After all that, head into the battle room.

### Night 2

Now you'll control Emma for a bit. Make your way through the path and all the way to the right. After the first minecart goes, head left and up the hill to talk to a robot for a battle. Push it into its spot, then repeat with the robot to the left. Finally fly over the pit at the bottom and fight the third robot and push it into its place.

Head into this room, then interact with the computer.

### Day 3

Head out and watch all the scenes. When you regain control, it's time for 3v3 battles in the battle room. The first two are easy, however the last is against Emma.

Hooded Girl Emma (No Field)
-   Zoroark, Level 37.
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Grass Knot
-   Gardevoir, Level 38.
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Psychic
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Calm Mind
-   Meganium, Level 38.
    -   Nature Power
    -   Magical Leaf
    -   Leech Seed
    -   Poison Powder

These three can all be threatening in their own way but choosing the right three will net you the victory easily.

Next, enter the library on top of the stairs, and read the purple bookshelf. Then head to the garden area to the left of the courtyard. Go up at the tree at the top, to reach a secret area.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- It was barely a riddle. (Neutral)
- I was stumped. (Saki +1)

Enter the hut to talk to the crew.

Back in the garden, walk up the stairs on the right to interact with the crew by the sigil. Then reenter the castle and talk to Valarie at the dining hall.

### Night 3

In the prestige room, talk to the candelabra then the bookshelf.

Next, you'll play as Emma again. Head to the battleship first. Then sneak your way through the courtyard and then the castle to reach the third floor. Enter Neved's room, then the room to the right.

Back outside enter the library and talk to the wide blue bookshelf on the left. Then talk to the bookshelf in the middle, then beat the trainer.

### Day 4

There's an impossible battle coming up as soon as we do the next cutscene, so make sure if you want to win add Fletchling with Quick Guard to your party.

Enter the secret garden area again and enter the hut. After a lot of scenes, head back to the secret garden and down the stairs. Push through the false wall, then again on the right.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- We're getting out. (PianoLady +2)
- I'm here to help. (PianoLady +1)
- We're screwed. (PianoLady -1)

Go right and up.

Xen Executive Madelis (Cave Field)
-   Cinccino, Level 36.
    -   Bullet Seed
    -   Rock Blast
    -   Tail Slap
    -   Encore
-   Tsareena, Level 37.
    -   Trop Kick
    -   Bounce
    -   Nature Power
    -   Low Sweep
-   Sharpedo, Level 38. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Bounce
    -   Crunch
    -   Psychic Fangs
    -   Waterfall
-   Florges, Level 37.
    -   Nature Power
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Synthesis
    -   Giga Drain
-   Salazzle, Level 37.
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Foul Play
    -   Toxic
-   Houndoom, Level 39. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Nasty Plot
    -   Sludge Bomb

Be wary of Cinccino, as its 5-hit rock blast is boosted by the cave and tail slap hits hard. Her Houndoom and Salazzle can hit hard but if you can shut them down with a strong Rock or Water type, you'll be ok.

Outside, Nancy will join up with you! Beat the guards as you go. She has a Level 65 Sylveon (!) so you shouldn't have to worry much. Once you get to the courtyard, head back up to Neved's office.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Are you okay? (Aelita +3)
- I looked for you... (Aelita +2)
- We gotta get to the top! (Aelita +1)
- No time to catch up! (Aelita -1

Follow the stairs all the way up and prepare for battle. Aelita will join your party for this one.

    -   Rock Slide

Neved has a team that's entirely above your level cap, but you also get to effectively 12 on 6 him with Aelita on your side, so it's not too tough of a fight. Manectric is insanely fast and likes to one-shot Aelita's Pokemon, so take it out quickly if you can. Crippling Crabominable with a burn or attack lower might be a good strategy while you clean up the left side. Watch out for Barbaracle too which hits surprisingly hard. Anyways, just keep up the pressure and make sure the fastest mons is out, then you and Aelita should be able to win.

Well....

Madame X (No Field)
-   Yveltal, Level 100. @ Soul Stone.
    -   Decimation

This is one of those 'impossible' RPG battles. Ultimately, you're supposed to lose this one obviously, but if you're crafty, the game will acknowledge your victory should you manage to succeed with +1 Karma.

Decimation is a priority move, but it ignores abilities. Hence, we have to use Quick Guard! Decimation has 20 PP and Quick Guard starts with 15. TWO Pokemon with Quick Guard can drain its PP with Quick Guard, then watch it struggle to death!

Whether you win or lose, watch the next scenes play out.

Gilded Arrow: Type is the same as the user's secondary type, unless the user is single-typed or their secondary type is Dragon or Fairy, in which case the type is the user's primary type \| Special \| 80 power \| 100% accuracy \| Increased critical hit rate.

Melia has added three more Pokemon since last time, but her team is nothing too much for us, especially after Madelis and Neved.

After you win, head out to the deck and talk to Melia again.

## Terajuma Shore

Once you beach, you'll have to battle two rangers. Winning grants +3 Melia relationship points, while losing takes away -3 Melia relationship points.

Back on the ship, head up the two ladders to reach *TM136 Assurance*. Head down from the ship, and you'll see a **Pyukumuku** on the shore.

Hidden on this beach is a *Grass Gem*. Talk to Nim at the bottom.

Go to the east. Pick the two *Passho Berries*. Use the itemfinder on this side to find *Soda Pop* and *Fresh Water*.

Some optional content will require us to have 5 total Spice Powder eventually, so buy them here. You'll see a guy here who will offer to boat us back to Gearen City for a price - a way to go free will open up a bit after the upcoming gym fight, so I would recommend waiting unless you need something from Floria Island for the fight.

When you're ready, head into Terajuma Jungle to the north.

There are also Hoppip flying around in the mornings. Via itemfinder, on the right side pick up a *Sitrus Berry*. Towards the left is a *Fire Gem*.

Once you've gotten a feel for the middle area, talk to the group of your friends, specifically Melia, on the left side. We're going to have to take the long way, so head into the left path and into the cave.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- Four, is that enough? (Melia +1)
- What's a badge? (Melia +2)
- Can't I just swim? (Valarie +1)

After a brief conversation there's just one thing left to do for this section!

## Dewdrop Badge

Once you've healed, talk to Valarie outside for her gym battle.

Aquabatics: Water \| Status \| Raises the user's Special Attack and Speed by 1 stage each.

So, this is the first *hard* gym battle, at least from my experience. Ground moves do nothing (even Mud Bomb/High Horsepower for some reason), so for Qwilfish and Lanturn you have to think of something else. Her Qwilfish and Floatzel have Swift Swim, so they will normally outspeed you and hit hard. Lanturn and Primarina are a bit slower but if you let them get off Aquabatics (special Dragon Dance) then they can steamroll your team. Watch out for Dewgong, too, whose Hydration ability allows it to heal all the way up to full every turn with Rest. If you can get past the first two fast attackers though, a strong physical set up sweeper might be able to get through the rest of her team. An alternative is to transform the field: 2 uses of Sludge Wave turns it into Murkwater, which takes away some of her advantages and can help a Poison-type oriented team, though she can turn it back with Lanturn and Dewgong's Whirlpool.

**Relationship Point Choices**:
- You're strong... (Neutral)
- It was pretty even. (Neutral)
