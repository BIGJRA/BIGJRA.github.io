# To Julia

Welcome to my 100% walkthrough. I love this game, I hope you will too, and I hope this walkthrough can help you if you get stuck or if you want to collect everything that you can in the game.

## All Aboard!

The game will first ask you to choose a player character and gender. It will then ask you if you want to view controls. You can actually rebind controls with F1 and even add controller support! Once you've gotten acquainted with your chosen controls, you'll find yourself on the train.

Ame will ask you if you have any special instructions or passwords. From the game's readme:

<div id="quote">
    <p> At the start of the game, you will be prompted for special instructions, or passwords. Below is a list of applicable passwords. Please note that these are features are considered a bonus, and may have some  unexpected interactions at times... 
    </p><br><br>
    <p>Implement a hard EXP cap when maxed on badges, similar to Pokemon Rejuvenation: </p><br>
        <ul><li>Password: hardcap</li></ul><br>
    <p>Cause randomized early game Pokemon events to bias towards a specific type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Password: mononormal</li>
            <li>Password: monofire</li>
            <li>Password: monowater</li>
            <li>Password: monograss</li>
            <li>Password: monoelectric</li>
            <li>Password: monoice</li>
            <li>Password: monofighting</li>
            <li>Password: monopoison</li>
            <li>Password: monoground</li>
            <li>Password: monoflying</li>
            <li>Password: monobug</li>
            <li>Password: monopsychic</li>
            <li>Password: monorock</li>
            <li>Password: monoghost</li>
            <li>Password: monodragon</li>
            <li>Password: monodark</li>
            <li>Password: monosteel</li>
            <li>Password: monofairy</li>
        </ul><br>
    <p>Prevent Pokemon from being healed after their HP drops to 0:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nuzlocke</li></ul><br>
    <p>Randomly reshuffles species and moves as rolled at game start:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: randomizer</li></ul><br>
    <p>Pokemon do not need to know HM (TMX) moves in order to use them in the field:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: easyhms</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Prohibits the player's use of items in trainer battles:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: noitems</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 252 EVs and 31 IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: fullevs</li></ul><br>
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 0 EVs and IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: litemode</li></ul><br>    
    <p>Makes all Field	Notes visible immediately</p>
        <ul><li>Password: allfieldapp</li></ul><br>
    <p>Remove some randomness by making all attacks do consistent damage rather than a roll:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nodamageroll</li></ul><br>
    <p>Multiple passwords, including differing monotypes, may be used in tandem with 
    each other, but progress at your own risk~</p><br><br>
    <p>Other hidden passwords may be able to be found in the game.</p>
</div>

If this is your first time playing, don't worry too much about passwords - in fact you can activate passwords later on into the game if you'd like. 

If you want some of my opinions on these passwords:

- If you want to do a challenge run, try one of the *mono\[type\]* passwords. It doesn't enforce any explicit rules for battle, it simply guarantees you suitable Pokemon for random events. I love to do monotype runs (for example, [here's one I have already completed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonReborn/comments/uh5wnk/i_cleared_the_entirety_of_e19_with_only_water/) ) so I really recommend trying one of these especially for a second playthrough.
- I don't prefer these personally, but you can do *nuzlocke* or *randomizer* if you'd like, just note that Nuzlocke doesn't enforce a first-mon-per-area rule explicitly. You can even do both at the same time.
- *hardcap* lets you avoid disobeying via overlevelling, and *easyhms* allows you to use HM's without teaching them to your Pokemon.  I think it is worthwhile to play the game without these two to get the "classic" reborn experience at least once, but if you know you'd prefer the quality of life that comes with these passwords feel free to use them.
- *noitems* makes it so you can't use in battle items like Potion and X-Attack. I prefer this for the extra difficulty it provides and how it increases the value of moves like Recover.
- *nodamagerolls* makes it so moves will always roll the same damage. There are some fights in this game you practically must reset for a couple times at least, so minimizing the randomness is in my opinion pretty handy.
- *fullevs* ramps up the difficulty significantly by making every Pokemon both hit hard and have some bulk. I only recommend this for players with experience.
- *allfieldapp* lets you see data about fields from the start. If you're following this guide I'll be picking up all the notes naturally anyways, so unless you really want to know right away how each field works you'll be ok skipping this one.
- *litemode* is a good choice if you are struggling or want to experience the wonderful characters, world, and puzzles without as much emphasis on battling prowess.

Regardless, *this guide will be from the perspective of a player who is using no passwords.* 

After you're done inputting passwords, enjoy the rest of your train ride!

## Grand Hall

As soon as you're off the train, you'll have a conversation with Ame and Julia. I won't be explaining story events much at all in this walkthrough. This conversation does quietly show off a mechanic in Pokemon Reborn: relationship points! Certain dialogue triggers and events will make certain characters like you more or less. What do they do? [Ame's Devblog post](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/development/records/about-relationship-points-r83/) explains it pretty well, so you can read that to decide if you want to care about them or not.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Julia)
- No (Neutral)

Immediately down from your starting position, in a rock you'll find a hidden *Normal Gem*. There are tons of hidden items in this game, and we won't get the Itemfinder for another two badges or so. I will try my best to explain the positions of all the hidden items that I can until then.

Heading to the right, you'll see a black and green streetsign. Two tiles to the right is a pile of trash containing a hidden *Poke Ball*. To the right you'll find a manhole cover - on the left side is a hidden *Red Shard*. Shards will actually be pretty useful in Reborn for obtaining Ability Capsules and Pokemon as well as learning moves via move tutors.

Proceed to the right into Opal Ward. A girl at the bottom of the area will give you a *Potion*. In general, talk to as many people in Reborn as you can - they offer helpful tips for battles, give you useful items, etc.

If the weather is sunny you will see an Ice Cream Cart here.

Opal Ward Ice Cream Shop

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$600       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$800       |
|*Blue Moon Ice Cream*\*|$20000     |

Every day the Ice Cream Shop appears, there is a 1 in 21 chance that they will be selling the rare Blue Moon Ice Cream. If you talk to them and they are not, then they will not carry Blue Moon Ice Cream until the next sunny day. However, if you save before speaking to them, you can reset the game until they are carrying Blue Moon Ice Cream. It is too expensive for us right now by far, but should you ever want to buy it keep this trick in mind.

Talk to the girl in front of the big building here, and you'll head in. Welcome to the Grand Hall.

Upstairs, you'll be asked which starter Pokemon you'd like to get. You actually get to choose between 21 starters, or you can let fate decide by using the computer at the top of the room. One amazing thing about Reborn is that you can obtain every single Pokemon in the first seven generations within a single savefile of Reborn without trading, and that includes the starters. So, regardless of which you pick, you'll be able to get the other 20 eventually. Your choices are:
- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**

One amazing feature that Pokemon Reborn has is that it doesn't arbitrarily lock each Pokemon's 'hidden' ability behind weird methods. Every Pokemon has an equal chance of having its Hidden Ability as its normal abilities regardless of how you obtain them. That means you can get Intimidate Litten, Sheer Force Totodile, Contrary Snivy and more right now. It is ultimately up to you what you choose of course. Many players recommend Torchic due to its Speed Boost ability, but each starter can be useful in its own way.

If you save in front of the starters (quicksave is, by default, 'D'), you can reset (resetting is, by default, F12. You will become very familiar with this button.) until you get one with satisfactory nature, ability, IV's, and even shininess. The shiny rate in this game is roughly 1 in 91 in this game, so you might just end up with a shiny starter on your first try!

Talk to Ame as soon as you're done, and you'll be taken downstairs and fight your first battle!

Pretty Boy Cain. Field: No Field
- Nidoran M., Lv. 5, Ability: Hustle, Bashful Nature, IVs: 3
    - Tackle
    - Leer
  
Use your starter's stat lowering move once if you'd like then spam your attacking move and hopefully you can win. Note that winning this one is not required. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Cain in battle (+1 Cain)
- Lose to Cain in battle (Neutral)

Once you are done with that battle, you'll be healed, then thrust into another without changing things up. While this isn't too bad right now, this will happen more in this game. One thing I should note is that if you spam the quicksave key specifically while a character is moving, you can save between battles. 

Apprentice Victoria. Field: No Field
- Litten, Lv. 5, Ability: Blaze, Bashful Nature, IVs: 10
    - Scratch
    - Growl

You'll be Lv. 6 now if you won the last one. Use a similar strategy and hopefully you'll come out on top. Note that again winning this one is not required.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Victoria in battle (+1 Victoria)
- Lose to Victoria in battle (Neutral)

After the battle, Ame will give you the *Pokedex*, the *Pokegear,* and of course the *Running Shoes*! Plus, Victoria will give you 5 *Poke Balls*.

Now, we can explore the Grand Hall. This is the region's hub building - we will be checking back here often. 

Talk to the guy in the top left - he will tell us about the password *litemode*. We already knew about this one from the readme, but you can enter it in the future if you'd like.

A guy behind the desk will allow us to bring in grinding trainers to the grand hall. Right now they're a bit too tough for us, but we can come back a bit before the gym leader to grind later.

Talk to a guy next to some display cases if you'd like to buy some candy.

Grand Hall Common Candy Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy* | $75       |

As you might guess, Common Candies are the opposite of rare candies - they'll decrease your Pokemon's level. If you're not doing hardcap, they can help us keep your Pokemon under the level cap, thus obeying your commands. Note that the current level cap is 20 - until we beat the gym leader, Pokemon won't obey at Lv. 21 and beyond. We shouldn't need any common candies right now though. To his right is another shop:

Standard Shop (0 Badges)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

In this guide I will be catching every single Pokemon as soon as it becomes available, so if you're going to do the same you're gonna need a lot of balls. As in the mainline games, you get a *Premier Ball* with every 10 balls you purchase. In a pinch we can almost always safely return to a Pokemon Center, so buying Potions and Antidotes may be just to save time for now.

On your way out the door, you'll see two people right by the exit. One of them will offer you a Pokemon for $500. But when you do, someone will steal it! If you want to skip this event for now until you have more money you can - we won't actually get to have this Pokemon for... 14 more badges.

That's all we can really do in the Grand Hall for now, so head outside.

## Opal Ward

Note that for now I will not be listing the teams of all of the rando trainers scattered around the region - that would be a lot of content that might not be so useful. If you would like to see the regular trainers, let me know.

Anyways, there is grass here, which means we can obtain new team members! I will be **bolding** any Pokemon that are new.

Opal Ward

|Land (Morning/Day)|%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Rattata**       |30 |**Rattata**       |30 |
|**Bidoof**        |30 |**Meowth**        |20 |
|**Patrat**        |15 |**Ekans**         |20 |
|**Pidgey**        |15 |**Hoothoot**      |17 |
|**Meowth**        |5  |**Spinarak**      |13 |
|**Ekans**         |5  |                  |   |

Specifically I recommend training up Bidoof as soon as possible - it gets Headbutt at Level 13, which allows you to catch Pokemon in trees. We will also be able to trade away Bibarel for a different Pokemon pretty soon, so that's something to keep in mind. There is also an in-game trade for Watchog a little bit down the road, so you may want to consider at least catching a Patrat for now.

On the left side of the area, in the left broken statue you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*.

Talk to the trainer here with the Snubbull or Stufful, and they will leave. Back at the bottom of the area, you'll now be able to fight trainers to get onto Opal Bridge. I will be going from the left side, clockwise around the bridge. 

Head up and to the left, beating the trainers as you go. A rock in the top left corner contains a hidden *Awakening*. To the right, you'll fight a Gentleman. All the way down from him and one tile to the left contains a hidden *Blue Shard*.

To the right, you'll find three bullies. You'll need two Pokemon to be able to fight the last two, so catch a second if you haven't yet. When you win, you'll get **Pachirisu** or **Zigzagoon**, randomly determined. Note that whenever there is a random event like this, you will be able to get the other one(s) later in the game. The *monoelectric* password would guarantee Pachirisu, for example, while *mononormal* would guarantee Zigzagoon. If you got Zigzagoon, you can train that up instead of Bidoof if you'd like for Headbutt which it learns at level 11.

The first rock you see down from here contains a hidden *Antidote*. After defeating the trainers that's pretty much all we can do here, so head back towards the train station.

## Lower Peridot Ward

In the Lower Peridot Ward, things have opened up! Head up as soon as you can. A rock on the left side will contain a hidden *Escape Rope*. Talk to the guy here, and give him $150 total. We can't do anything in the house behind him quite yet, so head up from here. 

You'll find a gym here. We can't go in yet, but if you go up and around to the right, you'll find a *Gift Box*. 

Also, specifically when the weather is thunderstorming, you'll find **Blitzle** here. Since it's Lv. 15 it might be a bit too tough to deal with right now, so you can come back later. Note that this is the first encounter that is only possible with the right weather - if you'd like to avoid having to wait you can use the *weathermod* password at your next opportunity.

To the left, you'll find a couple of black and green street signs. All the way down and one tile to the right of the top-left sign, you'll find a hidden *Paralyze Heal*. 

To the left, you'll find another Pokemon Center. The rock just outside to the left contains a hidden *Elemental Seed*. Hang on to this for now - it will be useful later on. In a house to the left, you can take a quiz to find out what kind of Pokemon you'd be, just for fun. Enneagram? Myers-Briggs? Nah. *This* is the real personality quiz.

Anyways, down and to the right from here you'll find some more trainers. During a clear daytime, you'll find a Teddiursa! It will run off and we'll have to chase it. 

Immediately above this intersection you'll find a pile of trash paper on the left side, between two girders. One tile up and one tile right from that contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

There's nothing else here for now, so head down and left from this area and enter the first house that you can. Inside, you'll find a *Pokesnax*! This item is crucial for getting certain Pokemon. Back outside, go one tile left and all the way down. In the final tile you can stand on is a hidden *Exp. Candy XS*. 

Head back up and to the right, and you'll find another trainer. The building directly above him has a pile of trash paper to its right, which contains a hidden *Blue Shard*. Up from here, in a box you can find a hidden *Common Candy*. Since we are holding the snax, talk to the dumpster next to it to catch **Gulpin**. Inside the house, also thanks to the snax, you'll be able to catch **Whismur**. 

Return to the guy we gave money to - behind him in a house you will find **Minccino** or **Espurr**, randomly determined. With the snax in your bag, it will join you! 

Head to the left of the Pokemon center, and go down. In a house, a guy will give you the *Old Rod*! 

Back outside, we can actually fish in the dirty water.

Lower Peridot Ward

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Grimer**        |100|

You can talk to the group below if you'd like, but you can't do anything here quite yet. To the right, you'll find a building to the left and up of the snax house. Inside, you'll be able to battle a guy. If you win, he'll let you into his pool, where you can find a *Sea Incense*.

Lower Peridot Ward Pool

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Goldeen**       |70 |
|**Finneon**       |30 |

Head out, and back up past the Old Rod house. You'll find the Name Rater's house here. Up from here, the first barrel you see will hide a *Heart Scale*. Straight to the left and down between the two brown buildings you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*. 

If it is still a clear daytime, here you'll be able to talk to Teddiursa again, who will run off to a random location. I will cover all the locations later on, but keep in mind finding it three times from here will allow you to battle and catch it.

Enter the building here and talk to the old man for a battle. If you win, you'll be able to enter his garden. 

Seacrest's Garden

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Ledyba**        |30 |**Caterpie**      |30 |Hoothoot          |30 |
|**Cherubi**       |24 |**Wurmple**       |30 |Spinarak          |24 |
|**Wurmple**       |20 |**Sunkern**       |30 |**Wurmple**       |20 |
|**Caterpie**      |20 |**Cherubi**       |10 |**Caterpie**      |20 |
|**Sunkern**       |6  |                  |   |**Sunkern**       |6  |

There is a trade for Sunkern we can do later on, so I recommend catching one.

Back outside, head to the right. Enter the first building here. You'll find out about an injured Skitty - when we get an Oran Berry we will be back. Head outside and go right.

You'll fight a trainer in a small park. Once you beat her, talk to her again for a *Rose Incense*. Down and to the left from here you'll find a *Paralyze Heal* hidden in a box.

Back up from here, enter the building. Talk to the guy here and give him the Gift Box we found earlier, and you'll obtain a **Delibird**! The building to the right of this one contains an ailing **Kricketot** which you can obtain by talking to the person here. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Accept Kricketot (+1 Shelly)
- Reject Kricketot (-1 Shelly)

Kricketune with its Fury Cutter attack and Technician ability can be incredible in the early game, so consider using it.

Back outside, talk to the yellow haired guy for a battle. When you beat him you can access the Lower Peridot Alley.

Lower Peridot Alley

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Trubbish**      |60 |
|**Stunky**        |22 |
|**Poochyena**     |18 |

Poochyena evolves early and can have the Moxie ability, so it can be fantastic in the early game.

To the right of the blue bin is a hidden *Dark Gem*. After defeating the trainer on the left you'll get a *Super Potion*. During thunderstorms specifically, you'll be able to get **Tynamo**!

Head outside and go to the right under the bridge. When the weather is rainy, you'll find **Pansear** or **Panpour**, randomly determined. The second from the right box on the bottom row contains a *Purple Shard*. Head to the right.

Underground Railnet (Opal Area)

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Noibat**        |74 |
|**Woobat**        |20 |
|Stunky            |6  |

Woobat can be pretty solid if you evolve it early thanks to its Simple ability.

Plus, a rock at the top left contains a hidden *Guard Spec.* Once you're done here, head back to the left and go up past Seacrest's Garden to enter the northern part of Peridot Ward.

## Peridot Ward

Between two boxes on the left, you can find a hidden *Poke Ball*. In a rock up and to the right from here is a hidden *Oran Berry*. That means we can head back down and enter the first building on the right to get **Skitty**. 

Head back up, then go left. To the left of the factory there is a barrel containing an *Ability Capsule*! Make sure you get it soon because it will eventually become unobtainable.

To the right of here is a trainer with a red hat. Depending on where he challenges you you may need to go around, but between a rock and a barrel above him you'll find a hidden *Burn Heal*. The barrel on the other side of this small building contains a hidden *Red Shard* The in-game trade I mentioned earlier is in this house, but we probably aren't quite ready for it yet, so head up.

Up and to the left of the rock above the street sign you can find a hidden *Blue Shard*, and straight up from here the top of two boxes contains a *Paralyze Heal*. Up from here go left, then in a rock behind a dumpster you can get a hidden *Calcium*. I really recommend selling it for a clean $4900 - if you haven't noticed the trainers in this area don't give you much money.

Defeat the youngsters here and enter this house. A lady will tell you she is afraid of some muggers who aren't here yet, so we can head outside. The fountain out here will actually contain **Surskit** when it is raining. Two tiles down from the left part of the manhole cover here you can find a hidden *Ether*. 

Up from here, when the weather is clear or sunny, as long as you are holding Rose Incense you can catch a falling **Budew**. A rock above contains a *Potion* and one to the left contains a *Red Shard*.

Inside this house you'll find the guy who stole our Pokemon earlier, but you gotta pay another $500! Just kidding, you gotta fight both him and the initial salesman and you won't even get your Pokemon. We'll just have to continue this quest later.

Head down and enter the tall building to your right. Inside two suspicious people will see you and run off. Back in the Igglybuff lady's house you'll have to defeat them. Once you do, you can get **Igglybuff**! Anyways, to the right of the tall building you can defeat another blonde haired guy to get access to another alleyway.

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Trubbish          |45 |
|Poochyena         |34 |
|**Purrloin**      |21 |

In a jar to the left you can find a *Repel*. A box above will contain a *Green Shard*. Our first *Data Chip* is above. You can use it to add a password at any PC, if you'd like.

Outside, enter the small building to the left and pickup the *Potion*. Outside, head straight to the left, and enter the first building. At night, you can catch **Grubbin** or **Joltik**, randomly determined. Note that this will use up one of your snax, so you'll need to buy more to do other snax-related events.

Straight to the left out the door you'll find some trash paper, and to the left of it is a hidden *Common Candy*. Inside the next building is another *Common Candy*. 

The "Standard Shops" in this game operate similarly to main Pokemon game shops in that they update their inventory based on how many badges you have - the Peridot Ward one will have the same inventory as the Grand Hall one until we get a badge, then they will both upgrade. 

Anyways, a small house up from here contains a *Protein*, which again I recommend selling for more ball money. Outside to the right in a box is a hidden *Potion*. A pile of trash paper in the very top left contains a hidden *Clever Wing* (which, again, is good to sell). A guy in the adjacent building will give us a *Common Candy*. Outside there is a shop.

Peridot Ward Snax Shop

|Item       |Price      |

|*Pokesnax* |$650       |

If you use up your Pokesnax and need more, this is the place. Note that he won't be here unless the weather is clear or sunny. 

In the "Jasper" gate here you can find a *Genius Wing* in a rock. Outside you'll find a hidden *Green Shard* a tile to the right of the pair of trash paper tiles. To the right past the trainer a rock contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

Now that we've completed this loop, head back to the bottom left corner of the area. Inside both sides of the dumpster you'll find a *Blue Shard* and *Common Candy*. 

When you're ready, talk to the green haired guy for a battle.

Swag Jockey Fern (Potion). Field: No Field
- Budew, Lv. 13, @Oran Berry, Ability: Poison Point, IVs: 10
    - Mega Drain
    - Natural Gift
    - Stun Spore
    - Covet
- Sandile, Lv. 13, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 10
    - Power Trip
    - Snatch
    - Rage
    - Sand Tomb
- Rowlet, Lv. 14, Ability: Overgrow, IVs: 15
    - Leafage
    - Peck
    - Ominous Wind
    - Confuse Ray

This one is a bit harder than the first two rival fights of course, but nothing you can't handle. Watch out for his Budew, who likes to heal, and his Sandile who can rip through your team of six thanks to Moxie if you're not careful.

Around this time, my Bidoof was able to learn Headbutt, so there are a few Pokemon you can now obtain. First, head to the garden:

Seacrest's Garden

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Swablu**        |55 |
|**Burmy**         |45 |

Note that we will eventually want a Mothim for an in-game trade. Next, head back to Opal Ward.

Opal Ward 

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Pineco**        |40 |
|**Spearow**       |30 |
|**Combee**        |30 |

Now is a good time to finish the Teddiursa quest if you haven't already. Keep in mind this has to be done on a clear day. After talking to it in the bottom part of the Lower Peridot Ward and then again on the left side near the Name Rater's house, you'll need to find it three more times. It can be found in one of the following locations, then will be found in the two after it in the list (cyclically).

1. Nearby the train station, where we started the game.
2. Under the Opal Bridge, nearby Panpour/Pansear. 
3. Above Mosswater Industrial in between two buildings.
4. Next to the Upper Peridot Ward Pokemart.
5. Next to the rock containing the Calcium near the fountain.
6. Nearby the dumpster where we got Gulpin.
7. In the bottom left corner of Seacrest's garden.

**Teddiursa** will then battle you. 

With that out of the way, time to progress the story. Make sure you have your best team for some battles coming up.

You have to two choices: you can head straight to the Mosswater Industrial above Seacrest's Garden, or take a detour first to the Lower Peridot Ward gym. In either case, talk to the character standing in front of the factory when you're ready.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Headed straight to Mosswater Industrial (Fern +1)
- Detoured to Lower Peridot Gym before going to Mosswater (Julia +1)

## Mosswater Industrial

Time for our first dungeon proper! Fern will join us as a partner. Partners are special in this game for a few reasons. Leaving your partner (here, leaving Mosswater Industrial) has a negative effect:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Leave Fern and exit the factory (-1 Fern, just once)
- Stay with Fern and complete the factory (Neutral)

However, talking to your partner while they're walking with you has a positive effect:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Fern while you are together (+1 Fern, just once)
- Ignore Fern in Mosswater (Neutral) 
  
Another cool thing is that partners will heal you after each battle!

Enter the next room and talk with Ace. We'll be wandering around the factory, defeating Team Meteor Grunts and looking for codes. 

To the left across a bridge, you'll see one flashing terminal: XX7X. In the top left you'll find another terminal: X1XX. The three terminals nearby give us some lore that will be relevant later... A terminal to the right shows 3XXX, and the one in the top right corner shows XXX9. Read the other two terminals nearby for more lore, then head down to the elevator and type in our now completed password.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Push the same elevator button as the floor you are on (-1 Fern, only once)
- Don't do that (Neutral)

On the second floor, Rini will start us off with part of the second password: XX6X. Before we proceed, head out the door on the bottom right and follow the path to get an *Exp. Candy S*. Back in the main room, head out to the right, and interact with the terminal here to get the hint XXX2, and the other for lore. Head out to the left, and down at the first opportunity. In this room, use the terminal to discover the hint X8XX. Back outside, go left. In here is another terminal: 4XXX, plus one more with some lore. Back outside again, go up at the bridge, pickup *Paralyze Heal*, type in the code and head in. Beat the grunts and pickup the explosives!

Back in the central room, choose which of the two characters to talk to.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Julia after getting the boomies (+1 Julia, -1 Florinia)
- Talk to Florinia after getting the boomies (-1 Julia, +1 Florinia)

Either way, head in to the room at the top when you're ready for a fight.

Meteor Private Aster and Meteor Private Eclipse. Field: Factory Field
- Rockruff, Lv. 16, Ability: Steadfast, IVs: 31
    - Thunder Fang
    - Howl
    - Bite
    - Rock Throw
- Rockruff, Lv. 16, Ability: Vital Spirit, IVs: 31
    - Fire Fang
    - Howl
    - Bite
    - Rock Throw

Depending on what Pokemon you have this can be a bit difficult since they like to one-shot Fern's Budew, but your sheer numbers can probably overwhelm them regardless.

Outside the factory, Florinia will ask you a question.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Florinia)
- No (Neutral)

You will then be given the Field Notes App in your Pokegear, and offered to turn on a graphical feature that shows off field effect boosts in battle. I recommend doing this! You will also be given the *Electric Terrain Readout*. Anyways, if you noticed, we were battling on the Factory Field earlier. Most of the important trainers in this game we will be fighting on these custom field effects, so the Field Notes will be very helpful.

Before we continue with the story, there are a couple quests we can take care of now. 

Go to the factory area where we first met Fern, and talk to the scientist guy on the right side of the factory. He will give us the *Factory Field Readout*, so now we have more details whenever we have battles on the Factory Field that was in Mosswater.

Head down and talk to the purple haired guy above the train station. A hotshot will steal his painkillers! Follow him inside the North Peridot Alley, where you can fight him. Once you defeat him, return to the guy who will give you 5 *Exp. Candy S*. Nice.

By now hopefully you've been able to evolve your Bidoof into **Bibarel** at Lv. 15. If so, head into the house across from Mosswater to do an in-game trade for **Munna**! If not, now is a good time to grind the repeatable trainers in the upper-right corner of the Grand Hall - remember, they will give you Exp. Candy after each battle and even auto-heal your party! You can also do this as you like to do last preparations for the gym.

## Volt Badge

Enter the Neo-Circuit Power-Plant gym when you're ready. Beat all the trainers in this main room, talk to the Voltorb standing behind them, and blow up the barriers one by one. When you're ready, talk to the gym leader in her room.

Cheer Captain Julia (2x Potion). Field: Electric Terrain.
- Minun, Lv. 12, Ability: Minus, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Charge Beam
    - Encore
    - Quick Attack
- Geodude (Geodude-Alola), Lv. 12, Ability: Galvanize, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Self-Destruct
    - Tackle
    - Charge
    - Rollout
- Voltorb, Lv. 12, Ability: Aftermath, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Explosion
    - Rollout
    - Charge Beam
    - Sonic Boom
- Plusle, Lv. 13, Ability: Lightning Rod, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Charge Beam
    - Encore
    - Quick Attack
- Oricorio (Oricorio-Pom-Pom), Lv. 14, Ability: Dancer, Quirky Nature, IVs: 10
    - Work Up
    - Tailwind
    - Pound
    - Air Cutter
- Electrode, Lv. 15, Ability: Aftermath, Bashful Nature, IVs: 24
    - Charge Beam
    - Sonic Boom
    - Rollout
    - Charge

Pokemon Reborn's first gym leader comes in pretty hot. You'll notice that she mostly uses two strategies across her team: stacking Special Attack with Electric Terrain boosted Charge Beam, and wearing out your Lv. 20 and under Pokemon quickly with Sonic Boom. Her Electrode of course is very fast, and can employ both of these strategies effectively and then take out a chunk of your HP on the way out with Aftermath. Geodude and Voltorb also like to explode, and since the former's is boosted by STAB, Galvanize, and the field... it's gonna hurt. It doesn't help that Oricorio can hit hard and boost the speed of the entire team for a few turns.

Her team luckily isn't super bulky, so trying to get something going with your own sweepers might be the key. Kricketune and Mightyena can really shine here, as well as your second stage starter especially with Torrent / Blaze / Overgrow. The single Elemental Seed we got earlier can grant a Speed boost to the Pokemon holding it, which can be a key component of your strategy. Alternatively, if you got Zigzagoon you can use Mud Sport to destroy the field, making things a bit more even for you.

Once you emerge victorious, you'll be given the *Volt Badge* as well as *TM57 Charge Beam*. TM's are infinite-use, so slap it on anything that can learn it. You also get to go up to Lv. 25 now! Great job completing section 1 of Pokemon Reborn!

# To Florinia

## 1 Badge Quests

Head outside, and talk to Victoria outside the gym. She'll tell us our next destination is to the east of the Grand Hall.

Before we continue though, there are a couple quests we can complete before we proceed to the next area. 

Head nearby the train station in Lower Peridot. While it is raining, if you have a snax in your bag you can give it away to get **Numel**! 

Nearby you'll find a hiker. Talk to him, then talk to the person in the house containing Whismur earlier on. Return to the hiker and follow him to the house to receive **Onix**!

Next, enter the Grand Hall. The Common Candy salesman is now gone but in his place is a person who will give us the *Rainbow Field* readout. You probably can't do much with this one yet, but once you are able to create the Rainbow Field yourself, you do lots of crazy things in battle on it.

Now that we have a badge, Pokemarts will be updated:

Standard Shop (1 Badge)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Repel*        |$400       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

Having a couple repels never hurts, but money is still scarce and catching them all is an expensive task, so I still recommend focusing mostly on balls.

You'll also notice that there are more trainers on Opal Bridge - when you get a new badge, this often happens, so watch out!

## Obsidia Ward

When you're ready, talk to Victoria on the right side of Opal Bridge. New area time!

Head into the Central Salon. Inside, you'll find a friendship checker as well as a groomer who will raise your Pokemon's friendship for $1500. Do this once if you have the money. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Get at least one massage at the Central Salon (+1 Serra)
- Don't get a massage (Neutral)

A lady on the right will ask to see a Pokemon with maximum friendship. Your starter is likely here by now if it's stayed in your party the whole game so far, you've done all the sidequests, and you haven't let it faint too much. If you do show her one, you'll get the *Soothe Bell*! Helpful if you want to accelerate the evolution of your Igglybuff, Woobat, etc.

The building to the right is Critical Capture, where you can buy custom balls.

Critical Capture Shop Right Clerk

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Heavy Ball*   |$300       |
|*Moon Ball*    |$300       |
|*Fast Ball*    |$300       |
|*Love Ball*    |$400       |
|*Nest Ball*    |$500       |
|*Net Ball*     |$500       |
|*Dive Ball*    |$500       |
|*Timer Ball*   |$1000      |
|*Friend Ball*  |$3000      |

Most of these are really not too worth it right now compared to the regular variety (especially Friend Ball... yikes) but I recommend picking up a few Love Balls - their 4x catch rate can be activated 100% of the time given you're trying to catch a non-genderless Pokemon and you have at least 1 male and at least 1 female Pokemon in your party, helpful for Pokemon with lower catch rates we may encounter.

Outside, head right and up. Enter the Pokemon Center, and talk to both the girl on the left and the mother on the right to activate some quests.

Enter the building to the right, and talk to the daycare couple one-by-one over and over until they drop their facade and battle you. Eventually, we will be freeing the real daycare couple! 

In a house to the left, we'll learn about an in-game trade we can't complete just yet. Head outside and to the left, grab a hidden *Steel Gem* in a rock, and go down the stairs to access a new part of the railnet.

Underground Railnet (Obsidia Area)

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Noibat            |60 |
|Woobat            |20 |
|**Klink**         |20 |

Klink is pretty good on the Factory Field which we'll be seeing a lot in this game.

There is also an *Escape Rope* hidden in the left area.

Head back out and enter the Devon Corp building on the main street.

Devon Corp Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*         |$300       |
|*Repel*          |$400       |
|*Poke Ball*      |$200       |

Nothing special here for sale, but if you talk to the mysterious salesman, he'll give you a free *Premier Ball* the first time. 

The next building in line is the Sweet Kiss Candy Shop building. In the top left corner, you can complete a puzzle to get **Swirlix**! The completed puzzle looks like this:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/swirlix.jpg"/>

At the top, a kid really wants some Vanilla Ice Cream. Since he's blocking the machine though we can't get any here - you'll have to wait until it's sunny and buy some from Opal Ward. Give it to this kid and then buy a Vanilla Ice Cream for $1000 from the vending machine - it will be a **Vanillite** in disguise! After this the vending machine will be normal again.

Sweet Kiss Ice Cream Vending Machine Shop

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$700       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$1000      |

There is a 1% chance you will actually get a *Blue Moon Ice Cream* whenever you buy any one of these. Choc and Berry are more expensive here than in Opal Ward, so there's really no reason to buy these here ever.

Sweet Kiss Top Clerk Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Whipped Dream*    |$1000      |
|*Peppermint*       |$600       |
|*Chewing Gum*      |$800       |
|*Pop Rocks*        |$750       |
|*Salt-Water Taffy* |$850       |
|*Red-Hots*         |$850       |
|*Cotton Candy*     |$5000      |

If you're planning on evolving Swirlix, grab a Whipped Dream. Cotton Candy functions as a Revive, but is very expensive. The rest are just expensive versions of the status healing items, but all raise friendship.

Sweet Kiss Bottom Clerk Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy*     |$150       |
|*Exp. Candy XS*    |$500       |
|*Rare Candy*       |$12000     |

I don't think you need to spend your precious money on Exp. Candy since grinding trainers give them every time you beat them.

Back outside, follow Victoria to the right. If you'd like to get to battle Victoria and potentially get a point with her in a bit, talk to Florinia. 

Two tiles south of the nearby statue you'll find a *Pokesnax*, and another *Pokesnax* is hidden down and to the right, above the upper right part of the rightmost building. Head back to the left and go down towards the South Obsidia Ward! The tile above the bottommost dancing vine contains a hidden *Potion*.

Enter the building here and talk to the guy here. His Lillipup will run off - we will have to chase it. As I did with Teddiursa, I will come back to it once we can access all the locations. For now, exit the building. Two tiles to the right, you'll find a hidden *Dire Hit*. 

Head down from here. Between the first two girders is a hidden *Blue Shard*, and past the trainer in the first box you can find a hidden *Green Shard*. 

While it's windy, you can catch wild **Hoppip** here! Anyways, enter the slums.

## Obsidia Slums

Grab a *Potion* in the trash can to the left and head up. A box in the upper right corner contains a *Great Ball*. Heading down and to the left, the open toolchest next to the nerd contains a *Pokesnax*; the pot to the left contains a *Red Shard*.

To the left you'll find a Light Shard, which heals your party but disappears after. You can always leave it here for a little while until you need it more, if you'd like.

If you talked to Victoria near the park earlier, head up and talk to Victoria for a battle. If you didn't or you want to skip her battle, talk to the fridge in the upper right corner to delete the barrier.

Apprentice Victoria (2x Potion). Field: No Field 
- Ralts, Lv. 18, @Wise Glasses, Ability: Synchronize, IVs: 31
    - Magical Leaf

- Torracat, Lv. 19, Ability: Intimidate, IVs: 30
    - Flame Charge
    - Dual Chop
    - Power Trip
    - Bulk Up
Her Torracat likes to try to set up on you, so be careful of that. Otherwise her team isn't anything too crazy - Ralts and Pichu are pretty weak and you can set up on them.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Victoria in the Slums (+1 Victoria)
- Skip talking to Victoria near the park, or use the fridge to skip her fight (Neutral)

After that's done, head down the escalator to the right. There are encounters in this area.

Obsidia Slums B1F

|Cave              |%  |

|**Pidove**        |30 |

|**Pancham**       |10 |
|**Yungoos**       |10 |
|**Crabrawler**    |10 |

There's an *Oran Berry* in this rock, and a *Great Ball* below. You can sneak between the escalators here - pick up a hidden *Max Repel* in a rock and a *Carbos* (read: $4900) in the next room. We can't progress further here, so go back upstairs and go through the door

Obsidia Slums 1F Back

|Yungoos           |10 |
|**Slakoth**       |10 |

A box to the left contains *Pop Rocks*. Defeat the trainer, hop across, defeat another, and pick up the hidden *Rawst Berry* in a rock up here. Head upstairs.

Obsidia Slums 2F

|Cave              |%  |

|Yungoos           |10 |
|Meowth            |10 |

Hop your way to the left, down, pick up a hidden *Potion* in a box here, then go right and pick up the *Moon Stone* here. If you've been dying for Delcatty or Wigglytuff, now's your chance. Anyways, head up the stairs here.

Talk to Corey here, then pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy S* in a jar below. Grab the *Zinc* at the top and head back down.

Make your way to the top right corner of 3F and then head down. In the very bottom right there is a hidden *Ice Heal*.

Head left and emerge onto the roof. There's another Light Shard here - usually they mean either "you're halfway through a dungeon" or "there's a super hard fight coming up". Anyways, follow the path and talk to Mankey in the elevator. Take it to 1F to open a shortcut, then take it to B1F.

Slums B1F Vending Machine Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Fresh Water*  |$200       |

Sometimes you even get two! Anyways, the jar to the left of the elevator contains a hidden 
*Normal Gem* and the toolchest at the bottom by the youngster contains a *Exp. Candy S*. 

If you talk to this guy, he'll battle you - turns out this is the guy who stole our $1000 Pokemon from the thieves in Peridot! But... he sold it to someone else. To be continued!

Before we enter the big door in here, go left and talk to the second box for hidden *Red-Hots*. In the bottom left corner is a hidden *Green Shard*. You can sneak up and to the left past the elevator, if you do, you can get a hidden *Purple Shard* in the topmost rock.

Enter the gap on the left and pick up the *Friend Ball*. Head back out.

Talk to the box in front of the elevator to watch it scurry away. Enter the elevator and go to 1F. Grab the *Net Ball* and talk to the kid here to make him move. In the elevator again go to 2F to grab *TM60 Quash*. Oh yeah.

Enter the big door back on B1F and head up. Once you see this box move twice, head straight to the right to get a hidden *Oran Berry* in a box. In a trash can at the top of this room you can find a hidden *Poke Ball*. In the next room, it's time for a battle!

Pokemon Gang. Field: No Field
- Scraggy, Lv. 15, Ability: Intimidate, IVs: 15

- Scraggy, Lv. 17, Ability: Shed Skin, IVs: 10
- Scrafty, Lv. 20, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 12

As long as you are able to bully Scrafty when it comes out you should be able to make this work with a team of six.

There's a *Potion* in a rock to the left and a *Blue Shard* in the last rock before leaving the room. In the next room, there's a hidden *Potion* in the box on the left and an *Exp. Candy S* in a rock towards the exit. 

Back in the main basement area, go between the escalators to get a *Cotton Candy*. A rock down from here contains a *Burn Heal*. In the room to the right, you can find a hidden *Antidote*, a *Cheri Berry* in the trashcan downstairs as well as a *Super Potion* lying around and an *Exp. Candy S* in the rock below. 

Back upstairs and in the hub, take the escalator to go up. A box on the right contains an *Awakening*. Head to the right and jump your way through this path, pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* and an *Antidote* in rocks on the right side, and go down. Here you'll find an abandoned egg. When it hatches it will be **Bronzor**, **Ducklett**, or **Drowzee**, determined randomly.

Back in the main hub, talk to the backpacker below to get the grate opened for a shortcut, then head back to where Victoria was arguing with the guy earlier and talk to the trashcan to get a *Pokesnax*.

With that, head back to the top right corner and enter the door. Talk to the Spoink hiding under some beams here. Then we can finally emerge into the daylight! There is a hidden ** two spaces right and two spaces down from the bottom-most rock in this area. Enter Coral Ward at the bottom when you are ready.

## Coral Ward

Welcome to Coral Ward. In the right rock as you enter you can get a *Potion*, then an *Ultra Potion* in a rock to the left of the apartments. Heading down from here you can grab a hidden *Purple Shard* one tile down and one tile right of the bottom left warehouse entrance, and a *Chewing Gum* in the box below. There is a *Repel* in the right rock below the singular house. Finally there is an *Aspear Berry* in a rock between the two warehouses on the right.

Inside the apartment complex at the top, you'll meet Danielle who will give you a quiz. Feel free to go find the answers yourself if you'd like. Otherwise, here they are. Whenever you see the following spoiler bar, highlight the text to view the spoiler.

> 4, 7, 31

As a reward for completing the quiz you'll get the *Misty Terrain Readout*. Useful, since Coral Ward is covered in mist.

In a house below, there is an in-game trade. Raise your Patrat to Lv. 20 to get **Watchog**, then trade it for a **Nosepass**.

On the dock, if it is raining and you have Snax, you can obtain **Lotad**.

Talk to the blue haired girl towards the top.

This one isn't too crazy. Notice that Popplio's Icy Wind is boosted by the field, so watch out if you were planning on using anything weak to Ice. Nidorino hits somewhat hard but a Steel type can wall it.

After the battle, you'll be given *TMX1 Cut*!

## Obsidia Park

Return to South Obsidia Ward and use your new TMX to chop down the tree. Thankfully in this game HMs, renamed TMX, can be deleted from your Pokemon at will.

Talk to the kid here - we will reunite him with his mother as soon as we can. Enter the Glazamonia Salon here. If we ever get a Furfrou, we can groom it here. They also offer massages for $2000. A lady here will ask us to investigate the Central Salon for them - we will do so later.

Back in Obsidia Ward, we can actually access one more area before we proceed: at the left end of the ward, chop down the tree and go south. Defeating this trainer gives us access to the Obsidia Alleyway.

Obsidia Alleyway

|Cave              |%  |

|Trubbish          |45 |
|**Koffing**       |22 |
|Yungoos           |20 |
|Poochyena         |13 |

There is a hidden *Potion* in the first rock on top, and a *Green Shard* in the box in the top right.

At the top of the area during the morning and day, you'll find a Litleo, who will run off.

At night, you'll see two Mightyena's bullying **Electrike**, who will join you if you can defeat them.

To the left of the area, a **Minun** or a **Plusle** will pop out and join you if you give it snax. You can get both by exiting and re-entering.

If this is a bit too hard for now feel free to skip this one, but if you enter the Underground Railnet from the Obsidia entrance you'll find Litleo and have to fight a strong Pokemon. 

Pokemon Mechanightmare. Field: Cave Field
- Klinklang, Lv. 35, Ability: Clear Body, Modest Nature, IVs: 30
    - Discharge
    - Charge Beam
    - Mirror Shot
    - Autotomize

If you're able to defeat this thing, you'll get **Litleo**!

With all that out of the way, return to the park area and talk to Victoria, Amaria, and Florinia. Head into Obsidia Park. Note that once we are done here we can't re-enter, so if you want the hidden items and such grab them while we're here. All of the Pokemon will be available later, though.

Obsidia Park

|**Sunflora**      |5  |
|Slakoth           |5  |
|**Bonsly**        |5  |

Head to the left and grab an *Oran Berry* in the third bush. Grab the *Poke Ball* beyond the first grunt then go right. A bush here will contain a *Chesto Berry*. Cut the wiggly tree and backtrack. Cut another wiggly tree near the entrance and follow the path. After passing the grey street twice the first bush will contain a *Leppa Berry*. Cut this wiggly tree.

Again we are backtracking to go through the middle path to cut a wiggly tree, then through the left path. Following the newly opened area up, grab a *Pecha Berry* in a bush, then head right to cut a wiggly tree to open up a shortcut!

To the right, you can cut another and follow its path to a fight with a grunt. Straight down from here is a hidden *Super Potion*! Follow the path to watch a scene, but a wiggly tree then head back and up at the road. A bush past the road hides a *Green Shard*.

Cut two more wiggly trees. Before we head left, we can actually sneak up past a tree to reach a building: inside, you'll find *TM54 False Swipe* and the *Warehouse Key*. Back outside, follow a path straight to the left to obtain an *X Sp. Def*  

Back down from here, follow the leftward path. In the second rock you'll find an *Antidote*. Use the Light Shard if you'd like, then prepare for a battle!

Meteor Admin ZEL. Field: Forest Field
- PULSE Tangrowth, Lv. 22, Ability: Filter, Calm Nature, IVs: 7. Stat Spread: 100/70/200/10/70/160. Typing: Grass/Poison
    - Wrap
    - Vine Whip
    - Acid Spray
    - Mega Drain

This is our first battle with a PULSE! As you can see from its stats (HP/Atk/Def/Spe/SpA/SpD) Tangrowth is pretty slow, which luckily means you can take the chance to cripple it with paralysis or stat debuffs. It doesn't hit too hard either, so your Pokemon will likely be able to live a few turns before being knocked out. The difficulty lies in its combination of Acid Spray and Mega Drain, as it likes to weaken you then heal back to full. Making sure that you're dealing more damage than it is able to heal will be the key here.

Once you succeed, the vines will recede and we'll be back in the park. A bush to the left contains a hidden *Heart Scale* while sneaking around through the bottom right area of the park will lead you to a rock containing an *Exp. Candy M*.

|                  |   |Sunflora          |5  |                  |   |

Catch a Sentret for an in-game trade, and evolve it by raising it to Lv. 15 to get **Furret**. In the house nearby the Pokemon Center, you can trade it to get **Castform**!

While we're nearby, enter the Pokemon center and talk to the mom inside. Tell her where her son is to get an *Ability Capsule*!

Take another visit to the Central Salon and talk to the people inside. Then return to the Glamazonia Salon and talk to the lady, who'll let you take home **Glameow**. They'll also lower their massage price to $1400. That's not all for this quest though, no. Take your Glameow to the Central Salon and show it to the lady on the right; she'll allow us to battle her.

Posh Suzy. Field: No Field
- Tsareena, Lv. 45, Ability: Queenly Majesty, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Synthesis
    - Aromatherapy
    - Play Rough
    - Trop Kick

Obviously this is a pretty tough fight for this point in the game, feel free to return to it later. Maybe a fire type might be able to lower its stats or something since it resists both of its attack moves?

If you're able to win, you'll get **Bounsweet**!

Heading north from the park, all the way right from the manhole cover you can find a hidden *Super Potion*. 

The first building here is the Department Store. Head inside, we can buy some things.

Our Pokemon have been getting random EV's so far - if you in the future want to EV train your Pokemon, you can buy these to make the process easier. In Reborn, 20 EVs per berry are lowered instead of the canon 10. Don't worry about them for now - EV training will become a lot easier later on.

Outside, head left and grab hidden *Cotton Candy* and *Red Shard* in some rocks. That's pretty much all we can do in Obsidia for now, but before we continue the story we can take a brief detour back to Coral Ward for some goodies.

The warehouse key we got earlier works on three of the warehouses here. In the left one, you'll find the real daycare couple! By freeing them, the daycare will now be in service for all your breeding needs.

The second warehouse contains a *Macho Brace* as well as **Spoink** randomly hiding in one of the boxes. The third warehouse contains a Meteor Grunt. Talking to him allows us to get a Pokemon later on. Also in here is a **Happiny**!

## Onyx Ward

Head up into Onyx Ward from the northeastern corner of Obsidia. Onyx Ward is pretty small, but there are some things we can do here before challenging the gym.

Head up on the right side. Across from the third lamppost on the sidewalk you can find a hidden *Cheri Berry*. Making your way around to the top left corner past the front of the school, the second tile from the left contains a hidden *Antidote*. The rock below contains a *Carbos* and the rock down from here contains a *Pokesnax*. 

Anyways, we can't yet enter the Move Relearner house, so enter the apartment to the right. Talk to the girl on the left twice - for saving the Daycare couple, she'll give us an egg! It will be one of the following, determined randomly: **Clauncher**, **Seel**, **Remoraid**, **Spheal**, **Clamperl**, or **Frillish**. That's all here for now, so head next door to the game corner.

|*Max Revive*   |2 Matches     |
|*Full Restore* |1 Matches     |

We don't have a Coin Case yet, so there's not much to do yet. We can play the lottery once a day though. 

Enter the trainer school at the top left entrance. Fern will lock us out, so head outside and defeat the trainer to enter the school at the top right entrance.

This area is mostly linear with a few detours. Talk to every green bookshelf and stray green book that you find lying around - they'll give us lore as well as the answers to some questions we'll need to answer later on.

In the first door upstairs, a guy will give you the *Coin Case*! The next room contains *Protective Pads*. The room after that contains a *Quick Claw*. Talk to a guy staring at the wall in the hallway from the right to open up a door to the left.

In this door, go to the left. Here you'll find the first move tutors.

Onyx Trainer School Move Tutor 1

|Move           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|Iron Defense   |$1000      |
|Snore          |$500       |
|Bind           |$500       |
|Spite          |$250       |

It's worth noting that every move tutor in the game will only charge you once per move - so don't feel bad about deleting a tutor move once you've learned it once since you can go get it back for free.

Onyx Trainer School Move Tutor 2

|Move           |Price      |

Head upstairs to grab the *Desert Field Readout*!

Head downstairs from here, head out to the main hall and go downstairs again.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Hardy)
- No (Neutral)

Enter the door above and to the right and talk to the girl for a *Telluric Seed*. Unlock this gate for a backtrack shortcut.

Head to the left. Defeat these trainers then head into the room on the left. Time for another rival battle.

Swag Jockey Fern (2x Super Potion). Field: 
- Sandile, Lv. 23, Ability: Moxie, Bashful Nature, IVs: 20
    - Mud-Slap
    - Bite
    - Sand Attack
    - Rage
- Roselia, Lv. 24, Ability: Poison Point, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Leech Seed
    - Stun Spore
    - Mega Drain
    - Poison Sting
- Dartrix, Lv. 25, Ability: Overgrow, Bashful Nature, IVs: 28
    - Pluck
    - Razor Leaf
    - Ominous Wind
    - Nature Power

Fern can be tough to defeat now that his Budew and Rowlet have evolved. Roselia likes to try to tank your attacks and heal back thanks to Leech Seed and Mega Drain, while Dartrix tries to hit hard with its STABs or go for an omniboost. Sandile can sweep with Moxie if you're not careful, so lead with something that can handle it and you should be fine.

Before we continue to the gym, now is a good time to wrap up a couple of quests and areas. 

First, head on over to the Arcade. With our Coin Case, we can now go to town here. Note that by interacting with NPC's and random tiles throughout, you can pick up 1065 Coins for free.

Onyx Arcade Coin Shop

|Item       |Price          |
|-----------|---------------|
|50 Coins   |$1000          |
|500 Coins  |$10000         |

Unless you're coming back here really late in the game, don't buy coins. They're way too expensive and by playing Voltorb Flip, you can get them for free. You can also play the slots or the roulette... but these are really slow and Voltorb Flip is 100% the way to go here. The magic number to get all the rewards is 23900 Coins.

Speaking of Voltorb Flip, here are the tips I recommend as a long time Voltorb Flip Player:

1. You can use a calculator to get started with learning what optimal moves are, but in general your coins over time is best served by just playing the game quickly yourself. Even when you lose, it's not too hard to pick back up and try again, even if you get shot all the way down to Level 1. 
2. The game often forces you to make guesses, sometimes 50-50 guesses even. Try to make the guesses that have the least chance of failure first when you find yourself in a no-guarantees situation.
3. Any row (or column, I will call them rows for simplicity) that adds up to 5 can be entirely ignored since there are no 2's and 3's. The only times you should intentionally flip 1's are when you are 100% sure they are not Voltorbs and simply want to make the board have less unflipped tiles.
4. Any rows without Voltorb should be flipped immediately. When there are no such rows... just make your best guess as to where 2's and 3's are in the rows with the least Voltorb probabilities and go from there.
5. It is crucial that you learn what the remaining point values in a row is. For example, in a row with 8/2V, suppose you have flipped one tile and it is a 3. Then in 4 remaining spots, two are Voltorb, so the other two sum to 5. This means one is a 2 and one is a 3, meaning you can try to pick which columns can fit the 2 at that spot and which could fit the 3. Alternatively, in a 5/1V, the minute you see a 2 flipped, you are done, since the rest can then only be 1 or Voltorb.
6. Have fun! It is a bit frustrating when you get to Level 7 and then immediately flip a Voltorb, going all the way back. But the most important thing is fun - remember you can come back later to play and get the rewards.

Onyx Arcade TM Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*TM45 Attract*     |1000 Coins |
|*TM42 Facade*      |4000 Coins |
|*TM90 Substitute*  |7000 Coins |

Of these, Substitute is probably the best one, but you can certainly get some mileage out of the other two with the right Pokemon.

Onyx Arcade Pokemon Shop

|Pokemon        |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|**Snover**     |600 Coins  |
|**Slugma**     |1000 Coins |
|**Mantyke**    |1800 Coins |
|**Nidoran M**  |3500 Coins |
|**Shinx**      |5000 Coins |

Even if you're not interested in getting everything here, most of these Pokemon are good for the upcoming gym. If the egg we previously got was Remoraid, you can get Mantyke and immediately evolve it which is neat. Nidoran M also can immediately evolve twice with the Moon Stone we got earlier. Snover can generate Snow Warning if you'd like to use that to your advantage.

Back outside, head into the building to the left. Fern's friend will feel bad and let us access the rooftop garden. Up here you'll find *TM63 Embargo*.

Onyx Ward Rooftop

|Land              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Bellsprout        |35 |
|**Tranquill**     |25 |
|Pidove            |20 |
|Spearow           |10 |
|Venonat           |10 |

When the weather is clear up here, you can also find a **Pichu** behind a tree if you have snax in your bag.

Finally, now is a good time to go finish the search for Lillipup.

After talking to it in the apartment in South Obsidia Ward it will randomly go to one of these five places:

- On the second pier from the top in Coral Ward
- To the left and up from the Central Salon in Obsidia Ward
- Between the Panpour / Pansear area and the Railnet in Opal Ward
- At the very north point of Peridot Ward by the closed gate
- In the northwest corner of Peridot Ward, nearby the apartment containing Snubbull / Stufful

Once you find it, head back to the Onyx Ward. To the left of the Move Relearner house, you'll see the owner with it. You can then obtain **Lillipup**.

## Canopy Badge

With all that out of the way we can head back to the gym. In order to battle Florinia, we're gonna need to answer all the quiz questions. The answers are here, from right to left:

> 1
> 367
> True
> 410
> True
> 37
> 15
> True

Head to the left and enter the gym room for a battle.

Head Instructor Florinia (2x Super Potion). Field: Desert Field
- Maractus, Lv. 22, Ability: Water Absorb, Quirky Nature, IVs: 1
    - Nature Power
    - Pin Missile
    - Needle Arm
    - Spikes
- Cottonee, Lv. 24, Ability: Prankster, Impish Nature, IVs: 25
    - Leech Seed
    - Poison Powder
    - Nature Power
    - Protect
- Ferroseed, Lv. 22, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Iron Barbs, IVs: 5
    - Leech Seed
    - Nature Power
    - Pin Missile
    - Sandstorm
- Breloom, Lv. 23, Ability: Poison Heal, Bashful Nature, IVs: 1
    - Leech Seed
    - Spore
    - Mach Punch
    - Mega Drain
- Cacnea, Lv. 23, @Big Root, Ability: Sand Veil, Adamant Nature, IVs: 15
    - Sand Attack
    - Pin Missile
    - Leech Seed
    - Nature Power
- Cradily, Lv. 24, Ability: Suction Cups, Careful Nature, IVs: 15
    - Stockpile
    - Smack Down
    - Recover
    - Sandstorm

This is a pretty neat and out of the ordinary team that helps teach the player about the versatility of field effects. In general, the Desert Field actually doesn't really benefit Grass types or most grass type moves. Regardless, Florinia's team is mostly built around using the field successfully. Specifically, Needle Arm, Pin Missile, and Sand Tomb are all boosted by the field, and most of her Pokemon have access to these moves. Cacnea's Sand Veil is always activated here, and Ferroseed's Telluric Seed allows it to gain a bit more bulk and speed in exchange for being trapped by Sand Tomb. Sandstorm lasts for eight turns on the field, and Ferroseed, Cacnea, and Cradily will all be immune to its damage while you may not. Cradily also gets a Special Defense boost from the sand, adding to its already strong bulk with Stockpile and Recover. On top of all that, Nature Power turns into boosted Sand Tomb, and Cottonee has priority on this move due to Prankster!

All that goes to show how even fields that aren't *obviously* beneficial like Electric Terrain for Julia can lead to difficult teams. Aside from Pin Missile Linoone you don't really have many options to abuse the field yourself yet, so the key will be to overwhelming her. Fury Cutter is a pretty great move for this fight - you can get around Ferroseed's Iron Barbs with the Protective Pads we found earlier, and after a few uses the move will tear through Cradily before it can bulk up. Snover is also a good option if you want to cancel out the Sandstorm with a different weather condition, or you could use Castform's Sunny Day to sweep with Fire moves under the 8-turn Desert Field sun. You could also try to run a Flying-type offensive core, which ignores Sand Tomb and can pretty easily deal with everything except Cradily. You might have to think outside the box a little but this fight is fun to figure out, and you can do it.

After winning you'll get the *Canopy Badge* as well as *TM96 Nature Power*. You'll also receive the *PULSE Dex* as well as the *PULSE 5C Readout*. The level cap also shoots up to 35!

# Appendices

## Full Password List

I don't recommend reading this list until you've played through the game once - the passwords in the readme are usually sufficient for first-time playthroughs, and this list is pretty comprehensive and spoils some gameplay elements. Regardless, I have listed every password and its effect below:
