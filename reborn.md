# Episode 1: Reborn, the City of Ruin

Welcome to my 100% walkthrough. I love this game, I hope you will too, and I hope this walkthrough can help you if you get stuck or if you want to collect everything that you can in the game.

My aim with this document is to provide a complete route through the game including every single item including hidden ones, available Pokemon, some tips for battle strategies, shop and tutor details, and more. To summarize my approach: if you're the type of person that doesn't really like having tons of tabs open at once while you're trying to 100% complete this game, hopefully my guide may be useful for you.

Since this guide is complete, there are some parts that may spoil events that happen later in the game. I try to be vague about these things, but you may want to consider playing the game once first without referencing this walkthrough if this is a concern.

## All Aboard!

The game will first ask you to choose a player character and gender. It will then ask you if you want to view controls. You can actually rebind controls with F1 and even add controller support! Once you've gotten acquainted with your chosen controls, you'll find yourself on the train.

Ame will ask you if you have any special instructions or passwords. From the game's readme:

<div id="quote">
    <p> At the start of the game, you will be prompted for special instructions, or passwords. Below is a list of applicable passwords. Please note that these are features are considered a bonus, and may have some  unexpected interactions at times... 
    </p><br><br>
    <p>Implement a hard EXP cap when maxed on badges, similar to Pokemon Rejuvenation: </p><br>
        <ul><li>Password: hardcap</li></ul><br>
    <p>Cause randomized early game Pokemon events to bias towards a specific type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Password: mononormal</li>
            <li>Password: monofire</li>
            <li>Password: monowater</li>
            <li>Password: monograss</li>
            <li>Password: monoelectric</li>
            <li>Password: monoice</li>
            <li>Password: monofighting</li>
            <li>Password: monopoison</li>
            <li>Password: monoground</li>
            <li>Password: monoflying</li>
            <li>Password: monobug</li>
            <li>Password: monopsychic</li>
            <li>Password: monorock</li>
            <li>Password: monoghost</li>
            <li>Password: monodragon</li>
            <li>Password: monodark</li>
            <li>Password: monosteel</li>
            <li>Password: monofairy</li>
        </ul><br>
    <p>Prevent Pokemon from being healed after their HP drops to 0:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nuzlocke</li></ul><br>
    <p>Randomly reshuffles species and moves as rolled at game start:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: randomizer</li></ul><br>
    <p>Pokemon do not need to know HM (TMX) moves in order to use them in the field:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: easyhms</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Prohibits the player's use of items in trainer battles:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: noitems</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 252 EVs and 31 IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: fullevs</li></ul><br>
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 0 EVs and IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: litemode</li></ul><br>    
    <p>Makes all Field	Notes visible immediately</p>
        <ul><li>Password: allfieldapp</li></ul><br>
    <p>Remove some randomness by making all attacks do consistent damage rather than a roll:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nodamageroll</li></ul><br>
    <p>Multiple passwords, including differing monotypes, may be used in tandem with 
    each other, but progress at your own risk~</p><br><br>
    <p>Other hidden passwords may be able to be found in the game.</p>
</div>

If this is your first time playing, don't worry too much about passwords - in fact you can activate passwords later on into the game if you'd like. 

If you want some of my opinions on these passwords:

- If you want to do a challenge run, try one of the *mono\[type\]* passwords. It doesn't enforce any explicit rules for battle, it simply guarantees you suitable Pokemon for random events. I love to do monotype runs (for example, [here's one I have already completed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonReborn/comments/uh5wnk/i_cleared_the_entirety_of_e19_with_only_water/) ) so I really recommend trying one of these especially for a second playthrough.
- I don't prefer these personally, but you can do *nuzlocke* or *randomizer* if you'd like, just note that Nuzlocke doesn't enforce a first-mon-per-area rule explicitly. You can even do both at the same time.
- *hardcap* lets you avoid disobeying via overlevelling, and *easyhms* allows you to use HM's without teaching them to your Pokemon.  I think it is worthwhile to play the game without these two to get the "classic" reborn experience at least once, but if you know you'd prefer the quality of life that comes with these passwords feel free to use them.
- *noitems* makes it so you can't use in battle items like Potion and X-Attack. I prefer this for the extra difficulty it provides and how it increases the value of moves like Recover.
- *nodamagerolls* makes it so moves will always roll the same damage. There are some fights in this game you practically must reset for a couple times at least, so minimizing the randomness is in my opinion pretty handy.
- *fullevs* ramps up the difficulty significantly by making every Pokemon both hit hard and have some bulk. I only recommend this for players with experience.
- *allfieldapp* lets you see data about fields from the start. If you're following this guide I'll be picking up all the notes naturally anyways, so unless you really want to know right away how each field works you'll be ok skipping this one.
- *litemode* is a good choice if you are struggling or want to experience the wonderful characters, world, and puzzles without as much emphasis on battling prowess.

Regardless, *this guide will be from the perspective of a player who is using no passwords.* 

After you're done inputting passwords, enjoy the rest of your train ride!

## Grand Hall

As soon as you're off the train, you'll have a conversation with Ame and Julia. I won't be explaining story events much at all in this walkthrough. This conversation does quietly show off a mechanic in Pokemon Reborn: relationship points! Certain dialogue triggers and events will make certain characters like you more or less. What do they do? [Ame's Devblog post](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/development/records/about-relationship-points-r83/) explains it pretty well, so you can read that to decide if you want to care about them or not. Whenever a choice is not listed, it has no effect on the points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Yes (+1 Julia)

Immediately down from your starting position, in a rock you'll find a hidden *Normal Gem*. There are tons of hidden items in this game, and we won't get the Itemfinder for another two badges or so. I will try my best to explain the positions of all the hidden items that I can until then.

Heading to the right, you'll see a black and green streetsign. Two tiles to the right is a pile of trash containing a hidden *Poke Ball*. To the right you'll find a manhole cover - on the left side is a hidden *Red Shard*. Shards will actually be pretty useful in Reborn for obtaining Ability Capsules and Pokemon as well as learning moves via tutors.

Proceed to the right into Opal Ward. A girl at the bottom of the area will give you a *Potion*. In general, talk to as many people in Reborn as you can - they offer helpful tips for battles, give you useful items, etc.

If the weather is sunny you will see an Ice Cream Cart here.

**Opal Ward Ice Cream Shop**

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$600       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$800       |
|*Blue Moon Ice Cream*\*|$20000     |

Every day the Ice Cream Shop appears, there is a 1 in 21 chance that they will be selling the rare Blue Moon Ice Cream. If you talk to them and they are not, then they will not carry Blue Moon Ice Cream until the next sunny day. However, if you save before speaking to them, you can reset the game until they are carrying Blue Moon Ice Cream. It is too expensive for us right now by far, but should you ever want to buy it keep this trick in mind.

Talk to the girl in front of the big building here, and you'll head in. Welcome to the Grand Hall.

Upstairs, you'll be asked which starter Pokemon you'd like to get. You actually get to choose between 21 starters, or you can let fate decide by using the computer at the top of the room. One amazing thing about Reborn is that you can obtain every single Pokemon in the first seven generations within a single savefile of Reborn without trading, and that includes the starters. So, regardless of which you pick, you'll be able to get the other 20 eventually. Your choices are:
- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**

One amazing feature that Pokemon Reborn has is that it doesn't arbitrarily lock each Pokemon's 'hidden' ability behind weird methods. Every Pokemon has an equal chance of having its Hidden Ability as its normal abilities regardless of how you obtain them. That means you can get Intimidate Litten, Sheer Force Totodile, Contrary Snivy and more right now. It is ultimately up to you what you choose of course. Many players recommend Torchic due to its Speed Boost ability, but each starter can be useful in its own way.

If you save in front of the starters (quicksave is, by default, 'D'), you can reset (resetting is, by default, F12. You will become very familiar with this button.) until you get one with satisfactory nature, ability, IV's, and even shininess. The shiny rate in this game is roughly 1 in 91 in this game, so you might just end up with a shiny starter on your first try!

Talk to Ame as soon as you're done, and you'll be taken downstairs and fight your first battle!

**Pretty Boy Cain. Field: No Field**
- Nidoran M., Lv. 5, Ability: Hustle, Bashful Nature, IVs: 3
    - Tackle
    - Leer
  
Use your starter's stat lowering move once if you'd like then spam your attacking move and hopefully you can win. Note that winning this one is not required. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Cain in battle (+1 Cain)

Once you are done with that battle, you'll be healed, then thrust into another without changing things up. While this isn't too bad right now, this will happen more in this game. One thing I should note is that if you spam the quicksave key specifically while a character is moving, you can save between battles. 

**Apprentice Victoria. Field: No Field**
- Litten, Lv. 5, Ability: Blaze, Bashful Nature, IVs: 10
    - Scratch
    - Growl

You'll be Lv. 6 now if you won the last one. Use a similar strategy and hopefully you'll come out on top. Note that again winning this one is not required.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Victoria in battle (+1 Victoria)

After the battle, Ame will give you the *Pokedex*, the *Pokegear,* and of course the *Running Shoes*! Plus, Victoria will give you 5 *Poke Balls*.

Now, we can explore the Grand Hall. This is the region's hub building - we will be checking back here often. 

Talk to the guy in the top left - he will tell us about the password *litemode*. We already knew about this one from the readme, but you can enter it in the future if you'd like.

A guy behind the desk will allow us to bring in grinding trainers to the grand hall. Right now they're a bit too tough for us, but we can come back a bit before the gym leader to grind later.

Talk to a guy next to some display cases if you'd like to buy some candy.

**Grand Hall Common Candy Shop**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy* | $75       |

As you might guess, Common Candies are the opposite of rare candies - they'll decrease your Pokemon's level. If you're not doing hardcap, they can help us keep your Pokemon under the level cap, thus obeying your commands. Note that the current level cap is 20 - until we beat the gym leader, Pokemon won't obey at Lv. 21 and beyond. We shouldn't need any common candies right now though. To his right is another shop:

**Default Shop**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

In this guide I will be catching every single Pokemon as soon as it becomes available, so if you're going to do the same you're gonna need a lot of balls. As in the mainline games, you get a *Premier Ball* with every 10 balls you purchase. In a pinch we can almost always safely return to a Pokemon Center, so buying Potions and Antidotes may be just to save time for now. 

You can also get a single *Potion* in the PC storage.

On your way out the door, you'll see two people right by the exit. One of them will offer you a Pokemon for $500. But when you do, someone will steal it! If you want to skip this event for now until you have more money you can - we won't actually get to have this Pokemon for... 14 more badges.

That's all we can really do in the Grand Hall for now, so head outside.

## Opal Ward

Note that for now I will not be listing the teams of all of the rando trainers scattered around the region - that would be a lot of content that might not be so useful. If you would like to see the regular trainers, let me know.

Anyways, there is grass here, which means we can obtain new team members! I will be **bolding** any Pokemon that are new.

**Opal Ward**

|Land (Morning/Day)|%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Rattata**       |30 |**Rattata**       |30 |
|**Bidoof**        |30 |**Meowth**        |20 |
|**Patrat**        |15 |**Ekans**         |20 |
|**Pidgey**        |15 |**Hoothoot**      |17 |
|**Meowth**        |5  |**Spinarak**      |13 |
|**Ekans**         |5  |                  |   |

Specifically I recommend training up Bidoof as soon as possible - it gets Headbutt at Level 13, which allows you to catch Pokemon in trees. We will also be able to trade away Bibarel for a different Pokemon pretty soon, so that's something to keep in mind. There is also an in-game trade for Watchog a little bit down the road, so you may want to consider at least catching a Patrat for now.

On the left side of the area, in the left broken statue you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*.

Talk to the trainer here with the Snubbull or Stufful, and they will leave. Back at the bottom of the area, you'll now be able to fight trainers to get onto Opal Bridge. I will be going from the left side, clockwise around the bridge. 

Head up and to the left, beating the trainers as you go. A rock in the top left corner contains a hidden *Awakening*. To the right, you'll fight a Gentleman. All the way down from him and one tile to the left contains a hidden *Blue Shard*.

To the right, you'll find three bullies. You'll need two Pokemon to be able to fight the last two, so catch a second if you haven't yet. When you win, you'll get **Pachirisu** or **Zigzagoon**, randomly determined. Note that whenever there is a random event like this, you will be able to get the other one(s) later in the game. The *monoelectric* password would guarantee Pachirisu, for example, while *mononormal* would guarantee Zigzagoon. If you got Zigzagoon, you can train that up instead of Bidoof if you'd like for Headbutt which it learns at level 11. Another note is that it might be worthwhile to save before you get the Pokemon: both of these can have the Pickup ability, which can be incredible in Pokemon Reborn. [Click here for details about Pickup in Reborn.](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/pickup/)

The first rock you see down from here contains a hidden *Antidote*. After defeating the trainers that's pretty much all we can do here, so head back towards the train station.

## Lower Peridot Ward

In the Lower Peridot Ward, things have opened up! Head up as soon as you can. A rock on the left side will contain a hidden *Escape Rope*. Talk to the guy here, and give him $150 total. We can't do anything in the house behind him quite yet, so head up from here. 

You'll find a gym here. We can't go in yet, but if you go up and around to the right, you'll find a *Gift Box*. 

Also, specifically when the weather is thunderstorming, you'll find **Blitzle** here. Since it's Lv. 15 it might be a bit too tough to deal with right now, so you can come back later. Note that this is the first encounter that is only possible with the right weather - if you'd like to avoid having to wait you can use the *weathermod* password at your next opportunity.

To the left, you'll find a couple of black and green street signs. All the way down and one tile to the right of the top-left sign, you'll find a hidden *Paralyze Heal*. 

To the left, you'll find another Pokemon Center. The rock just outside to the left contains a hidden *Elemental Seed*. Hang on to this for now - it will be useful later on. In a house to the left, you can take a quiz to find out what kind of Pokemon you'd be, just for fun. Enneagram? Myers-Briggs? Nah. *This* is the real personality quiz.

Anyways, down and to the right from here you'll find some more trainers. During a clear daytime, you'll find a Teddiursa! It will run off and we'll have to chase it. 

Immediately above this intersection you'll find a pile of trash paper on the left side, between two girders. One tile up and one tile right from that contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

There's nothing else here for now, so head down and left from this area and enter the first house that you can. Inside, you'll find a *PokeSnax*! This item is crucial for getting certain Pokemon. Back outside, go one tile left and all the way down. In the final tile you can stand on is a hidden *Exp. Candy XS*. 

Head back up and to the right, and you'll find another trainer. The building directly above him has a pile of trash paper to its right, which contains a hidden *Blue Shard*. Up from here, in a box you can find a hidden *Common Candy*. Since we are holding the snax, talk to the dumpster next to it to catch **Gulpin**. Inside the house, also thanks to the snax, you'll be able to catch **Whismur**. 

Return to the guy we gave money to - behind him in a house you will find **Minccino** or **Espurr**, randomly determined. With the snax in your bag, it will join you! 

Head to the left of the Pokemon center, and go down. In the top of two trash paper tiles you can find a *Poison Gem*. In a house below, a guy will give you the *Old Rod*! 

Back outside, we can actually fish in the dirty water.

**Lower Peridot Ward / Peridot Ward**

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Grimer**        |100|

You can talk to the group below if you'd like, but you can't do anything here quite yet. To the right, you'll find a building to the left and up of the snax house. Inside, you'll be able to battle a guy. If you win, he'll let you into his pool, where you can find a *Sea Incense*.

**Peridot Ward Pool**

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Goldeen**       |70 |
|**Finneon**       |30 |

Head out, and back up past the rod guy's house. You'll find the Name Rater's house here. Up from here, the first barrel you see will hide a *Heart Scale*. Straight to the left and down between the two brown buildings you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*. 

If it is still a clear daytime, here you'll be able to talk to Teddiursa again, who will run off to a random location. I will cover all the locations later on, but keep in mind finding it three times from here will allow you to battle and catch it.

Enter the building here and talk to the old man for a battle. If you win, you'll be able to enter his garden. 

**Lower Peridot Ward / Peridot Ward**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Ledyba**        |30 |**Caterpie**      |30 |Hoothoot          |30 |
|**Cherubi**       |24 |**Wurmple**       |30 |Spinarak          |24 |
|**Wurmple**       |20 |**Sunkern**       |30 |**Wurmple**       |20 |
|**Caterpie**      |20 |**Cherubi**       |10 |**Caterpie**      |20 |
|**Sunkern**       |6  |                  |   |**Sunkern**       |6  |

There is a trade for Sunkern we can do later on, so I recommend catching one.

Back outside, head to the right. Enter the first building here. You'll find out about an injured Skitty - when we get an Oran Berry we will be back. Head outside and go right.

You'll fight a trainer in a small park. Once you beat her, talk to her again for a *Rose Incense*. A rock below her in the park contains an *Antidote*, and down and to the left from here you'll find a *Paralyze Heal* hidden in a box.

Back up from here, enter the building. Talk to the guy here and give him the Gift Box we found earlier, and you'll obtain a **Delibird**! The building to the right of this one contains an ailing **Kricketot** which you can obtain by talking to the person here. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Accept Kricketot (+1 Shelly)
- Reject Kricketot (-1 Shelly)

Kricketune with its Fury Cutter attack and Technician ability can be incredible in the early game, so consider using it.

Back outside, talk to the yellow haired guy for a battle. When you beat him you can access the Lower Peridot Alley.

**Lower Peridot Alley**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Trubbish**      |60 |
|**Stunky**        |22 |
|**Poochyena**     |18 |

Poochyena evolves early and can have the Moxie ability, so it can be fantastic in the early game.

To the right of the blue bin is a hidden *Dark Gem*. After defeating the trainer on the left you'll get a *Super Potion*. During thunderstorms specifically, you'll be able to get **Tynamo**!

Head outside and go to the right under the bridge. When the weather is rainy, you'll find **Pansear** or **Panpour**, randomly determined. The second from the right box on the bottom row contains a *Purple Shard*. Head to the right.

**Underground Railnet (Opal Area)**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Noibat**        |74 |
|**Woobat**        |20 |
|Stunky            |6  |

Woobat can be pretty solid if you evolve it early thanks to its Simple ability.

Plus, a rock at the top left contains a hidden *Guard Spec.* Once you're done here, head back to the left and go up past Seacrest's Garden to enter the northern part of Peridot Ward.

## Peridot Ward

Between two boxes on the left, you can find a hidden *Poke Ball*. In a rock up and to the right from here is a hidden *Oran Berry*. That means we can head back down and enter the first building on the right to get **Skitty**. 

Head back up, then go left. To the left of the factory there is a barrel containing an *Ability Capsule*! Make sure you get it soon because it will eventually become unobtainable.

To the right of here is a trainer with a red hat. Depending on where he challenges you you may need to go around, but between a rock and a barrel above him you'll find a hidden *Burn Heal*. The barrel on the other side of this small building contains a hidden *Red Shard* The in-game trade I mentioned earlier is in this house, but we probably aren't quite ready for it yet, so head up.

Up and to the left of the rock above the street sign you can find a hidden *Blue Shard*, and straight up from here the top of two boxes contains a *Paralyze Heal*. Up from here go left, then in a rock behind a dumpster you can get a hidden *Calcium*. I really recommend selling it for a clean $4900 - if you haven't noticed the trainers in this area don't give you much money.

Defeat the youngsters here and enter this house. A lady will tell you she is afraid of some muggers who aren't here yet, so we can head outside. The fountain out here will actually contain **Surskit** when it is raining. Two tiles down from the left part of the manhole cover here you can find a hidden *Ether*. 

Up from here, when the weather is clear or sunny, as long as you are holding Rose Incense you can catch a falling **Budew**. A rock above contains a *Potion* and one to the left contains a *Red Shard*.

Inside this house you'll find the guy who stole our Pokemon earlier, but you gotta pay another $500! Just kidding, you gotta fight both him and the initial salesman and you won't even get your Pokemon. We'll just have to continue this quest later.

Head down and enter the tall building to your right. Inside two suspicious people will see you and run off. Back in the Igglybuff lady's house you'll have to defeat them. Once you do, you can get **Igglybuff**! It's worth noting that she will eventually ask for this specific Igglybuff back later in the game, and if you want the non-unique rewards, you'll need to give it back. So, if you want the rewards but want to use the Jigglypuff line, consider breeding it once we get daycare access. Anyways, to the right of the tall building you can defeat another blonde haired guy to get access to another alleyway.

**North Peridot Alley**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Trubbish          |45 |
|Poochyena         |34 |
|**Purrloin**      |21 |

In a jar to the left you can find a *Repel*. A box above will contain a *Green Shard*. Our first *Data Chip* is above. You can use it to add a password at any PC, if you'd like.

Outside, enter the small building to the left and pickup the *Potion*. Outside, head straight to the left, and enter the first building. At night, you can catch **Grubbin** or **Joltik**, randomly determined. Note that this will use up one of your snax, so you'll need to buy more to do other snax-related events.

Straight to the left out the door you'll find some trash paper, and to the left of it is a hidden *Common Candy*. Inside the next building is another *Common Candy*. 

The "Default Shops" in this game operate similarly to main Pokemon game shops in that they update their inventory based on how many badges you have - the Peridot Ward one will have the same inventory as the Grand Hall one until we get a badge, then they will both upgrade. 

Anyways, a small house up from here contains a *Protein*, which again I recommend selling for more ball money. Outside to the right in a box is a hidden *Potion*. A pile of trash paper in the very top left contains a hidden *Clever Wing* (which, again, is good to sell). A guy in the adjacent building will give us a *Common Candy*. Outside there is a shop.

**Peridot Ward Snax Shop**

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|*PokeSnax* |$650       |

If you use up your PokeSnax and need more, this is the place. Note that he won't be here unless the weather is clear or sunny. 

In the "Jasper" gate here you can find a *Genius Wing* in a rock. Outside you'll find a hidden *Green Shard* a tile to the right of the pair of trash paper tiles. To the right past the trainer a rock contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

Now that we've completed this loop, head back to the bottom left corner of the area. Inside both sides of the dumpster you'll find a *Blue Shard* and *Common Candy*. 

When you're ready, talk to the green haired guy for a battle.

**Swag Jockey Fern (Potion). Field: No Field**
- Budew, Lv. 13, @Oran Berry, Ability: Poison Point, IVs: 10
    - Mega Drain
    - Natural Gift
    - Stun Spore
    - Covet
- Sandile, Lv. 13, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 10
    - Power Trip
    - Snatch
    - Rage
    - Sand Tomb
- Rowlet, Lv. 14, Ability: Overgrow, IVs: 15
    - Leafage
    - Peck
    - Ominous Wind
    - Confuse Ray

This one is a bit harder than the first two rival fights of course, but nothing you can't handle. Watch out for his Budew, who likes to heal, and his Sandile who can rip through your team of six thanks to Moxie if you're not careful.

Around this time, my Bidoof was able to learn Headbutt, so there are a few Pokemon you can now obtain. First, head to the garden:

**Lower Peridot Ward / Peridot Ward**

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Swablu**        |55 |
|**Burmy**         |45 |

Note that we will eventually want a Mothim for an in-game trade, so ensure you catch a Male Burmy at some point. Next, head back to Opal Ward.

**Opal Ward** 

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Pineco**        |40 |
|**Spearow**       |30 |
|**Combee**        |30 |

Now is a good time to finish the Teddiursa quest if you haven't already. Keep in mind this has to be done on a clear day. After talking to it in the bottom part of the Lower Peridot Ward and then again on the left side near the Name Rater's house, you'll need to find it three more times. It can be found in one of the following locations, then will be found in the two after it in the list (cyclically).

1. Nearby the train station, where we started the game.
2. Under the Opal Bridge, nearby Panpour/Pansear. 
3. Above Mosswater Industrial in between two buildings.
4. Next to the Upper Peridot Ward Pokemart.
5. Next to the rock containing the Calcium near the fountain.
6. Nearby the dumpster where we got Gulpin.
7. In the bottom left corner of Seacrest's garden.

**Teddiursa** will then battle you. 

With that out of the way, time to progress the story. Make sure you have your best team for some battles coming up.

You have to two choices: you can head straight to the Mosswater Industrial above Seacrest's Garden, or take a detour first to the Lower Peridot Ward gym. In either case, talk to the character standing in front of the factory when you're ready.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Headed straight to Mosswater Industrial (Fern +1)
- Detoured to Lower Peridot Gym before going to Mosswater (Julia +1)

## Mosswater Industrial

Time for our first dungeon proper! Fern will join us as a partner. Partners are special in this game for a few reasons. Leaving your partner (here, leaving Mosswater Industrial) has a negative effect:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Leave Fern and exit the factory (-1 Fern, just once)

However, talking to your partner while they're walking with you has a positive effect:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Fern while you are together (+1 Fern, just once)
  
Another cool thing is that partners will heal you after each battle!

Enter the next room and talk with Ace. We'll be wandering around the factory, defeating Team Meteor Grunts and looking for codes. 

To the left across a bridge, you'll see one flashing terminal: XX7X. In the top left you'll find another terminal: X1XX. The three terminals nearby give us some lore that will be relevant later... A terminal to the right shows 3XXX, and the one in the top right corner shows XXX9. Read the other two terminals nearby for more lore, then head down to the elevator and type in our now completed password.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Push the same elevator button as the floor you are on (-1 Fern)

On the second floor, Rini will start us off with part of the second password: XX6X. Before we proceed, head out the door on the bottom right and follow the path to get an *Exp. Candy S*. Back in the main room, head out to the right, and interact with the terminal here to get the hint XXX2, and the other for lore. Head out to the left, and down at the first opportunity. In this room, use the terminal to discover the hint X8XX. Back outside, go left. In here is another terminal: 4XXX, plus one more with some lore. Back outside again, go up at the bridge, pickup *Paralyze Heal*, type in the code and head in. Beat the grunts and pickup the explosives!

Back in the central room, choose which of the two characters to talk to.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Julia after getting the boomies (+1 Julia, -1 Florinia)
- Talk to Florinia after getting the boomies (-1 Julia, +1 Florinia)

Either way, head in to the room at the top when you're ready for a fight.

**Meteor Private Aster & Meteor Private Eclipse. Field: Factory Field**
- Rockruff, Lv. 16, Ability: Steadfast, IVs: 31
    - Thunder Fang
    - Howl
    - Bite
    - Rock Throw
- Rockruff, Lv. 16, Ability: Vital Spirit, IVs: 31
    - Fire Fang
    - Howl
    - Bite
    - Rock Throw

Depending on what Pokemon you have this can be a bit difficult since they like to one-shot Fern's Budew, but your sheer numbers can probably overwhelm them regardless.

Outside the factory, Florinia will ask you a question.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Yes (+1 Florinia)

You will then be given the Field Notes App in your Pokegear, and offered to turn on a graphical feature that shows off field effect boosts in battle. I recommend doing this! You will also be given the *Electric Terrain Readout*. Anyways, if you noticed, we were battling on the Factory Field earlier. Most of the important trainers in this game we will be fighting on these custom field effects, so the Field Notes will be very helpful.

Before we continue with the story, there are a couple quests we can take care of now. 

Go to the factory area where we first met Fern, and talk to the scientist guy on the right side of the factory. He will give us the *Factory Field Readout*, so now we have more details whenever we have battles on the Factory Field that was in Mosswater.

Head down and talk to the purple haired guy above the train station. A hotshot will steal his painkillers! Follow him inside the North Peridot Alley, where you can fight him. Once you defeat him, return to the guy who will give you 5 *Exp. Candy S*. Nice.

By now hopefully you've been able to evolve your Bidoof into **Bibarel** at Lv. 15. If so, head into the house across from Mosswater to do an in-game trade for **Munna**! If not, now is a good time to grind the repeatable trainers in the upper-right corner of the Grand Hall - remember, they will give you Exp. Candy after each battle and even auto-heal your party! You can also do this as you like to do last preparations for the gym.

## Volt Badge

Enter the Neo-Circuit Power-Plant gym when you're ready. Beat all the trainers in this main room, talk to the Voltorb standing behind them, and blow up the barriers one by one. When you're ready, talk to the gym leader in her room.

Cheer Captain Julia (2x Potion). Field: Electric Terrain.
- Minun, Lv. 12, Ability: Minus, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Charge Beam
    - Encore
    - Quick Attack
- Geodude-Alola, Lv. 12, Ability: Galvanize, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Self-Destruct
    - Tackle
    - Charge
    - Rollout
- Voltorb, Lv. 12, Ability: Aftermath, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Explosion
    - Rollout
    - Charge Beam
    - Sonic Boom
- Plusle, Lv. 13, Ability: Lightning Rod, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Charge Beam
    - Encore
    - Quick Attack
- Oricorio-Pom-Pom, Lv. 14, Ability: Dancer, Quirky Nature, IVs: 10
    - Work Up
    - Tailwind
    - Pound
    - Air Cutter
- Electrode, Lv. 15, Ability: Aftermath, Bashful Nature, IVs: 24
    - Charge Beam
    - Sonic Boom
    - Rollout
    - Charge

Pokemon Reborn's first gym leader comes in pretty hot. You'll notice that she mostly uses two strategies across her team: stacking Special Attack with Electric Terrain boosted Charge Beam, and wearing out your Lv. 20 and under Pokemon quickly with Sonic Boom. Her Electrode of course is very fast, and can employ both of these strategies effectively and then take out a chunk of your HP on the way out with Aftermath. Geodude and Voltorb also like to explode, and since the former's is boosted by STAB, Galvanize, and the field... it's gonna hurt. It doesn't help that Oricorio can hit hard and boost the speed of the entire team for a few turns.

Her team luckily isn't super bulky, so trying to get something going with your own sweepers might be the key. Kricketune and Mightyena can really shine here, as well as your second stage starter especially with Torrent / Blaze / Overgrow. The single Elemental Seed we got earlier can grant a Speed boost to the Pokemon holding it, which can be a key component of your strategy. Alternatively, if you got Zigzagoon you can use Mud Sport to destroy the field, making things a bit more even for you.

Once you emerge victorious, you'll be given the *Volt Badge* as well as *TM57 Charge Beam*. TM's are infinite-use, so slap it on anything that can learn it. You also get to go up to Lv. 25 now! Great job completing section 1 of Pokemon Reborn!

# Episode 2: Reap What's Been Sewn

Head outside, and talk to Victoria outside the gym. She'll tell us our next destination is to the east of the Grand Hall.

Before we continue though, there are a couple quests we can complete before we proceed to the next area. 

## 1 Badge Quests

Head nearby the train station in Lower Peridot. While it is raining, if you have a snax in your bag you can give it away to get **Numel**! 

Nearby you'll find a hiker. Talk to him, then talk to the person in the house containing Whismur earlier on. Return to the hiker and follow him to the house to receive **Onix**!

Next, enter the Grand Hall. The Common Candy salesman is now gone but in his place is a person who will give us the *Rainbow Field Readout*. You probably can't do much with this one yet, but once you are able to create the Rainbow Field yourself, you do lots of crazy things in battle on it.

Now that we have a badge, Pokemarts will be updated:

**Default Shop (1 Badge)**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Repel*        |$400       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

Having a couple repels never hurts, but money is still scarce and catching them all is an expensive task, so I still recommend focusing mostly on balls.

You'll also notice that there are more trainers on Opal Bridge - when you get a new badge, this often happens, so watch out!

## Obsidia Ward

When you're ready, talk to Victoria on the right side of Opal Bridge. New area time!

Head into the Central Salon. Inside, you'll find a friendship checker as well as a groomer who will raise your Pokemon's friendship for $1500. Do this once if you have the money. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Get at least one massage at the Central Salon (+1 Serra)

A lady on the right will ask to see a Pokemon with maximum friendship. Your starter is likely here by now if it's stayed in your party the whole game so far, you've done all the sidequests, and you haven't let it faint too much. If you do show her one, you'll get the *Soothe Bell*! Helpful if you want to accelerate the evolution of your Igglybuff, Woobat, etc.

The building to the right is Critical Capture, where you can buy custom balls.

**Critical Capture Shop Right Clerk**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Heavy Ball*   |$300       |
|*Moon Ball*    |$300       |
|*Fast Ball*    |$300       |
|*Love Ball*    |$400       |
|*Nest Ball*    |$500       |
|*Net Ball*     |$500       |
|*Dive Ball*    |$500       |
|*Timer Ball*   |$1000      |
|*Friend Ball*  |$3000      |

Most of these are really not too worth it right now compared to the regular variety (especially Friend Ball... yikes) but I recommend picking up a few Love Balls - their 4x catch rate can be activated 100% of the time given you're trying to catch a non-genderless Pokemon and you have at least 1 male and at least 1 female Pokemon in your party, helpful for Pokemon with lower catch rates we may encounter.

Outside, head right and up. Enter the Pokemon Center, and talk to both the girl on the left and the mother on the right to activate some quests.

Enter the building to the right, and talk to the daycare couple one-by-one over and over until they drop their facade and battle you. Eventually, we will be freeing the real daycare couple! 

In a house to the left, we'll learn about an in-game trade we can't complete just yet. Head outside and to the left, grab a hidden *Steel Gem* in a rock, and go down the stairs to access a new part of the railnet.

**Underground Railnet (Obsidia Area)**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Noibat            |60 |
|Woobat            |20 |
|**Klink**         |20 |

Klink is pretty good on the Factory Field which we'll be seeing a lot in this game.

There is also an *Escape Rope* hidden in the left area.

Head back out and enter the Devon Corp building on the main street.

**Devon Corp Shop**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Repel*        |$400       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

Nothing special here for sale, but if you talk to the mysterious salesman, he'll give you a free *Premier Ball* the first time. 

The next building in line is the Sweet Kiss Candy Shop building. In the top left corner, you can complete a puzzle to get **Swirlix**! The completed puzzle looks like this:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/swirlix.jpg"/>

At the top, a kid really wants some Vanilla Ice Cream. Since he's blocking the machine though we can't get any here - you'll have to wait until it's sunny and buy some from Opal Ward. Give it to this kid and then buy a Vanilla Ice Cream for $1000 from the vending machine - it will be a **Vanillite** in disguise! After this the vending machine will be normal again.

**Sweet Kiss Ice Cream Vending Machine Shop**

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$700       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$1000      |

There is a 1% chance you will actually get a *Blue Moon Ice Cream* whenever you buy any one of these. Choc and Berry are more expensive here than in Opal Ward, so there's really no reason to buy these here ever.

**Sweet Kiss Top Clerk Shop**

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Whipped Dream*    |$1000      |
|*Peppermint*       |$600       |
|*Chewing Gum*      |$800       |
|*Pop Rocks*        |$750       |
|*Salt-Water Taffy* |$850       |
|*Red-Hots*         |$850       |
|*Cotton Candy*     |$5000      |

If you're planning on evolving Swirlix, grab a Whipped Dream. We will eventually need another Whipped Dream for a quest. Cotton Candy functions as a Revive, but is very expensive. The rest are just expensive versions of the status healing items, but all raise friendship.

**Sweet Kiss Bottom Clerk Shop**

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy*     |$150       |
|*Exp. Candy XS*    |$500       |
|*Rare Candy*       |$12000     |

I don't think you need to spend your precious money on Exp. Candy since grinding trainers give them every time you beat them.

Back outside, follow Victoria to the right. If you'd like to get to battle Victoria and potentially get a point with her in a bit, talk to Florinia. 

Two tiles south of the nearby statue you'll find a *PokeSnax*, and another *PokeSnax* is hidden down and to the right, above the upper right part of the rightmost building. Head back to the left and go down towards the South Obsidia Ward! The tile above the bottommost dancing vine contains a hidden *Potion*.

Enter the building here and talk to the guy here. His Lillipup will run off - we will have to chase it. As I did with Teddiursa, I will come back to it once we can access all the locations. For now, exit the building. Two tiles to the right, you'll find a hidden *Dire Hit*. 

Head down from here. Between the first two girders is a hidden *Blue Shard*, and past the trainer in the first box you can find a hidden *Green Shard*. 

While it's windy, you can catch wild **Hoppip** here! Anyways, enter the slums.

## Obsidia Slums

Grab a *Potion* in the trash can to the left and head up. A box in the upper right corner contains a *Great Ball*. Heading down and to the left, the open toolchest next to the nerd contains a *PokeSnax*; the pot to the left contains a *Red Shard*.

To the left you'll find a Light Shard, which heals your party but disappears after. You can always leave it here for a little while until you need it more, if you'd like.

If you talked to Victoria near the park earlier, head up and talk to Victoria for a battle. If you didn't or you want to skip her battle, talk to the fridge in the upper right corner to delete the barrier.

Her Torracat likes to try to set up on you, so be careful of that. Otherwise her team isn't anything too crazy - Ralts and Pichu are pretty weak and you can set up on them.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Victoria in the Slums (+1 Victoria)

After that's done, head down the escalator to the right. There are encounters in this area.

**Obsidia Slums B1F**

|Cave              |%  |

|**Pidove**        |30 |

|**Pancham**       |10 |
|**Yungoos**       |10 |
|**Crabrawler**    |10 |

A long time from now you can trade Pidove away for something much better, so catch one if you like.

There's an *Oran Berry* in this rock, and a *Great Ball* below. You can sneak between the escalators here - pick up a hidden *Max Repel* in a rock and a *Carbos* (read: $4900) in the next room. We can't progress further here, so go back upstairs and go through the door

**Obsidia Slums 1F**

|Cave              |%  |

|Yungoos           |10 |
|**Slakoth**       |10 |

A box to the left contains *Pop Rocks*. Defeat the trainer, hop across, defeat another, and pick up the hidden *Rawst Berry* in a rock up here. Head upstairs.

|Meowth            |10 |

Hop your way to the left, down, pick up a hidden *Potion* in a box here, then go right and pick up the *Moon Stone* here. Anyways, head up the stairs here.

Talk to Corey here, then pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy S* in a jar below. Grab the *Zinc* at the top and head back down.

Make your way to the top right corner of 3F and then head down. In the very bottom right there is a hidden *Ice Heal*.

Head left and emerge onto the roof. There's another Light Shard here - usually they mean either "you're halfway through a dungeon" or "there's a super hard fight coming up". Anyways, follow the path and talk to Mankey in the elevator. Take it to 1F to open a shortcut, then take it to B1F.

**Slums B1F Vending Machine Shop**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Fresh Water*  |$200       |

Sometimes you even get two! Anyways, the jar to the left of the elevator contains a hidden 
*Normal Gem* and the toolchest at the bottom by the youngster contains a *Exp. Candy S*. 

If you talk to this guy, he'll battle you - turns out this is the guy who stole our $1000 Pokemon from the thieves in Peridot! But... he sold it to someone else. To be continued!

Before we enter the big door in here, go left and talk to the second box for hidden *Red-Hots*. In the bottom left corner is a hidden *Green Shard*. You can sneak up and to the left past the elevator, if you do, you can get a hidden *Purple Shard* in the topmost rock.

Enter the gap on the left and pick up the *Friend Ball*. Head back out.

Talk to the box in front of the elevator to watch it scurry away. Enter the elevator and go to 1F. Grab the *Net Ball* and talk to the kid here to make him move. In the elevator again go to 2F to grab *TM60 Quash*. Oh yeah.

Enter the big door back on B1F and head up. Once you see this box move twice, head straight to the right to get a hidden *Oran Berry* in a box. In a trash can at the top of this room you can find a hidden *Poke Ball*. In the next room, it's time for a battle!

**Pokemon Gang. Field: No Field**
- Scraggy, Lv. 15, Ability: Intimidate, IVs: 15
- Scraggy, Lv. 16, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 10
- Scraggy, Lv. 17, Ability: Shed Skin, IVs: 10
- Scrafty, Lv. 20, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 12

As long as you are able to bully Scrafty when it comes out you should be able to make this work with a team of six.

There's a *Potion* in a rock to the left and a *Blue Shard* in the last rock before leaving the room. In the next room, there's a hidden *Potion* in the box on the left and an *Exp. Candy S* in a rock towards the exit. 

Back in the main basement area, go between the escalators to get a *Cotton Candy*. A rock down from here contains a *Burn Heal*. In the room to the right, you can find a hidden *Antidote*, a *Cheri Berry* in the trashcan downstairs as well as a *Super Potion* lying around and an *Exp. Candy S* in the rock below. 

Back upstairs and in the hub, take the escalator to go up. A box on the right contains an *Awakening*. Head to the right and jump your way through this path, pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* and an *Antidote* in rocks on the right side, and go down. Here you'll find an abandoned egg. When it hatches it will be **Bronzor**, **Ducklett**, or **Drowzee**, determined randomly.

Back in the main hub, talk to the backpacker below to get the grate opened for a shortcut, then head back to where Victoria was arguing with the guy earlier and talk to the trashcan to get a *PokeSnax*.

With that, head back to the top right corner and enter the door. Talk to the Spoink hiding under some beams here. Then we can finally emerge into the daylight! There is a hidden ** two spaces right and two spaces down from the bottom-most rock in this area. Enter Coral Ward at the bottom when you are ready.

## Coral Ward

Welcome to Coral Ward. In the right rock as you enter you can get a *Potion*, then an *Ultra Potion* in a rock to the left of the apartments. Heading down from here you can grab a hidden *Purple Shard* one tile down and one tile right of the bottom left warehouse entrance, and a *Chewing Gum* in the box below. There is a *Repel* in the right rock below the singular house. Finally there is an *Aspear Berry* in a rock between the two warehouses on the right.

**Coral Ward**

|Old Rod           |%  |

Inside the apartment complex at the top, you'll meet Danielle who will give you a quiz. Feel free to go find the answers yourself if you'd like. Otherwise, here they are. Whenever you see the following spoiler bar, highlight the text to view the spoiler.

> 4, 7, 31

As a reward for completing the quiz you'll get the *Misty Terrain Readout*. Useful, since Coral Ward is covered in mist.

In a house below, there is an in-game trade. Raise your Patrat to Lv. 20 to get **Watchog**, then trade it for a **Nosepass**.

On the dock, if it is raining and you have Snax, you can obtain **Lotad**.

Talk to the blue haired girl towards the top.

- Nidorino, Lv. 20, Ability: Rivalry, Adamant Nature, IVs: 10
    - Poison Tail
    - Supersonic
    - Fury Attack
    - Peck

This one isn't too crazy. Notice that Popplio's Icy Wind is boosted by the field, so watch out if you were planning on using anything weak to Ice. Nidorino hits somewhat hard but a Steel type can wall it.

After the battle, you'll be given *TMX1 Cut*!

## Obsidia Park

Return to South Obsidia Ward and use your new field move to chop down the tree. Thankfully in this game HMs can be deleted from your Pokemon at will.

Talk to the kid here - we will reunite him with his mother as soon as we can. Enter the Glazamonia Salon here. If we ever get a Furfrou, we can groom it here. They also offer massages for $2000. A lady here will ask us to investigate the Central Salon for them - we will do so later.

Back in Obsidia Ward, we can actually access one more area before we proceed: at the left end of the ward, chop down the tree and go south. Defeating this trainer gives us access to the Obsidia Alleyway.

**Obsidia Alleyway**

|**Koffing**       |22 |
|Yungoos           |20 |
|Poochyena         |13 |

There is a hidden *Potion* in the first rock on top, and a *Green Shard* in the box in the top right.

At the top of the area during the morning and day, you'll find a Litleo, who will run off.

At night, you'll see two Mightyena's bullying **Electrike**, who will join you if you can defeat them.

To the left of the area, a **Minun** or a **Plusle** will pop out and join you if you give it snax. You can get both by exiting and re-entering.

If this is a bit too hard for now feel free to skip this one, but if you enter the Underground Railnet from the Obsidia entrance you'll find Litleo and have to fight a strong Pokemon. 

**Pokemon Mechanightmare. Field: Cave Field**
- Klinklang, Lv. 35, Ability: Clear Body, Modest Nature, IVs: 30
    - Discharge
    - Charge Beam
    - Mirror Shot
    - Autotomize

If you're able to defeat this thing, you'll get **Litleo**!

With all that out of the way, return to the park area and talk to Victoria, Amaria, and Florinia. Head into Obsidia Park. Note that once we are done here we can't re-enter, so if you want the hidden items and such grab them while we're here. All of the Pokemon will be available later, though.

**Obsidia Park**

|Land              |%  |

|**Sunflora**      |5  |
|Slakoth           |5  |
|**Bonsly**        |5  |

Head to the left and grab an *Oran Berry* in the third bush. Grab the *Poke Ball* beyond the first grunt then go right. A bush here will contain a *Chesto Berry*. Cut the wiggly tree and backtrack. Cut another wiggly tree near the entrance and follow the path. After passing the grey street twice the first bush will contain a *Leppa Berry*. Cut this wiggly tree.

Again we are backtracking to go through the middle path to cut a wiggly tree, then through the left path. Following the newly opened area up, grab a *Pecha Berry* in a bush, then head right to cut a wiggly tree to open up a shortcut!

To the right, you can cut another and follow its path to a fight with a grunt. Straight down from here is a hidden *Super Potion*! Follow the path to watch a scene, but a wiggly tree then head back and up at the road. A bush past the road hides a *Green Shard*.

Cut two more wiggly trees. Before we head left, we can actually sneak up past a tree to reach a building: inside, you'll find *TM54 False Swipe* and the *Warehouse Key*. Back outside, follow a path straight to the left to obtain an *X Sp. Def*  

Back down from here, follow the leftward path. In the second rock you'll find an *Antidote*. Use the Light Shard if you'd like, then prepare for a battle!

**Meteor Admin ZEL. Field: Forest Field**
- PULSE Tangrowth C, Lv. 22, Ability: Filter, Calm Nature, IVs: 7
    - Wrap
    - Vine Whip
    - Acid Spray
    - Mega Drain

This is our first battle with a PULSE! For this, and all custom Pokemon forms in this game, I provide a reference for base stats, typing, and other data [in the appendices](#custom-pokemon-form-lookup). The Field Notes app in game also has you covered, minus specific numbers. 

As you can see from its stats (HP/Atk/Def/Spe/SpA/SpD) Tangrowth is pretty slow, which luckily means you can take the chance to cripple it with paralysis or stat debuffs. It doesn't hit ridiculously hard either, so your Pokemon will likely be able to live a few turns before being knocked out, but you do have to be cautious of field-boosted Grass moves. The difficulty lies in its combination of Acid Spray and Mega Drain, as it likes to weaken you then heal back to full. Making sure that you're dealing more damage than it is able to heal will be the key here.

Once you succeed, the vines will recede and we'll be back in the park. A bush to the left contains a hidden *Heart Scale* while sneaking around through the bottom right area of the park will lead you to a rock containing an *Exp. Candy M*.

|                  |   |Sunflora          |5  |                  |   |

Catch a Sentret for an in-game trade, and evolve it by raising it to Lv. 15 to get **Furret**. In the house nearby the Pokemon Center, you can trade it to get **Castform**!

While we're nearby, enter the Pokemon center and talk to the mom inside. Tell her where her son is to get an *Ability Capsule*!

Take another visit to the Central Salon and talk to the people inside. Then return to the Glamazonia Salon and talk to the lady, who'll let you take home **Glameow**. They'll also lower their massage price to $1400. That's not all for this quest though, no. Take your Glameow to the Central Salon and show it to the lady on the right; she'll allow us to battle her.

**Posh Suzy. Field: No Field**
- Tsareena, Lv. 45, Ability: Queen Majesty, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Synthesis
    - Aromatherapy
    - Play Rough
    - Trop Kick

Obviously this is a pretty tough fight for this point in the game, feel free to return to it later. Maybe a fire type might be able to lower its stats or something since it resists both of its attack moves?

If you're able to win, you'll get **Bounsweet**!

Heading north from the park, all the way right from the manhole cover you can find a hidden *Super Potion*. 

The first building here is the Department Store. Head inside, we can buy some things.

**Department Store 1F Left Shop**

|*Paralyze Heal*|$200           |
|*Ice Heal*     |$250           |

We can also talk to an employee to get the *Membership Card* and the *Department Store Sticker: Porygon*. Each time we get a stamp, we can access another floor of the building. We'll be slowly getting these across our adventure.

**Department Store 2F Left Shop**

Our Pokemon have been getting random EV's so far - if you in the future want to EV train your Pokemon, you can buy these to make the process easier. In Reborn, 20 EVs per berry are lowered instead of the canon 10. Don't worry about them for now - EV training will become a lot easier later on.

Outside, head left and grab hidden *Cotton Candy* and *Red Shard* in some rocks. That's pretty much all we can do in Obsidia for now, but before we continue the story we can take a brief detour back to Coral Ward for some goodies.

The warehouse key we got earlier works on three of the warehouses here. In the left one, you'll find the real daycare couple! By freeing them, the daycare will now be in service for all your breeding needs.

The second warehouse contains a *Macho Brace* as well as **Spoink** randomly hiding in one of the boxes. The third warehouse contains a Meteor Grunt. Talking to him allows us to get a Pokemon later on. Also in here is a **Happiny**!

## Onyx Ward

Head up into Onyx Ward from the northeastern corner of Obsidia. Onyx Ward is pretty small, but there are some things we can do here before challenging the gym.

Head up on the right side. Across from the third lamppost on the sidewalk you can find a hidden *Cheri Berry*. Making your way around to the top left corner past the front of the school, the second tile from the left contains a hidden *Antidote*. The rock below contains a *Carbos* and the rock down from here contains a *PokeSnax*. 

Anyways, we can't yet enter the Move Relearner house, so enter the apartment to the right. Talk to the girl on the left twice - for saving the Daycare couple, she'll give us an egg! It will be one of the following, determined randomly: **Clauncher**, **Seel**, **Remoraid**, **Spheal**, **Clamperl**, or **Frillish**. That's all here for now, so head next door to the game corner.

|*Max Revive*   |2 Matches     |
|*Full Restore* |1 Matches     |

We don't have a Coin Case yet, so there's not much to do yet. We can play the lottery once a day though. 

Enter the trainer school at the top left entrance. Fern will lock us out, so head outside and defeat the trainer to enter the school at the top right entrance.

This area is mostly linear with a few detours. Talk to every green bookshelf and stray green book that you find lying around - they'll give us lore as well as the answers to some questions we'll need to answer later on.

In the first door upstairs, a guy will give you the *Coin Case*! The next room contains *Protective Pads*. The room after that contains a *Quick Claw*. Talk to a guy staring at the wall in the hallway from the right to open up a door to the left.

In this door, go to the left. Here you'll find the first tutors.

It's worth noting that every tutor in the game will only charge you once per move - so don't feel bad about deleting a tutor move once you've learned it once since you can go get it back for free.

Head upstairs to grab the *Desert Field Readout*!

Head downstairs from here, head out to the main hall and go downstairs again.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Yes (+1 Hardy)

Enter the door above and to the right and talk to the girl for a *Telluric Seed*. Unlock this gate for a backtrack shortcut.

Head to the left. Defeat these trainers then head into the room on the left. Time for another rival battle.

**Swag Jockey Fern (2x Super Potion). Field: No Field**
- Sandile, Lv. 23, Ability: Moxie, Bashful Nature, IVs: 20
    - Mud-Slap
    - Bite
    - Sand Attack
    - Rage
- Roselia, Lv. 24, Ability: Poison Point, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Leech Seed
    - Stun Spore
    - Mega Drain
    - Poison Sting
- Dartrix, Lv. 25, Ability: Overgrow, Bashful Nature, IVs: 28
    - Pluck
    - Razor Leaf
    - Ominous Wind
    - Nature Power

Fern can be tough to defeat now that his Budew and Rowlet have evolved. Roselia likes to try to tank your attacks and heal back thanks to Leech Seed and Mega Drain, while Dartrix tries to hit hard with its STABs or go for an omniboost. Sandile can sweep with Moxie if you're not careful, so lead with something that can handle it and you should be fine.

Before we continue to the gym, now is a good time to wrap up a couple of quests and areas. 

First, head on over to the Arcade. With our Coin Case, we can now go to town here. Note that by interacting with NPC's and random tiles throughout, you can pick up 1125 Coins for free.

**Onyx Arcade Coin Shop**

|Item       |Price          |
|-----------|---------------|
|50 Coins   |$1000          |
|500 Coins  |$10000         |

Unless you're coming back here really late in the game, don't buy coins. They're way too expensive and by playing Voltorb Flip, you can get them for free. You can also play the slots or the roulette... but these are really slow and Voltorb Flip is 100% the way to go here. The magic number to get all the rewards is 23900 Coins.

Speaking of Voltorb Flip, here are the tips I recommend as a long time Voltorb Flip Player:

1. You can use a calculator to get started with learning what optimal moves are, but in general your coins over time is best served by just playing the game quickly yourself. Even when you lose, it's not too hard to pick back up and try again, even if you get shot all the way down to Level 1. 
2. The game often forces you to make guesses, sometimes 50-50 guesses even. Try to make the guesses that have the least chance of failure first when you find yourself in a no-guarantees situation.
3. Any row (or column, I will call them rows for simplicity) that adds up to 5 can be entirely ignored since there are no 2's and 3's. The only times you should intentionally flip 1's are when you are 100% sure they are not Voltorbs and simply want to make the board have less unflipped tiles.
4. Any rows without Voltorb should be flipped immediately. When there are no such rows... just make your best guess as to where 2's and 3's are in the rows with the least Voltorb probabilities and go from there.
5. It is crucial that you learn what the remaining point values in a row is. For example, in a row with 8/2V, suppose you have flipped one tile and it is a 3. Then in 4 remaining spots, two are Voltorb, so the other two sum to 5. This means one is a 2 and one is a 3, meaning you can try to pick which columns can fit the 2 at that spot and which could fit the 3. Alternatively, in a 5/1V, the minute you see a 2 flipped, you are done, since the rest can then only be 1 or Voltorb.
6. Have fun! It is a bit frustrating when you get to Level 7 and then immediately flip a Voltorb, going all the way back. But the most important thing is fun - remember you can come back later to play and get the rewards.

**Onyx Arcade TM Shop**

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*TM45 Attract*     |1000 Coins |
|*TM42 Facade*      |4000 Coins |
|*TM90 Substitute*  |7000 Coins |

Of these, Substitute is probably the best one, but you can certainly get some mileage out of the other two with the right Pokemon.

**Onyx Arcade Pokemon Shop**

|Pokemon        |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|**Snover**     |600 Coins  |
|**Slugma**     |1000 Coins |
|**Mantyke**    |1800 Coins |
|**Nidoran M**  |3500 Coins |
|**Shinx**      |5000 Coins |

Even if you're not interested in getting everything here, most of these Pokemon are good for the upcoming gym. If the egg we previously got was Remoraid, you can get Mantyke and immediately evolve it which is neat. Nidoran M also can immediately evolve twice with the Moon Stone we got earlier. Snover can generate Snow Warning if you'd like to use that to your advantage.

Back outside, head into the building to the left. Fern's friend will feel bad and let us access the rooftop garden. Up here you'll find *TM63 Embargo*.

**Onyx Ward Rooftop**

|Land              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Bellsprout        |35 |
|**Tranquill**     |25 |
|Pidove            |20 |
|Spearow           |10 |
|Venonat           |10 |

When the weather is clear up here, you can also find a **Pichu** behind a tree if you have snax in your bag.

There is another event we can do, but it only works on certain weekday nights. For now, we have access to three alleyways. You'll need to go to any one of the following: 

- Obsidia Alleyway, on a Monday night
- North Peridot Alleyway, on a Thursday night
- Lower Peridot Alleyway, on a Friday night

Whichever you go to at the right time, you'll find a **Zangoose** digging through the trash that you can catch.

Finally, now is a good time to go finish the search for Lillipup.

After talking to it in the apartment in South Obsidia Ward it will randomly go to one of these five places:

- On the second pier from the top in Coral Ward
- To the left and up from the Central Salon in Obsidia Ward
- Between the Panpour / Pansear area and the Railnet in Opal Ward
- At the very north point of Peridot Ward by the closed gate
- In the northwest corner of Peridot Ward, nearby the apartment containing Snubbull / Stufful

Once you find it, head back to the Onyx Ward. To the left of the Move Relearner house, you'll see the owner with it. You can then obtain **Lillipup**.

## Canopy Badge

With all that out of the way we can head back to the gym. In order to battle Florinia, we're gonna need to answer all the quiz questions. The answers are here, from right to left:

> 1, 367, True, 410, True, 37, 15, True

Head to the left and enter the gym room for a battle.

**Head Instructor Florinia (2x Super Potion). Field: Desert Field**
- Maractus, Lv. 22, Ability: Water Absorb, Quirky Nature, IVs: 1
    - Nature Power
    - Pin Missile
    - Needle Arm
    - Spikes
- Cottonee, Lv. 24, Ability: Prankster, Impish Nature, IVs: 25
    - Leech Seed
    - Poison Powder
    - Nature Power
    - Protect
- Ferroseed, Lv. 22, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Iron Barbs, IVs: 5
    - Leech Seed
    - Nature Power
    - Pin Missile
    - Sandstorm
- Breloom, Lv. 23, Ability: Poison Heal, Bashful Nature, IVs: 1
    - Leech Seed
    - Spore
    - Mach Punch
    - Mega Drain
- Cacnea, Lv. 23, @Big Root, Ability: Sand Veil, Adamant Nature, IVs: 15
    - Sand Attack
    - Pin Missile
    - Leech Seed
    - Nature Power
- Cradily, Lv. 24, Ability: Suction Cups, Careful Nature, IVs: 15
    - Stockpile
    - Smack Down
    - Recover
    - Sandstorm

This is a pretty neat and out of the ordinary team that helps teach the player about the versatility of field effects. In general, the Desert Field actually doesn't really benefit Grass types or most grass type moves. Regardless, Florinia's team is mostly built around using the field successfully. Specifically, Needle Arm, Pin Missile, and Sand Tomb are all boosted by the field, and most of her Pokemon have access to these moves. Cacnea's Sand Veil is always activated here, and Ferroseed's Telluric Seed allows it to gain a bit more bulk and speed in exchange for being trapped by Sand Tomb. Sandstorm lasts for eight turns on the field, and Ferroseed, Cacnea, and Cradily will all be immune to its damage while you may not. Cradily also gets a Special Defense boost from the sand, adding to its already strong bulk with Stockpile and Recover. On top of all that, Nature Power turns into boosted Sand Tomb, and Cottonee has priority on this move due to Prankster!

All that goes to show how even fields that aren't *obviously* beneficial like Electric Terrain for Julia can lead to difficult teams. Aside from Pin Missile Linoone you don't really have many options to abuse the field yourself yet, so the key will be to overwhelming her. Fury Cutter is a pretty great move for this fight - you can get around Ferroseed's Iron Barbs with the Protective Pads we found earlier, and after a few uses the move will tear through Cradily before it can bulk up. Snover is also a good option if you want to cancel out the Sandstorm with a different weather condition, or you could use Castform's Sunny Day to sweep with Fire moves under the 8-turn Desert Field sun. You could also try to run a Flying-type offensive core, which ignores Sand Tomb and can pretty easily deal with everything except Cradily. You might have to think outside the box a little but this fight is fun to figure out, and you can do it.

After winning you'll get the *Canopy Badge* as well as *TM96 Nature Power*. You'll also receive the *PULSE Dex* as well as the *PULSE Readout 5C*. The level cap also shoots up to 35!

# Episode 3: Domino

Exit Florinia's Arena. There are a few things we can do now that we have 2 badges before we continue the story. 

## 2 Badge Quests

First, head to the room containing the nurse in the Trainer School. A girl towards the left side will trade you battle advice for *TM100 Confide*!  

Now that we have 2 badges, the Pokemarts and candy store have updated inventory now:

**Default Shop (2 Badges)**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Super Potion* |$700       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Super Repel*  |$700       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

**Sweet Kiss Bottom Clerk Shop (2 Badges)**

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy*     |$150       |
|*Exp. Candy XS*    |$500       |
|*Exp. Candy S*     |$2000      |
|*Rare Candy*       |$12000     |

Head to Obsidia Park. While it's sunny outside and you have snax in your bag, you can catch a stationary **Petilil**!

Head into the Obsidia Slums. Nearby where we first entered on the first floor, you'll see a doctor talking to a child. Talk to him to get the *Itemfinder*! Note that this is a limited time event, so if you don't want to have to wait until we get four more badges to get the Itemfinder, act now! Since I assume you can use the itemfinder now, going forward in this guide, I will not describe exact locations of hidden items. You'll also find an *Exp. Candy M* here.

Head left and take the elevator down to B1F. Immediately head left and go up, following the path. If you have snax in your bag, you can catch **Makuhita**!

Back in Opal Ward, specifically if you randomly got Clamperl earlier in Onyx Ward, a person near the water at the bottom will give you a *Deepseatooth* or a *Deepseascale*, randomly determined.

Finally, head to the apartment in the top left corner of Peridot Ward. Now that we have two badges we can finally take home **Snubbull** or **Stufful**, randomly determined.

## Jasper Ward & Malchous Forest Park

Leave this house, and head into the Jasper gate to your right. Talk to the guard here and head into Jasper Ward.

**Jasper Ward**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Beedrill**      |25 |
|**Sewaddle**      |24 |
|**Scatterbug**    |20 |
|Pidgey            |20 |
|**Carnivine**     |7  |
|**Pidgeotto**     |4  |

It's worth noting that when we have like 11 more badges we will eventually want a Carnivine for an in-game trade.

Talk to Corey and Heather here, then head into the police station. Talk to the chief here, who will tell you about his missing officers. You don't have to find them, but doing so is the first step to doing the more exclusive postgame story route. If you'd like to play the route of the game that involves not finding the officers in time, you can skip finding one of the officers until you complete up to the end of this section, then find them afterwards to get the quest rewards.

In general, I will mention story splits and how choices affect post-game route availability just so you can keep your options open.

Grab a hidden *Super Potion* outside then enter the building here, then exit through the top. Outside you'll find a Pokemon Center as well as a hidden *Antidote* and *Ether*. During a clear morning or day, you can talk to an **Emolga** to battle and catch it.

Head back down into the building below and exit to the left. Pick up a hidden *Pecha Berry* and continue into the next building. Head outside at the bottom.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Yes (+1 Heather)
- No (-1 Heather)

Head to the left into the Forest Park.

**Malchous Forest Park**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Beedrill          |20 |Beedrill          |30 |Scatterbug        |20 |
|Sewaddle          |20 |Pidgey            |20 |Spinarak          |20 |
|Scatterbug        |20 |**Fomantis**      |10 |Hoothoot          |20 |
|Ledyba            |19 |Scatterbug        |10 |**Paras**         |19 |
|**Fomantis**      |10 |Oddish            |10 |**Fomantis**      |10 |
|Pidgey            |10 |Bellsprout        |10 |**Pansage**       |6  |
|**Pansage**       |1  |**Pansage**       |9  |Carnivine         |5  |
|                  |   |Carnivine         |1  |                  |   |

Head towards the center of the area, and chop the wiggly tree nearby. Following the path that this opens up, you can grab hidden *X Speed, Full Heal,* and *Telluric Seed*. Chop the two wiggly trees nearby and receive a *Super Potion* from Heather.

Double back around to the path on top, defeat a grunt then chop the tree. Down from here you can now head left, so battle a grunt and proceed. 

Down from here you'll find some stairs leading to some grunts - but there is a secret passageway hidden to the left behind a tree. Follow this path to get a hidden *Revive* as well as an egg. When it hatches it will be **Deerling**, **Skiddo**, **Girafarig**, or **Nincada**, randomly determined.

Head back down, defeat the grunts, then go down from here. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and the **PULSE Readout 5B*. 

Head back up, talk to Heather for a heal, then climb the nearby pillar, hop over to the main building, and head in. Jump on down. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and *Exp. Candy M*. Head up for a battle. 

**Meteor Admin Taka (Super Potion). Field: Rocky Field**
- Exeggcute, Lv. 22, Ability: Harvest, IVs: 10
    - Poison Powder
    - Leech Seed
    - Barrage
    - Bullet Seed
- Chatot, Lv. 25, @Wide Lens, Ability: Keen Eye, IVs: 5
    - Sing
    - Nasty Plot
    - Chatter
    - Taunt
- PULSE Tangrowth B, Lv. 24, @Oran Berry, Ability: Arena Trap, Impish Nature, IVs: 31.
    - Leech Seed
    - Vine Whip
    - Sand Tomb
    - Rock Tomb

Taka will fight you on the Rocky Field. We don't have details on this field yet, but you will observe that Rock Tomb will be stronger here. The Telluric Seed can be helpful here: by testing it you'll notice that it raises Defense but does Stealth Rock damage. Since Exeggcute doesn't hit that hard you can take the chance to set up on it and then hit Tangrowth hard. This entire team is weak to Ice, so keep that in mind.

After the battle, you'll be sent outside. Answer Corey how you like here, then grab hidden *X Defend* and *Green Shard* as well as a *Big Root*.

Exit Malchous Forest Park in the top right corner. In the first house, you'll be able to defeat a Meteor Grunt to free Police Officer #1. In the building next door, head up to 5F via the elevator, and talk to the girl inside so she'll leave.

Head back to the main part of Jasper via the bottom right exit of Malchous. On your way back to the Pokemon Center area, you can now grab a hidden *PokeSnax*.

Past the Pokemon Center, enter the first building you see. Talk to the guy here to activate a quest. You can also enter the elevator room here to get the *Forest Field Readout*. 

Outside, you can now grab a *Paralyze Heal* and save Police Officer #2. Grab a hidden *Super Potion* and *Green Shard* outside and head into the small building here. If you have snax and talked to the panicking guy earlier, you can get **Mareep**!

Before we continue into the next ward, there's a quick thing we can do. Exit Jasper Ward to the south (there's a shortcut below the Mareep building) and head to the right. Enter the first house you see in Peridot Ward, and talk to the girls inside for *Department Store Sticker: Tangela* as well as *TM88 Sleep Talk*.

**Department Store 3F Left Shop**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Sticky Barb*  |$600           |
|*Lagging Tail* |$200           |
|*Iron Ball*    |$1000          |
|*Binding Band* |$1700          |
|*Float Stone*  |$400           |
|*Eject Button* |$1800          |
|*Red Card*     |$1800          |
|*Ring Target*  |$200           |
|*Metronome*    |$1500          |

**Department Store 3F Right Shop**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Heat Rock*    |$200           |
|*Icy Rock*     |$200           |
|*Smooth Rock*  |$200           |
|*Damp Rock*    |$200           |
|*Grip Claw*    |$200           |
|*Light Clay*   |$200           |
|*Everstone*    |$200           |

Since money is still tight, I wouldn't recommend binging too many of these items for now, especially since most of them suck. We'll be able to get tons of the weather extending rocks, Iron Ball, and Light Clay after the next badge for free, but if your strategy involves weather or screens they are pretty cheap right now so it might be worth it for those.

Head outside and up to access the next ward.

## Rhodochrine Jungle & The Underroot

Enter the Beryl Ward. We can't really explore much of this ward itself right now. Head to the right to access the Beryl Bridge. Hidden on the bridge you'll find a *Heart Scale*, *X Speed*, and *PokeSnax*. 

While it is windy, at the end of the bridge you can catch **Drifloon**! Talk to the kid here and he will go home.

Back in Beryl, head left.

**West Beryl Ward**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Pansage           |20 |
|Pidgeotto         |20 |
|Spearow           |15 |
|Bellsprout        |14 |
|Scatterbug        |11 |
|Sewaddle          |11 |
|Oddish            |9  |

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and an *X Attack* in the house. Make your way left, grab the hidden *Poke Ball*, and enter the jungle.

**Rhodochrine Jungle**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Sewaddle          |30 |Spearow           |20 |Paras             |24 |
|**Ledian**        |20 |Pansage           |20 |Hoothoot          |20 |
|Spearow           |11 |**Gloom**         |10 |**Ariados**       |20 |
|Scatterbug        |10 |Sewaddle          |10 |**Gloom**         |10 |
|**Dedenne**       |10 |Scatterbug        |10 |Spinarak          |10 |
|Ledyba            |9  |**Dedenne**       |10 |**Tangela**       |9  |
|Pansage           |5  |**Doduo**         |5  |**Pachirisu**     |5  |
|**Pachirisu**     |4  |**Pachirisu**     |5  |**Farfetch'd**    |2  |
|**Farfetch'd**    |1  |**Farfetch'd**    |5  |                  |   |
|                  |   |**Tangela**       |5  |                  |   |

Throughout this guide, whenever we are guaranteed the ability to catch Pokemon that was previously randomly determined such as Pachirisu, I will bold it both times. Catch a Ledian for an in-game trade later, and a Farfetch'd to trade for a fossil later on as well.

Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* here, then head up and get a hidden *Rawst Berry* and *Rare Candy*, being careful to avoid stepping on the suspicious patch of grass. Head down and to the left, you'll see Meteor Grunts. You'll actually have a choice now on how to proceed - you can either step on the suspicious patch of grass or step on tall grass near the grunts to end up in a trap, or carefully sneak around the grunts and head up. 

The jungle is huge, so I explain the results of this choice first, guide both routes to the same location, then explore the jungle after this convergence. 

### Cage Trap Route

If you were trapped in a cage, read on, otherwise, jump to the next section.

You'll wake up in a cage and Fern will taunt you here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reject begging Fern (-1 Fern)
- Beg Fern once, then reject him (Neutral)
- Beg Fern twice, then reject him (+1 Fern)
- Beg Fern three times, then reject him (+2 Fern)
- Beg Fern four times (+5 Fern)

If you do reject him, eventually you will be let out anyways. 

Head up and to the right to free Cain from his cage.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Freed Cain from the cage (+1 Cain)

Head down from here and talk to the lever. Heather will show up and pull the switch to activate these bridges.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Got stuck in a cage (-1 Heather)

Head east from here, and go slightly south once you reach a Meteor Grunt. Continue south until you hit a Gentleman, then go straight east and follow the path up the hill via stairs. The house here is a healing house, should you need it.

### Snuck Around Route

If you managed to carefully sneak around the grunts, read on, otherwise jump to the next section.

Head up and to the right and you'll find Fern. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talked to Fern atop the hill (+1 Fern)

The building to your right is a healing house, should you need it.

### Exploring the Jungle

Now, regardless of your choice you should be in the same place, so I can continue. Itemfind here for an *Exp. Candy S* then head down the hill, pick up hidden *Full Heal* and go down from here. The grunts around the file will be gone now, so you can pick up a hidden *Guard Spec* to the west. 

Head back up and go left. Here you'll see a gentleman, and in this area a hidden *Liechi Berry* and *Great Ball*. Up a hill in the top right part of this valley you can chop a wiggly tree.

Head back down the hill after the scene and go to the left. On this next hill you can obtain a hidden *X Speed*. To the northeast you'll find a hidden *Antidote*. Head back down.

We'll get to the cave entrance at the top later, for now, sneak around the building in the bottom left and pick up a hidden *Dark Gem*. You can actually enter the felled building to the right, inside you'll find *TM77 Psych Up*.

Back outside, head up the ramp to the left and pick up the hidden *Green Shard*. Cross the wooden bridge to the left and head up. Here you can find a hidden *Salac Berry*, *Paralyze Heal*, and an *Antidote* (that you can only get from the left, for some reason). Head back down the stairs but this time follow the narrow path up and to the right. You'll cross a bridge over land here, grab a hidden *Blue Shard* and carefully pick up the *PULSE Readout 5A* without stepping on the shifty 2-by-2 patch of land. After you grab the readout, step on the trap here. This brings us to the Underroot - but we will explore this area fully in a little bit. For now, grab the hidden *Exp. Candy S* in a rock to the right, jump down the ledge and take the stairs here to return to the familiar part of the jungle.

That's it for this branch of the jungle - for now, we're gonna head all the way back to the healing house from earlier. Go straight down from here and follow the path across the bridge. Grab a hidden *Blue Shard* as you make your way left. Head up as soon as you can, here is a Light Shard and a building. Inside, you'll find a PC as well as a in-game trade: your Sunkern for either **Carbink**, **Mime Jr.**, **Cryogonal**, or **Furfrou**, determined randomly. Perhaps more notably, it will be holding the *Exp. Share*!

Head outside and follow the path left. You'll find a hidden *Red Shard*. At the next fork, go up, where you'll find a hidden *Super Potion* and a *Telluric Seed*.

Take the other path of the fork now. You'll find a hidden *Calcium* here. Head to the left across the bridge and pick up an *Exp. Candy M*. Specifically on sunny days, you can battle and catch **Tropius** here as well. It's very strong for this point in the game, so be careful.

Head back across the bridge, and from here go down to find a hidden *Purple Shard* and a *Great Ball*. That pretty much covers the part of the jungle we have been able to access for now, so it's time to explore the Underroot. Nearby you'll see a trap spot on the ground, step on it to fall in.

### Exploring the Underroot

Hidden here is an *Exp. Candy S*. We can't do anything with these glowy rocks for a while, so head out of this area.

**The Underroot**

|Land              |%  |Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Zigzagoon**     |20 |**Barboach**      |70 |
|**Morelull**      |20 |**Chinchou**      |30 |
|Noibat            |10 |
|**Psyduck**       |10 |
|**Kecleon**       |10 |
|**Spinda**        |10 |
|Woobat            |5  |
|**Shuppet**       |5  |
|**Phantump**      |5  |
|**Bunnelby**      |5  |

Head to the right first. You'll find a hidden *Chesto Berry* here. Take the nearby stairs to reach a new area of the jungle. You can find a hidden *Red Shard* and *Exp. Candy S* here. You can also battle and catch **Taillow** at the top.

Back in the Underroot, take the path up from here and cut the wiggly tree. Take the nearby stairs to access another section of jungle. Go up here to find a hidden *Ether* and **Stantler**. 

Follow the path all the way down and to the right. Inside a house here is a lady. She will tutor us a pretty good move... but only if you have a Grass-type starter. Since Grass type starters kinda suck compared to Fire-type and Water-type starters, here's a bit of compensation.

**Rhodochrine Jungle Move Tutor (If you chose a Grass-type Starter)**

|Move       |Price|
|-----------|-----|
|Giga Drain |Free |

Before we leave this section of jungle, there is a broken building with some lights on to the left. Enter this building and defeat a Team Meteor Grunt to free Police Officer #3.

Back in the Underroot go up and grab a hidden *Purple Shard*. To the left you'll find a hidden *Exp. Candy S* and a stationary **Seviper**.

Up and to the right you can get a hidden *Energy Root* and *Red Shard*, and free Police Officer #4. Head down and pass under the waterfall to the right. Head right for a hidden *Dire Hit* and *Poke Ball*. Back left from here, head up. This was an area we visited earlier - you can access the main part of the jungle via these stairs.

Head down from here and take the stairs downward. Hug the left wall as you go down. You'll find a *Potion*, *Blue Shard*, *Energy Powder*, *Heavy Ball*, and an *Elemental Seed* on the ground. Use the Light Shard if you need it and head back up.

At the first fork, now go to the right. Grab a hidden *Oran Berry* and a *Hyper Potion* on the ground. Back up from here, take a right at the next fork 
Go to the right when you can, get a hidden *Ice Heal*, and emerge into the jungle once more.

### Finishing Up in the Jungle

Head out and to the right, and you'll actually pop out in Beryl Ward. There is a hidden *Super Potion* and a *PP Up* here. Head into this library.

You can walk on the tops of bookshelves in here, do so to get *TM20 Safeguard* as well as the *Corrosive Field Readout*. Enter the door on the right. Inside you'll find an *Ill-Fated Doll* and by talking to Growlithe and then the crevasse you find will find out what happened to Police Officer #5. Reading on the job: never again.

Enter the left room of the library if you'd like. Inside you'll meet a man.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Radomus in the library (+1 Radomus)

Back outside, chop the tree to your left and enter the felled building. Beat the grunt and re-enter the jungle to the left. Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy S* and *Burn Heal*. You can talk to Amaria here, the second time she'll heal your party even.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Amaria in the jungle (+1 Amaria)

Cut down the wiggly tree nearby, then head back through the path through Beryl by the library, the jungle, and the underroot to return to the healing house in the eastern side of the jungle. It's time to finish up in this area. 

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to save all five officers by this point.**

Prepare your team as necessary, and head up.

**Meteor Manager Ace of Clubs (Super Potion). Field: Forest Field**
- Zorua, Lv. 25, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Illusion, Serious Nature, IVs: 20
    - Pursuit
    - Grass Knot
    - Feint Attack
    - Taunt
- Baltoy, Lv. 26, Ability: Levitate, Serious Nature, IVs: 20
    - Psybeam
    - Rock Tomb
    - Mud-Slap
    - Grass Knot
- Roselia, Lv. 26, @Enigma Berry, Ability: Leaf Guard, Serious Nature, IVs: 15
    - Giga Drain
    - Extrasensory
    - Natural Gift
    - Leech Seed
- Braixen, Lv. 28, @Sitrus Berry, Ability: Magician, Serious Nature, IVs: 20
    - Psybeam
    - Fire Spin
    - Hypnosis
    - Flame Charge
- PULSE Tangrowth A, Lv. 30, @Pecha Berry, Ability: Stamina Serious Nature, IVs: 10. Stat Spread: 100/70/200/10/70/160. Typing: Grass/Rock
    - Growth
    - Mega Drain
    - Stored Power
    - Rock Tomb

Finally we get to battle Meteor's Ace themselves. I wish there was a way to not spoil the surprise of their first Pokemon in this guide, but that Pokemon and many more on their team have Grass moves that feed off of the terrain's 1.5x boost. Braixen can steal your items and hit pretty hard with Psybeam and Fire Spin, and Roselia as we've seen with Fern is a hard hitting and healing monster in the early game. With the PULSE in the back, this can be a tough fight, especially if you're not careful and let it use double-power Growth and/or let it collect Stamina boosts, since then it bowls you over with Stored Power and Mega Drain.

One thing to consider is that past Braixen a Bug-type can do pretty well here against their team, especially a special attacker or one with Swarm. Cut will also hit for double damage on Roselia and Tangrowth if you so choose. If you're holding a Telluric Seed still, it gives you a free Spiky Shield on its holder's first turn, so in a pinch you can abuse that to set up one of your own Pokemon so that Tangrowth goes down before it can boost too much. Or, you can simply use Slugma or Numel to light the field up and watch their time minus Braixen and Baltoy burn passively each turn.

Once you win, you can find a *Super Repel* in the next area. Head down. Here, you'll see a scene involving Corey.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Find all five officers before fighting Ace (+1 Heather, +1 Anna, +1 Shade)

## Beryl Ward & Beryl Cemetery

With that out of the way, we now can actually explore the main part of Beryl Ward. 

Before we do anything else, talk to the backpacker nearby a dumpster down from the Pokemart. If you give him $5000 he will give you the *Magnetic Lure*, an amazing item that, when equipped by your party leader, guarantees you will encounter a Pokemon you haven't caught yet in an area. No more do you have to aimlessly wander around an area looking for that 4% encounter!

Nearby, on clear days, you'll find another snax vendor. 

**Beryl Ward Snax Shop**

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|*PokeSnax* |$650       |

Enter the building up and to the left from this guy. On a sunny day, go onto the rooftop to be able to obtain **Helioptile** in exchange for some snax.

Inside the Pokemon center, an NPC will tell you a password: *easyhms*. This one was in the readme, but you can input it with a Data Chip if you didn't input it yet and Cut has been too annoying so far.

Around the town, you can find 2 hidden *Blue Shards*, *Escape Rope*, *Fighting Gem*, *Potion*, *Red Shard*, and *HP Up*. Continuing to the left into the cemetery area, you can find hidden *Elemental Seed* and *Poke Ball*.

**North Beryl Ward / Beryl Cemetery**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|

|Bunnelby          |5  |                  |   |                  |   |

|Headbutt          |%  |

|Pineco            |55 |
|Burmy             |35 |
|**Aipom**         |10 |

Next, we're gonna head back through the jungle to get to the library. In the left room you can find a *TwistedSpoon*. Could be useful soon.

Back in the jungle, explore around the area where we fought Ace. You'll find a hidden *Petaya Berry*, *Red Shard* as well as a *Great Ball*.

That about wraps up everything we can do for now, so head into the abandoned gym at the top of the hill in Beryl.

## VS. Agent Borealis

Head into the gym.

### Didn't Save Police Route

If you saved the officers before fighting Ace, skip ahead to the next subsection.

If you want to access Corey's bedroom, you can turn all the pillars red.

Head up and into the battle room.

**Agent Corey (2x Super Potion). Field: Corrosive Field**
- Skrelp, Lv. 26, @Focus Sash, Ability: Adaptability, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Acid

- Skuntank, Lv. 27, Ability: Aftermath, Careful Nature, IVs: 15
    - Pursuit
    - Incinerate

    - Venom Drench
    - Venoshock
    - Air Cutter
    - Roost
  
As you can probably tell from the Corrosive Field notes, you'll be worn down by Poison-type entry damage. Grass types have a really rough time here, and many special Ground moves otherwise super-effective against his team are cancelled out by a Poison type modifier. Thankfully half of his team isn't too dreadful: Skrelp and Nidorina don't hit too hard, and Croagunk isn't too bad if you're able to knock it out before it can ruin you with Sucker Punch. Mareanie hits hard with Merciless and Venoshock both always on, but since you outspeed it you may be able to strike at it first. However Skuntank can hit decently hard by stacking Acid Sprays, and with its bulk it can be a threat. Crobat however is a menace right now, since it basically outspeeds every Pokemon you can have by this point and hits like a truck on this field with activated Venoshock.

The key here is putting yourself in a position to be able to deal with Crobat. It's frail enough to die to one or two well placed super-effective hits, so by either raising your speed or sending in something with some bulk, you may find success. Of course, your own Poison types and Steel types are immune to a lot of the field's shenanigans, hence are good options. Psychic types too are good as long as you can play around Sucker Punch. As long as you aren't going with Mud Shot and Mud Bomb, Ground types can be good at knocking out the fodder to open up Crobat for the rest of your team. You can also try to use the field to your advantage to some extent: Sleep Powder becomes 100% accurate here, and the Telluric Seed gives any Pokemon a free turn of protect. Unfortunately unless you're using your own Poison-type strategies there isn't really much else you can do to exploit this field yourself, so bring a strong team and you can prevail.

### Saved Police Officers Route

If you didn't make this choice, skip ahead to the next section.

Talk to the chief to get the *Corrosive Mist Field Readout*. Defeat the officers milling about.

Turn all of the pillars blue. Each one will also change its neighbors, so keep that in mind while you solve this puzzle.

Talk to the agent in his room, then head up into the arena once you're ready.

**Agent Borealis (Super Potion). Field: Corrosive Mist Field atop Corrosive Field**
- Skrelp, Lv. 26, @Focus Sash, Ability: Adaptability, Modest Nature, IVs: 5
    - Acid
    - Bubble
    - Smokescreen
    - Venom Drench
- Mareanie, Lv. 26, Ability: Merciless, Sassy Nature, IVs: 5
    - Peck
    - Bite
    - Venoshock
    - Protect
- Nidorina, Lv. 27, Ability: Hustle, Impish Nature, IVs: 10
    - Double Kick
    - Venom Drench
    - Bite
    - Disable
- Croagunk, Lv. 27, Ability: Dry Skin, Bashful Nature, IVs: 5
    - Sucker Punch
    - Drain Punch
    - Venoshock
    - Mud Bomb
- Skuntank, Lv. 27, Ability: Aftermath, Careful Nature
    - Pursuit
    - Flamethrower
    - Smokescreen
    - Acid Spray
- Crobat, Lv. 30, Ability: Infiltrator, Timid Nature, IVs: 6
    - Venom Drench
    - Venoshock
    - Air Cutter
    - Nasty Plot

As you can probably tell from the Corrosive Mist Field notes, your non Poison and Steel-types will be Poisoned by the field. Your special flying moves and bubble-based attacks will be nerfed against him as well. Thankfully half of his team isn't too dreadful: Skrelp and Nidorina don't hit too hard, and Croagunk isn't too bad if you're able to knock it out before it can ruin you with Sucker Punch. Mareanie hits hard with Merciless and Venoshock exploiting your team being poisoned, but since you outspeed it you may be able to strike at it first. However Skuntank can hit decently hard by stacking Acid Sprays and hitting with boosted Flamethrower, and with its bulk it can be a threat. Crobat however is a menace right now, since it basically outspeeds every Pokemon you can have by this point and hits like a truck on this field with activated Venoshock, and if you let it boost it's basically over most of the time.

On this field, you really have to find a way to very quickly take out the team without suffering too many casualties yourself and find a way to deal with Crobat, since it likes to revenge kill your Pokemon that have already taken tons of Poison damage and sweep. However, it's frail enough to die to one or two well placed super-effective hits, so keeping a sturdy Rock, Electric, Ice, or Psychic type in the back holding the Atk/SpA boosting Elemental Seed may lead you to success. Of course, your own Poison types and Steel types are immune to a lot of the field's shenanigans, hence are good options. Psychic types too are good as long as you can play around Sucker Punch. I recommend using Fire moves too since they're boosted by the field - only Skrelp and Mareanie resist them and they can hit hard in the right circumstances. A unique thing you can do is exploit the fact that Incinerate, Flame Burst, and Self-Destruct will knock out both active Pokemon and switch you to Corrosive Field (suggestions for that, if needed, are in the previous subsection), so if you are having trouble with Crobat or Skuntank you can send in a full health Slugma or Numel and try to do a kill from the grave.

# Episode 4: Aftershocks

To continue the story, head to Beryl Bridge and watch the scene. After you see an explosion with Fern, our next destination will be the North Obsidia Ward, but there are some very worthwhile quests we can do in the meantime.

## The Mystery Egg and Other Quests

First, after the events at the bridge, enter Corey's gym and enter his bedroom area. Here you'll find the *Silver Ring*, which will help us get some familiar Pokemon! Speaking of which, make your way to the Underroot and head to the bottom right section, then go left and up to reach the large pool in the center. You'll find a **Skrelp** here who will see the Silver Ring and join your team.

Next, head to the Beryl Library. Talk to the Gothitelle here, then pick up trash and stray books all around the library by spamming the action button. Once you finish, talk to Gothitelle for a *Soul Candle*. You can also talk to one of the **Gothita** to obtain it.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Clean up the Library (+1 Adrienn)
  
Head on over to the Beryl Cemetery at night. Talk to one of the pumpkins with a Soul Candle in your bag and you can catch **Pumpkaboo**.

Head down into Jasper Ward and go left. You'll see a kid being bullied by some Venipede and Scolipede. Defeat them, and the kid will head back to his home.

Next, it's time for the big one. Head back to the Jasper Police Station and talk to the chief, then talk to the female **Growlithe**. That alone is a decent reward, but we can take this Growlithe and any male Pokemon in its egg group to the daycare to produce an egg. Bring an egg back to the police station and we can trade it with the guy at the bottom to get what the community calls the Mystery Egg.

The Mystery Egg can actually hatch to be one of 18 different Pokemon - all of which are pretty solid team members in an early-game scenario where a lot of the available Pokemon suck. You'll get one of the following, randomly determined:

- **Azurill**
- **Mareanie**
- **Staryu**
- **Togepi**
- **Sneasel**
- **Shroomish**
- **Gastly**
- **Axew**
- **Vulpix-Alola**
- **Pawniard**
- **Litwick**
- **Trapinch**
- **Cottonee**
- **Vulpix**
- **Elekid**
- **Starly**
- **Rockruff**
- **Larvesta**

Of course, we can get the other 17 at a later time.

## North Obsidia Ward

With that taken care of, we're going back to Opal Ward to head up at the bridge. You'll enter North Obsidia Ward. Defeat some trainers and you'll be able to explore the ward. You'll find hidden *Zinc*, *X Sp. Def*, *Super Potion*, *Ether*, *Common Candy*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Ability Capsule*, *Chewing Gum*, and *Great Ball*.

Finding this last item will put us in front of the nightclub: from 8PM to 4AM you can enter. You can get one of the best TM's in the game here: *TM17 Protect*!

Outside, the building to your right contains a *Telluric Seed*. There's an alleyway outside containing some gang members nearby. 

**North Obsidia Alleyway**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Stunky            |25 |
|Trubbish          |20 |
|Poochyena         |20 |
|Yungoos           |20 |
|**Espurr**        |13 |
|**Mightyena**     |2  |

Don't talk to the guys here quite yet though - we'll be making a choice in a bit involving these guys.

Next, enter the Spyce restaurant below and to the right. A guy inside will give you a *Full Incense*. In a nearby trash can you can find *TM56 Fling*. 

**The Spyce Drink Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Fresh Water*  |$200   |
|*Soda Pop*     |$300   |
|*Lemonade*     |$350   |

Back in the main part of the ward, talk to the people here and in the nearby buildings if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Fern in North Obsidia Ward (+1 Fern)

## Lapis Ward

Head up the stairs to your left to enter the final ward of the city we've yet to explore!

Talk to the girl with the colorful hair in front of the very tall building, then make your way to the very top of the area to talk to the purple haired girl and the guy with red hair. After this conversation we'll be free to explore the area.

Hidden around the ward you can find *Great Ball*, *Blue Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, *Salt-Water Taffy*, *Poke Ball*, *X Defend*, and *Exp. Candy M*.

You can enter the Alleyway towards the middle of the ward, but we won't talk to the guys in here quite yet. 

**Lapis Alleyway**

|Cave                  |%  |
|----------------------|---|
|Stunky                |25 |
|Trubbish              |20 |
|**Rattata-Alola**     |20 |
|**Meowth-Alola**      |20 |
|Espurr                |13 |
|**Raticate-Alola**    |1  |
|**Persian-Alola**     |1  |

Enter the building in the middle of the top row of buildings, just to the left of the gym. The guy inside will teach your starter the pledge moves for some shards.

**Lapis Ward Pledge Move Tutor**

|Move           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|Grass Pledge   |3 Green Shards |
|Fire Pledge    |3 Red Shards   |
|Water Pledge   |3 Blue Shards  |

Enter the flower shop on the left side of the ward. Someone inside will give you the *Wailmer Pail*. In the top left corner, you can complete a puzzle to get **Spritzee**! The completed puzzle looks like this:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/spritzee.jpg"/>

**Sweet Scent Flower Shop Top**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Honey*        |$1000          |
|*Oran Berry*   |$200           |
|*Rose Incense* |$9600          |
|*Floral Charm* |$1500          |
|*Sachet*       |$1000          |
|*PokeSnax*     |$400           |

We will eventually need 2 Floral Charms and around 25-30 Honeys for sidequests later. There is technically a cheaper option to get the honey later on, however. 

**Sweet Scent Flower Shop Middle**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Red Nectar*   |$3000          |
|*Yellow Nectar*|$3000          |
|*Pink Nectar*  |$3000          |
|*Purple Nectar*|$3000          |

If you're planning on switching around your Oricorio a lot, this is the shop for you.

Enter a small house on the left side of the ward and talk to a guy to get *TM21 Frustration*. In the Pokemart to your right, talk to a guy with a hood to get *TM07 Hail*. Next, enter the building to the right. For saving the kid from Scolipede, the mom here will give you the *Department Store Sticker: Drifloon*. 

**Department Store 4F Left Shop**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Air Balloon*  |$400           |
|*White Herb*   |$1000          |
|*Mental Herb*  |$1000          |
|*Power Herb*   |$1000          |
|*Absorb Bulb*  |$1200          |
|*Snowball*     |$1000          |

Some consumables that may be useful in a pinch. We will much later on need a White Herb for a quest.

**Department Store 4F Right Shop**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Smoke Ball*   |$2150          |

|*Power Weight* |$15000         |
|*Power Bracer* |$15000         |
|*Power Belt*   |$15000         |
|*Power Anklet* |$15000         |
|*Power Lens*   |$15000         |
|*Power Band*   |$15000         |
|*TM48 Round*   |$9000          |

Finally some good things for sale in this building. The Power Items raise 32 EV's per defeated Pokemon and cancel out other EV's. Meaning if you catch a new Pokemon you simply have to defeat any 8 Pokemon with a Power Item to max out - or 17 total for a usual 252/252/4 spread. This is so incredibly fast that there is virtually no reason not to EV train in this game given how tough the fights can be. Of course, these are probably a bit too pricey for us right now, but keep in mind that they're here so when we have the cash we can immediately max out our EV's. If you're planning on breeding you can get a Destiny Knot.

Anyways, that's all we can do in Lapis for now, so head back down to the North Obsidia Ward.

## The Grand Stairway

Talk to Cain here, and he will distract an officer so you can slip by. 

**Relationship Point Choices:** 
- Talk to the guard 4 times while Cain is distracting him (-1 Cain)

You can find a hidden *Rock Gem* on the stairs. Head on down the ladder. You can find a *Green Shard* hidden in this first area. Head down the stairs again.

**Grand Stairway B1F**

|Cave              |%  |

|**Sandshrew**     |30 |
|**Graveler**      |21 |

|**Geodude**       |10 |
|**Chingling**     |8  |
|**Dunsparce**     |1  |

We will eventually need both a Chimecho and a Dunsparce for some sidequests, so get them here.

On this floor you'll find a hidden *Ghost Gem*. Head down the ladder. 

**Grand Stairway B2F / B3F East**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Sandshrew         |30 |

|Chingling         |10 |
|**Unown**         |5  |
|Dunsparce         |5  |

Pick up a hidden *Red Shard* and a *Dire Hit* to the right. Below here, you'll notice that there are some ledges we can hop down. If you hop down exactly four times, you can find a hidden *Focus Sash* here. Consider saving this for a situation that you really need it.

Down from here there are essentially four paths we can take down the ledges. I start by heading down the rightmost path first. Pick up a hidden *Guard Spec* then take the ladder. In the next room you can grab a hidden *Star Piece* then head into the small cave here. "The Crystals glimmer with fissures" is a clue related to field effects - see if you can figure it out. 

> The solution: use Magnitude or Bulldoze here on the field. Many of the wild Pokemon have one of these moves.

Once you do so, you can grab the *Crystal Cavern Field Readout*. Head back out then go up the ladder at the top. You can find a hidden *Heart Scale* as well as a *Magical Seed* and a *Exp. Candy M*. Can't do anything else here so head up the next ladder. In here you can pick up an *Ability Capsule* and hidden *Exp. Candy M* and *Red-Hots*. 

You'll notice that we're back on B1F, so head back down the ladder below. This time we are going to take the ledges down to go all the way to the left. You'll reach a ladder. Upstairs, you can find a hidden *Ground Gem* and *Super Repel*. Head down the ledge - again we'll be on B1F.

Head down to the sequence of ledges again. This time we will take the second-path from the left. Use your itemfinder as you're going down and you can obtain a *Green Shard*. Head to the left and go straight up. A guy will give you 3 *Exp. Candy M*. Nearby is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Go down the first set of stairs from here then immediately sneak past some rocks to the left. You'll obtain *TM69 Rock Polish*! Head back down the stairs and climb the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Psychic Gem*, *X Speed*, and *PokeSnax* along the way.

Finally, we can take the huge series of ledges to take the third path from the left. Grab the hidden *X Sp. Atk* then head down the ladder here.

**Grand Stairway B3F Main**

|Cave              |%  |

|Unown             |100|

Talk to the guy in the center here, then head to the left and talk to the two here for a battle.

**Meteor Private Aster and Meteor Private Eclipse (2x Super Potion). Field: Crystal Cavern Field**
- Lunatone, Lv. 30, IVs: 10
    - Rock Polish
    - Psywave
    - Hypnosis

    - Howl
  
Their four rock types have their attacks boosted on the field. They're all pretty fast, especially Midday Lycanroc, so you have to have a bit of bulk to live. With the help of Victoria's fighting type moves though you will probably be able to find a way through this with a team of six.

You can accept Victoria's fast travel request afterwards.

Back in North Obsidia Ward, Victoria will request that you battle her.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say No to Victoria's battle request (-1 Victoria)

**Apprentice Victoria (2x Super Potion). Field: No Field**
- Pancham, Lv. 30, Ability: Scrappy, Adamant Nature, IVs: 10
    - Arm Thrust
    - Work Up
    - Slash

- Torracat, Lv. 33, Ability: Intimidate, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Bite
    - Fire Fang
    - Double Kick
    - Lick

Since last time, Victoria has evolved some of her team, but she shouldn't be too much of a threat if you've been able to defeat all the gym leaders to this point. She has a bit of diversity on her team: Kirlia and Pikachu can hit moderately hard with their STAB Special moves. Torracat will dampen a physical sweeper if you have one. Ultimately you can probably find a way to set up on Pancham or just overwhelm her in a 6v4.

This is technically part of another gauntlet: time for another battle right after, though you do get healed.

**Swag Jockey Fern (2x Super Potion). Field: No Field**
- Rhyhorn, Lv. 30, Ability: Reckless, Brave Nature, IVs: 20
    - Bulldoze

- Roserade, Lv. 33, Ability: Poison Point, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sleep Powder
    - Giga Drain
    - Extrasensory
    - Hidden Power

Since last time, Fern has evolved his Roselia into Roserade, picked up a Rhyhorn, and evolved his Sandile. You don't want to let Krokorok sweep you, but it thankfully isn't too strong until it gets it's first boost, so a good switch can help against it. The big threat here is 31IV Roserade - it's really fast and likes to pickup one-shots with Giga Drain and heal off whatever damage you've managed to get on it. Thankfully Rhyhorn isn't really a threat to most Pokemon, so the key to this fight is figuring out how to put yourself in a position to knock out Roserade before it comes out. 

After winning, you'll be given *TMX7 Rock Smash*. We can't use it in the field yet, however.

Head to the nightclub up and to the right. You'll see a guy outside who you can talk to.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Meet DJ Arclight outside the nightclub (+1 Arclight)

Head back to Lapis Ward and attempt to enter the gym. Time for another rival battle, with a new rival, that is.

Volcanic Cal. Field: No Field / Rainbow Field
- Torkoal, Lv. 30, @Heat Rock, Ability: Drought, Mild Nature, IVs: 5
    - Stealth Rock
    - Fire Spin
    - Nature Power
    - Hidden Power

- Magmortar, Lv. 34, @Oran Berry, Ability: Flame Body, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Mach Punch
    - Belch
    - Feint Attack
    - Fire Punch

I often find that it is raining when I start this fight, hence Drought Torkoal may cause it to be a Rainbow Field battle for eight turns. This makes Nature Power turn into boosted Aurora Beam, interestingly giving Ice-type coverage to a Fire-type Sun team. Anyways, his team is fairly strong for this point under sun, so you're gonna have to be careful of letting his Houndoom and Magmortar destroy you with powered-up Fire moves. The Rainbow field will also increase chances to burn, so your physical attackers may become crippled. One strategy you can use is changing the weather to something else, Rain will dampen his attacks and the other two will cancel the Rainbow Field. If you can knock out Torkoal he has no way to set up Sun, so you can use the Protect and Substitute TMs we now have to stall out the sun if you need to. Weaken his weather and field advantage and you can win.

Head into the gym and go upstairs. Talk to the group here, then head outside and attempt to enter the orphanage in the center of town. A girl will leave. Head in. Inside, you'll have to defeat an Orderly.

After you leave, head back to the gym and go upstairs. We have our next mission: challenging Shelly for a badge. We can talk to Victoria here as well.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria after Shelly tells you to have a battle with her (+1 Cal)

Before we do though we can start a sidequest.

## Joining a Gang

We actually have to join a gang to progress the story. Technically we can do this later, but there are some nice rewards we can get right now, so we might as well start now. You actually get to choose which gang to join: the Magma Gang in the North Obsidia Alleyway, or the Aqua Gang in the Lapis Alleyway. Head over to your choice of alleyway.

### The Magma Gang Route

Skip to the next section if you chose the Aqua Gang.
 
Talk to the guys guarding the North Obsidia alleyway for a battle.

Once you make it in, you'll find *TM46 Thief* as well as a hidden *Red-Hots*. Talk to Maxwell in the back. 

Make your way to the shack to the right of the flower shop in Lapis Ward. Talk to Maxwell here. Then make your way to Ms. Craudberry's house down from the Pokemon Center. Head into the backroom.

Inside, defeat the Aqua associates here. You'll find a *Fire Stone* as well as **Buizel**. Head back to your alleyway after grabbing it and talk to Maxwell here. 

We can now continue our ongoing stolen Pokemon quest as well. Just south of the North Obsidia alleyway you can find a Magma Gang member. He will tell you he already lost the Pokemon to an Aqua Gang member, but will give you a *Metronome*. 

Head over to the Lapis Ward. To the west of the gym you'll find the Aqua Gang member. Defeat him... only to learn he already sold the Pokemon to someone in 7th Street. That's all we can do for now.

### The Aqua Gang Route

Skip to the next section if you chose the Magma Gang.

Talk to the guys guarding the Lapis alleyway for a battle.

Once you make it in, you'll find *TM41 Torment*. Talk to Archer in the back.

Make your way to the shack to the right of the flower shop in Lapis Ward. Talk to Archer here.

Just for completeness, Archer won't be blocking the pond in the alleyway anymore so we can fish here now.

**Lapis Alleyway**

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Barboach          |100|

Anyways, make your way to Ms. Craudberry's house down from the Lapis Pokemon Center. Head into the backroom.

Inside, defeat the Magma associates here. You'll find a *Water Stone* as well as **Ponyta**. Head back to your alleyway after grabbing it and talk to Archer here. 

We can now continue our ongoing stolen Pokemon quest as well. Just south of the North Obsidia alleyway you can find a Magma Gang member. Defeat him, and he will tell you an Aqua Gang member has the Pokemon already.

Head over to the Lapis Ward. To the west of the gym you'll find the Aqua Gang member. You'll learn that he already sold the Pokemon to someone in 7th Street, but he'll give you a *Metronome*. That's all we can do for now.

### Getting the Bicycle and Zorua

Regardless of your gang choice, head over to Madame Craudberry's house once more. Inside, she'll try to get you arrested, but if you have saved all the police officers they'll trust that you are not a gang member. Hehehe.

Head outside and try to leave, and the cop will even give you a *Bike Voucher*!

Enter the building below and trade it away to get the *Bicycle*! Heck yes.

Now that we have our fancy bicycle, we can very quickly get all the way to Beryl Ward... so let's do that. Go onto the rooftop of the building where we once captured Helioptile on a clear night, and you'll see... Corey? Make your way to Peridot Ward next, where you'll encounter him near the Pokemart. Finally, head to North Obsidia Ward and enter the building to the left of the alleyway. Inside you'll find him once more... and be able to catch **Zorua**!

## Cocoon Badge

Now it's time to go for our badge. Head into Shelly's gym and go to the right. There is a front area, a back area, and upstairs - your goal is to turn every single monitor that is in the area on and still successfully get to the upstairs area and cross the bookshelves. You can only cross from the front to the back area if one of the red, blue, and yellow stacks is exactly 1 unit tall. 

Using this information, it can be fun to try to solve this puzzle yourself. The game actually has a cheeky secret way to solve it though:

> Simply check monitors for a light above or below it. If it is yellow, ignore it, if it is green, click that one next.

Whichever way you solve the puzzle, click the final monitor that you can find upstairs, then cross the bookshelves. You can find a *Leaf Stone* nearby.

Head up, and save before you fight Shelly.

- Araquanid, Lv. 31, @Damp Rock, Ability: Water Bubble, Bashful Nature
    - Rain Dance
    - Bubble Beam

    - Ancient Power
- Volbeat, Lv. 35, @Leftovers, Ability: Prankster, Bold Nature, IVs: 31
    - Tail Glow
    - Moonlight
    - Struggle Bug
    - Dazzling Gleam

I think this fight is wonderful because it sweeps the feet out from under new players that think Bug is a terrible type. The Forest Field, as we've seen, powers up Struggle Bug. It also gives Anorith a free Spiky Shield due to its seed. More notable however is the rain that's present here - it prevents you from burning the forest down, activates Anorith's Swift Swim, weakens your Fire-types, and powers the various Water moves she uses. Plus it's the first gym that fights in doubles and the combination of Intimidate and Struggle Bug can make your attacks weak - all this combines to making a difficult fight that your team might not immediately be prepared for. 

To win, you'll have to come up with a solid strategy, luckily at this point in the game you do have some options. Castform's Sunny Day or mystery egg Vulpix's Drought will make it sunny, which turns the field to Rainbow Field. You can then exploit the Rainbow Field by using Nature Power into boosted Aurora Beam and/or 140 flat damage Sonicboom to win. You can also switch up the weather to Hail or Sandstorm, just be careful since her Illumise and Araquanid can switch it back. If you do so you can use specific Fire-type moves to turn the field to Burning which... completely ruins her team. Another generally solid strategy is just abusing the field with your own Bug types - Joltik, Vespiquen, and all of the early-evolving stage 3 bugs can to some extent really shine here. You can use Telluric Seeds if you have them as well. You can also bring your own Swift Swim team to abuse the rain and outspeed her team. Also, Rock Slide. Tons of options here if you think ahead about what your strategy will be.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Shelly on your first try (+1 Victoria)
- Defeat Shelly on a second, third, etc. try (-1 Victoria)

After you succeed, you will get the *Cocoon Badge* as well as *TM76 Struggle Bug* and also get to use Lv. 40 Pokemon and use Rock Smash in the field.

# Episode 5: Escape! from Reborn City

Head outside the gym after watching the scene in Shelly's room. After you head outside, you have another rival battle.

**Pretty Boy Cain (2x Super Potion). Field: No Field**
- Brionne, Lv. 32, @Zoom Lens, Ability: Torrent, Modest Nature, IVs: 15
    - Icy Wind
    - Disarming Voice

    - Flame Wheel
    - Bonemerang

- Grimer-Alola, Lv. 35, Ability: Poison Touch, Brave Nature, IVs: 15
    - Poison Fang
    - Minimize

- Nidoking, Lv. 36, Ability: Sheer Force, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thrash
    - Double Kick
    - Poison Tail
    - Chip Away

This battle probably won't be too tough if you could defeat Shelly. Nidoking hits hard, but it still has fairly weak STAB attacks. Defeat him with your best strategies. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree to save Heather (+1 Cain)
- Refuse to help Heather (-1 Cain)

With that, Cain and Shelly will head over to the Orphanage. 

## Lapis Ward Orphanage

Head into the Orphanage as soon as the door opens. You'll be paired up with either Cain or Shelly depending on who you have more relationship points with at this moment.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat the Orderlies with Cain (+1 Cain)
- Defeat the Orderlies with Shelly (+1 Shelly)

After this fight, you'll be free to explore. Keep in mind though:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Leave the Orphanage while partnered (-1 Cain, -1 Shelly, -1 Charlotte, -1 Noel, -1 Heather)

But you can also gain points:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly while partnered (+1 Shelly)

We can now choose where to go.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Enter the hallway first before exploring upstairs (-1 Shelly)

So, we're gonna head upstairs first. Defeat orderlies as you go up. You'll eventually get locked out from continuing, so head downstairs and talk to Anna again.

Enter the open door on the first floor. Be careful about trying to enter the doors on the left.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- The Player is male and tries to enter the Girls' Bathroom two times (-1 Shelly)

Beat the orderlies in the room above. You can read the green books for some background on the new characters. Back outside, head down and to the left. Defeat more orderlies and pick up a *Data Chip*. Talk to the green computer screen nearby to open a lock. 

Head back upstairs and go through the now-opened path.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Ignore Noel in the cage (-1 Noel)
  
Defeat the orderlies upstairs then open the patient cages. You can find a hidden *Great Ball* here. Grab the *Paralyze Heal* on your way down.

On the first floor enter the room on the right.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Charlotte twice while she's in a cage (-2 Charlotte)

Unlock Charlotte's cage. If you unlock the cage on the right the kid inside will give you 4 *Exp. Candy M*. Defeat some orderlies, then at the bottom grab the *Odd Incense* and the *Archive Key*. 

Back in the left hallway, use the *Archive Key* to grab an *Exp. Candy L* and read some more books about the orphanage's characters. With that, head all the way up to the top of the orphanage to bust out.

**Dr. Sigmund Connal. Field: No Field**
- Electivire, Lv. 38, Ability: Motor Drive, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Volt Switch

- Raichu-Alola, Lv. 36, Ability: Surge Surfer, Modest Nature, IVs: 15
    - Volt Switch
    - Psychic
    - Nuzzle
    - Fake Out

You'll notice that the doctor has a strong team full of Electric and Psychic types. Electivire will often pivot to Musharna, who will use Psychic Terrain, guaranteeing it, Hypno, and Raichu huge bonuses. You can try to use your own Psychic attacks on the terrain against the electric types if you'd like, you can also stall out the Terrain if it is too much to handle. This can be a tough fight but you can find a way through!

Outside, accept Anna's request for fast travel. We'll find ourselves back in the Underground Railnet. Head to the east and smash the rock to progress. 

**Underground Railnet (Middle Area)**

|Cave              |%  |

|**Mawile**        |10 |
|**Skorupi**       |9  |
|**Klang**         |1  |

You can also find a hidden *Pecha Berry*, *Carbos*, *Purple Shard*, *Red Shard*, and *Fire Gem* here. In the bottom right corner you can get the *Dull Key*. Open the gate on the right for a shortcut, then talk to the group at the top. Sounds like we're going to be taking on another gym leader soon, but before that there are tons of areas we can now access thanks to Rock Smash. Oh, and we get to strike at the heart of our enemy gang.

## Defeating the Rival Gang

It's time to help out our friendly gang once more.

### The Magma Gang Route Part 2

If you joined Aqua last chapter, skip ahead to the next section.

Return to Maxwell in North Obsidia, then head over to the Aqua Gang's hideout in Lapis. Defeat the guards at the entrance. Grab *TM41 Torment* while you're here and prepare for a battle.

**Aqua Mastermind Archer (2x Berry Ice Cream). Field: No Field**
- Pelipper, Lv. 41, Ability: Drizzle, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Roost
    - Tailwind
    - Brine
    - Ice Beam
- Blastoise, Lv. 42, Ability: Torrent, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Aqua Tail
    - Bite
    - Skull Bash
    - Yawn
- Sharpedo, Lv. 45, Ability: Speed Boost, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Aqua Jet
    - Crunch
    - Slash
    - Ice Fang

This can be a tough fight since his levels are above your cap and he has Drizzle on his side. That said with no Damp Rock Pelipper is the only rain setter, and only for 5 turns, so you can pretty easily use Protect to make it go away and then go to town. His Sharpedo will outspeed you but doesn't hit incredibly hard, while his Blastoise can be tanky but shouldn't be too threatening outside of the rain.

Once you win, the Aqua Gang will retreat. We can actually now access the pond in the back, nothing new though.

**Lapis Alleyway**

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Barboach          |100|

Anyways, return to Maxwell at your alleyway to get **Houndour**. That's it with the Magma Gang for another few badges, however.

### The Aqua Gang Route Part 2

If you joined Magma last chapter, skip ahead to the next section.

Return to Archer in Lapis, then head over to the Magma Gang's hideout in North Obsidia. Defeat the guards at the entrance. Grab *TM46 Thief* as well as a hidden *Red-Hots* while you're here and prepare for a battle.

**Magma Kingpin Maxwell (2x Berry Ice Cream). Field: No Field**
- Ninetales, Lv. 41, Ability: Drought, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Will-O-Wisp
    - Payback
    - Flamethrower
    - Confuse Ray
- Charizard, Lv. 42, Ability: Solar Power, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Dragon Rage
    - Hidden Power
    - Flame Burst
    - Ancient Power
- Houndoom, Lv. 45, Ability: Flash Fire, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Fire Fang
    - Feint Attack
    - Thunder Fang
    - Return

This can be a tough fight since his levels are above your cap and he has Drought on his side. That said with no Heat Rock Ninetales is the only sun setter, and only for 5 turns, so you can pretty easily use Protect to make it go away and then go to town. His Houndoom is physical so doesn't hit very hard, while his Charizard is really only super threatening under the sun, so you can surely find a way through.

Once you win, the Magma Gang will retreat. Behind where Maxwell was you can get a hidden *X Attack*. 

Anyways, return to Archer at your alleyway to get **Carvanha**. That's it with the Aqua Gang for another few badges, however.

## Rock Smash Exploration

The first place we can go that has new stuff is the Onyx Ward. Inside one of the rooms upstairs the guy playing "Mr. Mimecraft" will now move. Using the Data Chip we found earlier, we can talk to the PC here for a chance to catch **Porygon**. Next, head to the hallway where the tutors are. Go into the left door - inside you can talk to someone who will tell us a new password: *stopitems*. 

As you make your way back through Obsidia, note that the candy store has a new kind of Exp. Candy for sale.

**Sweet Kiss Bottom Clerk Shop (3 Badges)**

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy*     |$150       |
|*Exp. Candy XS*    |$500       |
|*Exp. Candy S*     |$2000      |
|*Exp. Candy M*     |$5000      |
|*Rare Candy*       |$12000     |

In Lapis Ward a lady in the Pokemon Center will tell us about a few more passwords: *leveloffset* and *percentlevel*. 

Make your way to the North Obsidia Ward. Here you'll see a guy selling a single *Link Stone* for $10000. What this does is essentially work as an evolution stone for trade items. It's pricey, but if you have a Pokemon like Graveler you're trying to evolve it's worth picking up.

### Smashin' at the Stairway

Head over to the Grand Stairway and make your way to B1F. At the top right, smash a rock, pick up a hidden *Green Shard*, then go up. In this new room you can find a hidden *PP Up*, *Exp. Candy L*, and a stationary *Exp. Candy M*. Talk to the hiker in here for a *Mining Kit*. 

The Mining Kit allows us to finally deal with all those glowing rocks everywhere. Essentially we get to play the Gen 4 mining minigame except the prizes are actually good. Each stone will generate 2-4 items.

**Mining Probabilities**

We can't revive the fossils or use the Odd Keystone just yet but we will soon enough. The evolution stones can help you evolve your team if you manage to find them, and Heart Scales and Shards will be useful throughout the game. The remaining items are generally good hold items though you can get at least one of each somewhere else in the game as well. There is an incredible number of these throughout the game so feel free to destroy the rocks as you see them. I won't be pointing out when there are rocks in a given room but of course feel free to break them as you see them.

Back in the main part of B1F, head to the left and smash the rock to go down a ladder. You'll find a hidden *Red Shard* as well as a *Rare Candy* and an *Amplified Rock*. Back at the part with the sequence of ledges, take the second path from the left. You'll be able to smash a rock to get an *Exp. Candy M*. Next, head back up and take the rightmost path. Smash some rocks along the path to access a hidden *Exp. Candy M*. Following this path up, you'll find **Solrock** or **Lunatone**, determined randomly. 

### Smashin' at the Slums

Next, we're going to head on over to the Obsidia Slums. On the first floor of the main area of the slums take the top left escalator down to reach B1F. Then go between the escalators through the door here, and use the Dull Key inside. Grab a hidden *Calcium* then enter the next room.

**Slums Playground Entrance Room**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Pancham           |50 |
|Pidove            |24 |
|Mankey            |15 |
|Watchog           |9  |
|**Primeape**      |2  |

Grab the *Super Repel* and enter the next room.

**Slums Playground Main Room**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Pancham           |40 |
|Watchog           |19 |
|Mankey            |15 |
|Pidove            |14 |
|Trubbish          |10 |
|Primeape          |2  |

You can find a *Sun Stone* on the floor. The hidden items in this room are *Purple Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Full Heal*, and *Protein*.

You'll need to defeat the Pangoro around the room and activate the switches beyond them. Once you've defeated the third in the middle, you will get **Scraggy**! Afterwards you can pick up a *Brave Mint*, *Exp. Candy L*, and hidden *Exp. Candy XL* and *Full Restore*.

Exit this area and make your way to the top right corner of the main room in the slums. Go down the escalator then enter the room on the right side. Down the stairs you can smash some rocks and head in to a new area of the Railnet.

**Underground Railnet (Train Tracks Area)**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Noibat            |30 |
|Klink             |25 |
|Geodude           |10 |
|Graveler          |10 |
|Woobat            |10 |
|Mawile            |9  |
|Skorupi           |4  |
|**Drapion**       |1  |
|Klang             |1  |

Pick up the *Light Ball* and hidden 2 *Common Candies* and *Red Shard*. You can smash the dark spot on the way to access another area. Grab the hidden *Hyper Potion*, *Purple Shard*, and *Dusk Ball* as you sneak through this path. Smash the wall on the other side and push the switch here, then go left.

We don't have Flash yet, so this area can be a bit annoying to search for items and such. In the top right corner you can smash a rock to free a guy. You'll find hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *Rock Gem* nearby. There's also a smash wall above you containing an *Ability Capsule*. Make your way down the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Green Shard*. Go down more stairs and go straight up. Inside a smash wall you can find *TMX8 Flash*... but we don't have the badge to use it yet. Darn.

Anyways, back outside you can find 2 hidden *Purple Shards*, an *Elixir*, and a *Dusk Stone*. Inside another smash wall you can find the *Cave Field Readout*. Before you leave this area though, headbutt the tall iron poles here!

**Underground Railnet Poles**

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Aron**          |100|

Head all the way back through the railnet and the slums to escape, then go to the Obsidia Ward Pokemon Center. The guy we saved earlier will give us *Department Store Sticker: Aron*. Very nice.

**Department Store 5F Left Shop**

|Item           |Price          |

|*Great Ball*   |$600           |

The Power Items downstairs may be 50% more expensive than these but you can buy them just once and use them infinitely many times while these are consumable. No reason to ever buy here.

### Smashin' at Beryl Cave

Next, make your way all the way back to Beryl Ward. In the graveyard area we can smash some rocks to reach a new cave.

**Beryl Cave**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Scatterbug        |30 |
|Morelull          |30 |
|Bunnelby          |15 |
|Noibat            |15 |
|**Spewpa**        |4  |
|**Shiinotic**     |4  |
|**Diggersby**     |1  |
|**Vivillon**      |1  |

On the first floor you'll find a hidden *Flying Gem*, *Burn Heal*, *Blue Shard*, and 2 *Ethers*. On the second you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Awakening*, *Great Ball*, and a *Link Stone* in the cage which you'll need to open using a lever in the other. You can also find **Nidorina** in here who will go with you after seeing the Silver Ring. Pick up the *Rock Incense* and continue to the next floor. Here, you'll find hidden *Blue Shard*, *Green Shard*, and *Purple Shard*. Exit at the bottom.

Well, we're back in the Rhodochrine Jungle, in a new area this time. You can find hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Bug Gem*, and *Big Mushroom* here, as well as *TM05 Roar*. 

On windy days, you can have a battle!

**Pokemon Tribe. Field: Forest Field**
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 20, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 30, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 30, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Shiftry, Lv. 55, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Just gotta find a way to hit Shiftry with a Bug move and you'll probably win here. As a reward, you'll get **Nuzleaf** by talking to it.

The totem at the top here also has Pokemon in it. For each Ill-Fated Doll you have (we only have 1) you can fight and catch a Pokemon in the sequence **Baltoy**, **Elgyem**, **Golett**. Which Pokemon this sequence starts at is randomly determined, however. If you make your way all the way back through Beryl Cave to Beryl Ward, then return without an Ill-Fated Doll in your bag on a clear day, you can catch **Natu**. 

### Smashin' at Citrine Mountain

Next, we're going to cross Beryl Bridge and smash the rock here, then enter.

**Citrine Mountain 2F**

|Cave                   |%  |
|-----------------------|---|
|Woobat                 |30 |
|**Bergmite**           |30 |
|Phanpy                 |15 |
|**Cubchoo**            |14 |
|**Sandshrew-Alola**    |5  |
|**Donphan**            |4  |
|**Sandslash-Alola**    |1  |
|**Beartic**            |1  |


Start by going to the right. You'll find a hidden *Ability Capsule* and in the wall you can get **Amaura** as long as you have an Ice Heal.

Next, go down from the top of the area, grab the hidden *Super Potion* to the right then choose to go down at the fork. Go down at the fork after that to talk to **Croagunk** who will join us thanks to the Silver Ring. Grab a hidden *Burn Heal* and return to the first fork.

This time, go up. Along this path you'll find *Blue Shard*, *Shoal Salt*, *Protein*, and *Hyper Potion*. It will fork again. Down the left fork you can find a hidden *Hyper Potion*, *Purple Shard*, and *Shoal Salt* and pick up the *Short-Circuit Field Readout* here. Will be useful soon!

Back up at the fork, go right. You'll find another 2 hidden *Shoal Salts*, *Blue Shard*, and *Max Repel*. Enter the cave entrance up from here, and pick up the hidden *Red Shard* as well as the *Exp. Candy M* and *NeverMeltIce* inside. Talk to Smoochum when you're ready.

**Pokemon Savage. Field: Icy Field**
- Beartic, Lv. 65, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
  - Blizzard
  - Flail
  - Hail
  - Rest

This looks like quite the intimidating battle, but it has default moves. Blizzard will tear you up but it only has 5 PP, so if you can stall those out and get a Ghost type onto the field you're solid. It does like to heal but if you can set up somehow you should be ok. After winning, you'll get **Smoochum**.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Save Smoochum (+2 Blake)

## Omen Badge

That wraps up all the sidequests for now, so enter the power plant on the east side of the Beryl Bridge near Citrine Mt. 

**Yureyu Power Plant (Main Areas)**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Voltorb**       |30 |
|Klink             |30 |
|**Yamask**        |15 |
|**Duskull**       |14 |
|**Togedemaru**    |10 |
|Klang             |1  |

Enter the two rooms on either side and talk to two monitors within to see four total scenes. Return to the entrance room and go up when you're ready for the gym battle.

**Entity Shade (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Short-Circuit Field**
- Gengar, Lv. 35, @Wide Lens, Ability: Cursed Body, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Hypnosis
    - Dream Eater
    - Shadow Ball
    - Thunderbolt
- Dhelmise, Lv. 35, @Lum Berry, Ability: Steelworker, Brave Nature, IVs: 25
    - Brick Break
    - Giga Drain
    - Anchor Shot
    - Shadow Claw
- Rotom, Lv. 37, @Leftovers, Bold Nature, IVs: 25
    - Pain Split
    - Confuse Ray
    - Shadow Ball
    - Discharge
- Banette, Lv. 36, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: Cursed Body, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Shadow Claw
    - Knock Off
    - Dazzling Gleam
    - Destiny Bond
- Doublade, Lv. 37, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: No Guard, Brave Nature, IVs: 31 (0 Speed)
    - Gyro Ball
    - Shadow Claw
    - Brick Break
    - Swords Dance
- Mimikyu, Lv. 38, @Sitrus Berry, Ability: Disguise, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thunderbolt
    - Swords Dance
    - Shadow Claw
    - Play Rough

Finally time to take on the Ghost-type leader. If you check your field notes for Short-Circuit right away you'll probably notice some of the things that make Shade difficult to fight - most of his Ghost-type moves get a boost on this field, but so do the Electric-type moves on half of his team. He also has near full IV's on his entire team for the first time. Gengar is a solid lead that likes to hit really hard or put you to sleep, so you might need to plan ahead with some priority or anti-sleep measures. Doublade and Banette give themselves a bit of bulk with their seeds while Mimikyu's Disguise ability infamously gives it a free turn to get to +2 Attack or revenge kill for free. 

That said, there are a lot of fairly reliable ways to beat the Entity. One lies in the typing: if you can't beat him, join him. Your own Ghost type moves will also be boosted by the field, so something like Unburden Drifblim or your own fast Banette will probably work out well here. There also isn't really anything that effectively can stop a fast Dark type other than Mimikyu, so you can try to overwhelm him with super-effective damage that way as well. The field will also switch to the normal Factory Field when you use certain Electric-type moves, so if you have a strategy using Gear Grind or an Electric-type core you could probably make that work once you get past Rotom. If you've beat all the trainers to this point I'm sure you can find a way to defeat Mr. Smiles.

After you win, you'll get the *Omen Badge* as well as *TM65 Shadow Claw*. Our new cap is Lv. 45 and we can of course use Flash now.

# Episode 6: Poison In Vein

Head out from the Abandoned Power Plant and return to Jasper Ward and attempt to enter Peridot. You'll meet up with Cain here, so follow him into the Police Station. 

Before we continue, there is a pretty awesome Pokemon we can get right now. Head over to the Lapis Alleyway during a windy night. There, you'll find **Murkrow**!

## Blacksteam Factory

Head to the factory on the west side of Peridot. We can talk to the characters here for some points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Cain we can trust Ace (+1 Ace, +1 Amaria, -1 Cain)
- Tell Cain we cannot trust Ace (+1 Cain, -1 Ace)

Talk to Ace and tell them your favorite nature, and they'll give you the respective *Mint*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Get a mint from Ace (+1 Ace)

Talk to Amaria to get on top of the building, and head in. Defeat the grunts, then go down the stairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Amaria you trust her (+1 Amaria)
- Tell Amaria you don't trust her (-1 Amaria)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Ace you think they might be a double double agent (+1 Ace)
- Tell Ace you don't think they could be a double double agent (-1 Ace)

With that, we'll be plunked into a cage with a bunch of Pokemon. Essentially we need to combine Loudred's powers of deafening, Jigglypuff's powers of putting the guard to sleep, and Abra's powers of teleportation to move Pokemon around and attack the cages. In the top left if we saved the day-care couple and talked to the Meteor in Coral Ward, you'll see a Ditto, and we can get some goodies with it.

Wake up Abra with Loudred, then use Abra to teleport Vanillite out of the top left cage. Next, use Abra again to teleport Lickitung to the top left cage. Talk to the top left cage to get a *Rare Candy*! Use Abra again to teleport Makuhita to the top left cage. Talk to that cage to get **Ditto**! 

From here, teleport Vanillite out of the cage nearest the guard - I will call this the "attack" cage. You'll want to then teleport Cyndaquil into the attack cage. The guard will stop us from attacking however. So, talk to Loudred to lose your hearing then to Jigglypuff to put the guard to sleep. Make Cyndaquil attack the bars.

Repeat this process twice more, with Vanillite and Roggenrola in the attack cage, and you'll be able to escape. You can use Loudred to wake up the guard for a battle if you'd like. What's better, you can even teleport the guard into a cage. Nice.

Pick up a hidden *Dire Hit* on this floor, then go down the stairs to the left. In this room you can find a *Magnet Powder*, *Exp. Candy L*, *TM49 Echoed Voice* and the *PULSE Readout 4*. 

Head back upstairs and take the stairs on the right to 1F. Beat the grunts and activate the wall panels. Pick up a *Super Potion* and hidden *Purple Shard* and *Super Repel*. 

Towards the bottom of the area you'll find more stairs, so take these to go up to 2F. Go to the right here and you'll find a machine with some green lights on it. Inside, you can get *Exp. Candy L*. You can also find a *Thunderstone* and a hidden *Revive*. Activate the panel at the top and go back down. To the left, you'll see an open door. Get ready for battle.

**Meteor Admin ZEL (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Factory Field**
- Glaceon, Lv. 37, @Never-Melt Ice, Ability: Ice Body, Hardy Nature, IVs: 31
    - Ice Shard
    - Icy Wind
    - Mirror Coat
    - Bite
- Espeon, Lv. 37, @Twisted Spoon, Ability: Magic Bounce, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Morning Sun
    - Psychic
    - Signal Beam
    - Yawn
- Umbreon, Lv. 37, @Lum Berry, Ability: Synchronize, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Moonlight
    - Assurance
    - Quick Attack
    - Confuse Ray
- PULSE Muk, Lv. 42, @Leftovers, Ability: Protean, Modest Nature, IVs: 31. 
    - Sludge Wave
    - Mud Bomb
    - Muddy Water
    - Discharge

This time ZEL comes at us with both a PULSE and three Eeveelutions. The first three members of the team aren't particularly awful - something with a bit of physical bulk and some healing can take Umbreon and a fast physical attacker or two can deal with Glaceon and Espeon.

Of course, the PULSE can be difficult to deal with. It has a bit more speed than Tangrowth, but still not enough that you won't be able to outspeed it with most Pokemon. It's Protean ability gives it STAB on field boosted Discharge and Muddy Water and makes it a bit hard to plan your offense since it changes types. While its 97 Sp. Atk isn't monumental, with 105 HP, 250 Special Defense, and Leftovers, you won't really be able to do anything to it with special moves. Knock Off is a good idea here to prevent it's recovery, or you can opt to hit really hard with two or three physical attackers that are able to capitalize on Protean with moves super effective against Poison / Ground / Water / Electric depending on what it's used last. 

Once you win, you'll get the *Harbor Key*. 

## Apophyll Beach

Make your way to the Coral Ward and enter the only remaining locked warehouse. Inside, you can take the boat to Apophyll Beach!

As soon as you enter, go straight left and weave between the hills to get a *Wave Incense*.

**Apophyll Beach**

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |Old Rod           |%  |

|                  |   |**Binacle**       |5  |                  |   |

You can also catch **Pyukumuku** chilling all around the beach.

Hidden along this part of the beach you can find a *Green Shard*, 4 *Shoal Shells*, 2 *Red Shards*, *Hyper Potion*, 2 *Stardusts*, 2 *PokeSnax*, *Common Candy*, *Full Heal*, *Blue Shard*. 

You'll enter the Apophyll Academy map by going to the left at the top. Go all the way around the academy sticking to this map: hidden here are *Super Potion*, *Shoal Shell*,  *Blue Shard*, *Full Heal*, and *Soft Sand*. Back down at the academy's front entrance, go down from here. You'll find hidden *Red Shard*, *Hyper Potion*, *Great Ball*, *Red-Hots*.

**Apophyll Academy / Apophyll Beach West**

|Rock Smash        |%  |Old Rod           |%  |

|Binacle           |1  |                  |   |

Before we continue the story, head to the left side of the academy to reach a new section of beach. Across the wide band from the Pyrous Mountain entrance at the bottom to the Apophyll Cave entrance at the top, you'll find hidden *Swift Wing*, *Green Shard*, *Star Piece*, *Telluric Seed*, 3 *Shoal Shells*, 2 *Stardusts*, 2 *Purple Shards*, *Exp. Candy L*, *X Sp. Def*, and *Red Shard*. 

If it is storming, you can find a **Corsola** on the left side of the area who will join you in exchange for snax.

Head back to the Apophyll Academy. Now, we're going to head inside.

|*Super Repel*  |$700       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

Head up to reach the middle part of the area. Fight some trainers and pick up a hidden *Guard Spec.* Now we are going to enter the six doors in this area: the top left has a *Black Belt*, the girl in the bottom left wants us to steal a TV for her (in a bit), the Dudebro in the top right wants Protein in exchange for his *Ashen Beach Field Readout*, the guy in the middle right will give us *Pure Incense*, the bottom right room contains a person who will tell us about the *unrealtime* password and a person who judges Hidden Power types. 

Enter the area at the top, then go up the stairs. Talk to every NPC here and agree to study with those who ask. One is a tutor.

|Pain Split |3 Red Shards   |

Head out the door to the right, then go down. In the next room talk to the NPCs again and study with them. Head out the door to the right and talk to the girl on the path to get **Meditite**. 

Relationship Point Chocies:
- Obtain Meditite (+1 Victoria)

Back down from here, attempt to steal the TV. Once you win, return to the girl who requested it to get *Department Store Sticker: Meditite*.

The type berries are all pretty useful when you need them, but I would recommend only stocking up when you know you need some because of the price.

Anyways, back in Apophyll we are next going to explore the optional area Apophyll Cave at the very top of the beach.

## Apophyll Cave

**Apophyll Cave 1F**

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |

|**Stunfisk**      |7  |                  |   |

We will eventually be able to trade Stunfisk later on, so get one if you can.

In item balls you can find the *Oval Charm*, and *Dragon Memory*. Hidden on the first floor is a *Heat Rock*, *Blue Shard*, *Super Potion*, and *Exp. Candy M*.

The NPC in the top right will do an in-game trade: your Ledian for his **Shieldon**.

**Apophyll Cave 2F**

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Crabrawler        |25 |Geodude           |60 |

|**Crustle**       |1  |                  |   |

On the second floor you can find in item balls *Exp. Candy L*, *Water Stone*, and *Zoom Lens*, while hidden items include *Red Shard*, *Ether*, *Potion*, *Paralyze Heal*, and *Burn Heal*.

## Pyrous Mountain

Now we can continue with the story. Head into the meditation area to the south of the academy and talk to the pink haired lady.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Kiki you are a new student (+1 Cal, +1 Victoria)

Head into the back room of the academy and talk to Kiki again. She will tell us that we have to battle Victoria or we have to battle Cal. We actually can do both of them, so I will cover both fights. If you feel like skipping one of them, you can.

To fight Victoria, head into the courtyard of the academy.

**Apprentice Victoria (2x Choc Ice Cream). Field: Ashen Beach**
- Pangoro, Lv. 38, @Shell Bell, Ability: Iron Fist, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Bullet Punch
    - Payback
    - Strength
    - Circle Throw
- Mienfoo, Lv. 38, @Muscle Band, Ability: Regenerator, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Drain Punch
    - Fake Out
    - Meditate
    - Rock Tomb
- Raichu-Alola, Lv. 39, Ability: Surge Surfer, IVs: 30
    - Hidden Power
    - Nasty Plot
    - Psychic
    - Thunderbolt
- Gallade, Lv. 40, @Shell Bell, Ability: Justified, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Leaf Blade
    - Night Slash
    - Psycho Cut
    - Swords Dance
- Incineroar, Lv. 41, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Intimidate, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Strength
    - Darkest Lariat
    - Iron Head
    - Fire Fang

Victoria is starting to really beef up her team but still isn't incredibly tough. She picked up a Mienfoo and finally evolved her other four team members, so they can actually deal damage now. You'll notice from the field notes that Strength and Meditate are boosted on this field, so watch out for those. With good coverage and/or exploiting the field you can win this battle!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Victoria at Apophyll Academy (+1 Victoria)

Now I will tackle climbing Pyrous Mountain. We aren't required to go up here yet as you only need to fight one of them, but we will need to climb it eventually. It is located at the bottom left corner of Apophyll Beach.

**Pyrous Mountain B1F / 1F / 2F / 3F**

|Cave                   |%  |
|-----------------------|---|
|Numel                  |25 |
|**Diglett-Alola**      |20 |
|Noibat                 |14 |
|Slugma                 |10 |
|**Sawk**               |10 |
|**Throh**              |10 |
|Graveler               |6  |
|**Dugtrio-Alola**      |4  |
|**Magcargo**           |1  |

You can also find Magcargo by smashing the nearby pillars. Anyways, nothing to do on 1F so go to B1F via the ladder. You'll see a pillar glowing, which means we can drain lava by rock smashing it. Do so, then go down the ladder to the left to B2F.

**Pyrous Mountain B2F**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Slugma            |50 |
|Numel             |50 |

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and drain the lava. Head up the ladder and immediately come back down. If it is still glowing, you can smash the pillar to get **Turtonator**. This is one of two possibilities of a randomly determined event.

Back on B1F, you'll see that the lava has drained, so go into the empty pool and go down. Head down the ladder here, and you'll find a hidden *Charcoal*. If you didn't get Turtonator earlier, there will be a **Heatmor** here to catch. Back upstairs, jump down the hole in the pool to get a *Flame Orb* as well as the *Super-Heated Field Readout*.

Head back to 1F, where the lava will now be drained as well. Follow the path up to 3F. A lava pool will force you to the left back to 2F, where you can drain the lava. Take the ladder to 1F then head to the left to drain it again. Finally, return to B1F then B2F to finish draining the lava as we did before. 

Make your way back to 3F, then go across the empty pool. On 4F you can find a hidden *X Defend* before exiting to the peak. The peak hides a *Exp. Candy L*.

**Igneous Cal (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Super-Heated Field**
- Barbaracle, Lv. 38, Ability: Tough Claws, Brave Nature, IVs: 20
    - Stealth Rock
    - Slash
    - Scald
    - Rock Slide
- Turtonator, Lv. 38, Ability: Shell Armor, Bashful Nature, IVs: 20
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Flamethrower
    - Head Smash
    - Revenge
- Hakamo-o, Lv. 39, Ability: Soundproof, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sky Uppercut
    - Dual Chop
    - Headbutt
    - Rock Tomb

    - Thunder Punch
    - Fire Punch

    - Wing Attack
- Magmortar, Lv. 41, Ability: Flame Body, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Focus Blast
    - Thunderbolt
    - Solar Beam
    - Lava Plume

Cal now has a full team of six and of course gets the full benefit of the field. It boosts Scald as well as the Fire moves, and can turn into the Burning Field if Magmortar gets to use Lava Plume. Aside from Scald your own Water types will have a tougher time on this field. Luckily, he still makes some suboptimal moves - his Typhlosion hits hardest with Solar Beam and his Charizard is physical, for example. Past Hakamo-o a Rock type or two can pretty much destroy his whole team. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Cal atop Pyrous Mountain (+2 Cal)

Return to Kiki's room once you're done with your chosen battle(s) and talk to them inside.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Victoria you cannot keep a secret (-1 Victoria)

## VS. The Sensei

To finish off this section, we have to battle Kiki in the main courtyard. Prepare your team because this is a toughie. Make sure to save before, just in case.

**Sensei Kiki (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Ashen Beach**
- Machamp, Lv. 40, @Leftovers, Ability: No Guard, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Strength
    - Meditate

    - Aura Sphere
    - Psychic

    - Hidden Power
- Medicham, Lv. 43, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Pure Power, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Drain Punch
    - Meditate
    - Strength
    - Ice Punch

Man this fight kicks my butt on at least half of my replays. Ashen Beach field has so many little things that help her team of six fully evolved Fighting types that you really have to be on your toes to survive this battle. Her lead either will go straight for a field boosted Strength if your lead is weak or will set up +3 Attack on the first turn, so it is hard to immediately get momentum. In the back is Toxicroak who loves setting up and punishing you with Sucker Punch, Hitmonlee, who will outspeed the whole world thanks to Unburden, Gallade who... is just OK honestly, Lucario who is the sole special attacker and loves to get a double boost with field-boosted Calm Mind, and Medicham, who hits like a truck. Medicham and Lucario also ignore accuracy and evasion!

This field can't be changed naturally, so you can try your best to work within it. One obvious answer within is that Psychic, Zen Headbutt, and Calm Mind get boosts here, so if you can get around Hitmonlee and Toxicroak's priority/speedy dark moves you can sweep that way somehow. Stoutland and Sandslash's Sand Rush is always on and could help with certain strategies. The Sand and Mud moves also get boosted here as do Muddy Water and Surf, so if you need extra damage you may consider those. Otherwise, it's really all just about maintaining some kind of momentum. If you're able to bait out Toxicroak's 5 Sucker Punches very carefully you can set up on it for example. Your own uses of Nature Power into Meditate can turn many physical attackers into potential sweepers, so that's something to consider. This one is hard for me everytime but I always eventually figure it out, so can you!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Kiki on your first try (+1 Victoria)
- Defeat Kiki on the second, third, etc. try (-2 Victoria)

# Episode 7: Poison In Vain

Take the yacht to Azurine Island.

|                  |   |**Exeggcute**     |15 |

With that, we can start to explore this island. Note that many item balls are Foongus in disguise.

The first island has a *Potion* and hidden *Pretty Wing*. The next area contains a *Great Ball* and hidden *Hyper Potion*. Before cutting the tree go to the left to get 
a hidden *Red Shard* and *TM83 Infestation*. 

Cut the tree and go right. Before going down the ledge you can get an *Antidote* as well as hidden *Ice Gem*, *Resist Wing* and 2 *TinyMushrooms*. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* below.

On the next island to the right, you can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Tiny Mushroom*,*Red Shard*, and *Synthetic Seed*. Following the path behind the Foongus in the bottom left you can get a *Shiny Stone*.

Back up from here, cross to the right. You can find a hidden *Green Shard* on this island. At the top left there is a path across the water that will lead to a hidden *Thunderstone*. 

Head down the ledge on the east island. You can find a hidden *Swift Wing* here and follow the ivy up from here to get the *Swamp Field Readout*. Briefly stopping on the middle island, head down using the ivy to pick up a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* then head left.

You can head down as soon as you touch land to get a *Miracle Seed*. Back on land, you'll find a hidden *Great Ball* and *Guard Spec.* Use the Light Shard and head left. Before continuing left to the next island, you can go down via the ivy to find one hidden *Dusk Ball* and one non-hidden *Dusk Ball*. Head up and left when you're ready.

    - Crush Claw
  
Another battle with Aster and Eclipse, this time featuring a full team, however this one shouldn't usually be too bad. Deal with Solrock and Lunatone as you usually do, then you'll have the other four. The Lycanrocs and Passimian are speedy and hit hard, but after a few turns they'll all become slowed down by the field, allowing you to capitalize on their low bulk. Oranguru likes to use Instruct and/or hit both of your Pokemon with Nature Power into field-boosted Muddy Water, so be careful of that, but you should be able to take it down otherwise without too much trouble.

Left from here you'll grab a hidden *Potion*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Ether*, and *Escape Rope*. Cut the tree up from here to get another hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Go down from here. You'll find a *Magical Seed* and hidden *Purple Shard*. Head down and right to grab a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* and a hidden *Green Shard* a bit further... and we can finally enter the building here. 

Pick up the *PULSE Readout 6* and talk to the machine in the top to reveal a secret passageway. Heal or switch up your team and go up.

**Meteor Admin Taka (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Factory Field**

    - Roost

Time to fight Taka again. Although he has added Klefki and Gligar to his team, neither should be too threatening. Just be careful of Exeggutor hitting hard with its STABs and Nature Power into Gear Grind and also Chatot setting up on you.

Accept Cain's fast travel request. 

## The Battle for Apophyll

Once you're back on Apophyll, prepare your team. It's worth pointing out that in the battle winning is optional, but there are strategies to win if you're interested. Head down to Pyrous Mountain.

Head in and you'll be partnered up with Victoria.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Try to leave Pyrous while partnered with Victoria (-2 Victoria)

Anyways, if you haven't explored Pyrous yet now you'll have to, so follow the directions in the above Pyrous section if you'd like. If you have, you just have to make it back up to the peak using the straightforward path, beating grunts as you go.

Once you reach the peak, it's time for that battle I was talking about. 

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to win this battle.**

**Meteor Leader Solaris (2x Full Heal). Field: Super-Heated Field**
- Garchomp, Lv. 75, @Leftovers, Ability: Rough Skin, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Dragon Rush
    - Earthquake
    - Fire Fang
    - Stone Edge

This is an "impossible battle" in the normal sense that the story will progress if you lose, but it actually does acknowledge your success with being a precondition for one of the postgame routes as well as some points. For that reason I will hide the text on my recommendations.

> You won't have an easy time with status conditions thanks to the Full Heals. There are still numerous things you can do here. The Focus Sash is always an option - putting it on a Counter Pokemon or something with attack-lowering moves can open it up to not kill some of your Pokemon. For an easier time, Bastiodon and Sudowoodo both get Sturdy and Metal Burst / Counter, Sharpedo can Speed Boost and use Destiny Bond, Murkrow can use Prankster Perish Song... the possibilities for this fight are vast.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Cain, +1 Victoria, +1 Cal, +1 Shade, +1 Anna, +3 Taka)

## Byxbysion Wasteland

After the scenes on top of Pyrous, head back to Reborn City and go to the South Obsidia Ward. Talk to Cain to enter the Byxbysion Wasteland.

**Byxbysion Wasteland**

|Graveler          |5  |**Inkay**         |10 |

In this first area you can find 2 hidden *Blue Shards*, *Green Shard*, *Potion*, *Telluric Seed*, and *Poison Gem*. Follow the ledge at the bottom and pick up a hidden *Full Heal* and *Red Shard*. A nearby slide will take you to a hidden *Green Shard* and *Escape Rope*. Read the grave while you're here to initiate a quest.

Enter the building and emerge at the top. On this upper platform you can find a hidden *Green Shard*. First, we will be going up, so take the ledge up in the top left corner. You'll find hidden *Genius Wing*, *Ability Capsule*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, and *Carbos*. In the top right side there is a canister you can talk to that will turn red - we will need to do this to multiple canisters across the wasteland to access a secret area. In the top left corner of this area you can enter a cave. Following it to the left and out you can get a hidden *Cotton Candy*. Head back and down the ledge, making your way back through the building with stairs to emerge at the top.

Take the slide to the right now. You can find hidden *X Defend*, *X Speed*, *Hyper Potion*, *Exp. Candy L*, *Poke Ball*, *Purple Shard*, *Green Shard*, *Poison Barb*, *Purple Shard*, and *Protein*. Up from here you can find another canister to turn red. Up and to the left you can go through a building to find a hidden *Black Sludge*. Head to the bottom left of this segment. Hop down one ledge. Here you'll find another canister to turn red, the *Wasteland Field Readout* hiding behind a rock as well as hidden *Blue Shard* and *Peppermint*. From here you'll have to go back through the building and down the slide to return to this area.

In the bottom right section, use the Light Shard and talk to Ace for a battle.

Ace has a full team but it isn't particularly bolstered by the field. Be careful not to let Honchkrow or Clefable sweep you and I'm sure you can find a way through this fight.

Talk to the screen beyond them to unlock a door down and to the right. Exit the building at the top and go down the first slide. You'll find a *Lax Incense* up here. Go down the slide to the left. You'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Heart Scale*, and *Calcium*, as well as another canister to turn red. Down the ledge you'll need to go through the building again, this time go right. Grab the hidden *Potion*. 

In the top right corner of the area, you can find hidden *Ground Gem*, *Purple Shard*, *Ether*, and *Ice Heal*. Talk to the final canister to turn red.

Talk to Cain if you'd like then enter the building. Heal and prepare your team, save, then enter the room on the left.

    - Leaf Blade
    - Swords Dance
    - Sucker Punch
    - Spirit Shackle

Fern is back with a full team. His general strategies remain the same: Krookodile will try to sweep, Roserade will hit hard and fast with Giga Drain to heal itself, and Decidueye will try to Sucker Punch you and/or sweep with Swords Dance. Scyther hits fairly hard with its STABs, especially Technician Wing Attack. Fraxure and Rhydon aren't as bad but you still have to be careful. 

Past the Ground types, a Poison type can abuse the field to sweep the field. Nature Power turns into Gunk Shot and, as an added bonus, is immune to Sucker Punch. Once you can get past Roserade he doesn't have an incredible amount of speed so a boosted sweeper can probably succeed here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Fern on the first try (+1 Aya, +1 Hardy)

After you win, we are able to proceed to a gym battle, but opening up the canisters actually opened up a second half of the wasteland we can explore for some goodies, so we'll go ahead and do that now. This is optional.

## Byxbysion Tunnels

Head down from the wasteland hideout, smash the rock and go down the ledge. You'll see that the left building door is now open. 

**Hidden Tunnel / Byxbysion Grotto / Byxbysion Tunnels 1**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Zubat             |30 |
|Trubbish          |20 |
|**Solosis**       |20 |
|Koffing           |10 |
|Onix              |10 |
|Mawile            |6  |
|Golbat            |4  |

The tunnel is straightforward - enter the cave entrance at the end to reach another tunnel.

**Byxbysion Tunnels 2**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Trubbish          |20 |
|Zubat             |20 |
|Nidoran M.        |15 |
|**Nidoran F.**    |15 |
|Solosis           |10 |
|Koffing           |10 |
|Nidorina          |5  |
|**Nidorino**      |5  |

Emerge on the other side and go down the slide. Grab a hidden *Synthetic Seed* and go down the next slide. Here a guy will tell you about the password *nodamageroll*. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and enter the next cave. Follow the path through to the outside. The next area will have a hidden *Sticky Barb* and *Full Heal*, and a *Poison Barb* to the right. Enter the next cave entrance. 

Interact with both canisters to make the bookshelf in the back get moved over. Inside the next room you can find a hidden *Sun Stone*. 

Inside the room to the left, you can use an Odd Keystone if you've found one via mining to get **Spiritomb**. The second room contains *TM66 Payback*. Prepare yourself and enter the third room.

**Pokemon Horde. Field: Wasteland Field**
- Trubbish, Lv. 30, Ability: Aftermath, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Toxic Spikes
    - Sludge Bomb
    - Self-Destruct
    - Acid Spray
- Trubbish, Lv. 30, Ability: Aftermath, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Toxic Spikes
    - Sludge Bomb
    - Self-Destruct
    - Acid Spray
- Mr. Bigglesworth (PULSE Garbodor), Lv. 65, @Black Sludge, Ability: Stench, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/4/0/0/0
    - Gunk Shot
    - Pain Split
    - Stockpile
    - Drain Punch

Mr. Bigglesworth is tough and also our first opponent that is EV trained. You can set up while the Trubbish are out with your own Steel or Poison type then destroy him. Sad :(

Behind you'll find *TM09 Venoshock* as well as the *PULSE Readout 0*. 

That's it for this part, so return to the room with the two canisters. Hidden behind the left one is another tunnel. As you follow the path you can get a hidden *Focus Sash*. Nice.

Once you appear outside, go down the slide here and grab a hidden *Moon Stone*. Go in the cave and head up the ladder, then go right back down to reach a new area. Sadly the mining rock here is all we can get right now, so head up the ladder and go down the slide then make your way back to the Wasteland hideout.

## Blight Badge

Enter the gym room, save, and talk to Aya.

**Wasteland Punk Aya (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Wasteland Field**
- Nidoqueen, Lv. 41, @Black Sludge, Ability: Poison Point, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sludge Wave
    - Stealth Rock
    - Crunch
    - Stomp Tantrum
- Toxapex, Lv. 41, @Black Sludge, Ability: Merciless, Calm Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sludge Wave
    - Recover
    - Icy Wind
    - Toxic Spikes
- Venusaur, Lv. 42, Ability: Overgrow, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Stomp Tantrum
    - Power Whip
    - Nature Power
    - Leech Seed
- Drapion, Lv. 42, @Muscle Band, Ability: Battle Armor, Careful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Knock Off
    - Fire Fang
    - Cross Poison
    - Aqua Tail
- Salazzle, Lv. 42, @Focus Sash, Ability: Corrosion, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Nasty Plot
    - Heat Wave
    - Sludge Wave
    - Disable
- Dragalge, Lv. 45, @Black Sludge, Ability: Adaptability, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sludge Wave
    - Shadow Ball
    - Hydro Pump
    - Dragon Pulse

Aya is another difficult doubles gym leader. The field boosts her Sludge Waves and Venusaur's Power Whip for one. Entry Hazards are all turned into end-of-turn effects - Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rocks will do damage and the former will Poison your Pokemon. With the speedy Nidoqueen and Salazzle paired with the bulky Toxapex and Dragalge, with Venusaur and Drapion for coverage, her team is well suited to deal with many of the strategies you might think to use. Earthquake is weakened by 4 times on this field, so that's not really an option. 

The key to this battle in my experience is letting Toxapex hang out on the left side and do everything in your power to incapacitate and knock out the Pokemon on the right. Toxapex does have Merciless which is always on, but still doesn't hit incredibly hard and will probably be going last unless it has gotten off a lot of Icy Wind. For that reason, putting Psychic-type attackers, and/or Steel/Poison-type defenders on the field and letting them tank attacks and knock out the threats will probably pay out. Ice is also a pretty good offensive type here, note that Freeze Dry can take four of her Pokemon super-effectively. You can also use your own entry hazard spam or the Telluric seed to boost a sweeper. If you could figure out Shelly way back when I think you can find a way to best Aya.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Aya on the first try (+1 Hardy, +1 Fern)

Once you win you'll get the *Blight Badge*, *TM34 Sludge Wave*, and get a Level 50 cap finally. We also get to use Strength in the field, finally!

# Episode 8: Of Fathers Forgotten

Make your way all the way back out of the Wasteland. You'll find Cain near the exit. Prepare for a fight.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- If Cain ran away from home earlier, say you know what he means (+1 Cain)

**Pretty Boy Cain (Berry Ice Cream). Field: Wasteland Field**
- Nidoking, Lv. 46, Ability: Sheer Force, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thrash
    - Throat Chop
    - Poison Tail
    - Shadow Ball
- Marowak-Alola, Lv. 44, Ability: Lightning Rod, Adamant Nature, IVs: 10
    - Flame Wheel
    - Bonemerang
    - Shadow Bone
    - Will-O-Wisp
- Meowstic-Female, Lv. 44, Ability: Competitive, Timid Nature, IVs: 10
    - Charge Beam
    - Psychic
    - Shadow Ball
    - Light Screen
- Muk-Alola, Lv. 44, Ability: Poison Touch, Brave Nature, IVs: 10
    - Gunk Shot
    - Minimize
    - Power-Up Punch
    - Knock Off
- Primarina, Lv. 45, @Zoom Lens, Ability: Torrent, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Water Pledge
    - Icy Wind
    - Disarming Voice
    - Sing

Another fight with Cain, this time on a field that benefits his team to some extent. Most of his Pokemon aren't very fast, so a fast sweeper or two can probably clean house. Just watch out for Muk who hits like a truck and also has Minimize for extra shenanigans.

Return to South Obsidia Ward.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you believe Cal (+1 Cal)
- Say you don't believe Cal (-1 Cal)

Cal will give you *TMX4 Strength*! 

## Strength Exploration

Having Strength means there is a lot of exploration that we can now do. First of all, put Chingling into your party with the Soothe Bell attached. We'll need it evolved for a quest soon, so might as well take advantage of all the walking we are about to do.

First, note that the Pokemarts and the candy store have new inventory now.

**Default Shop (5 Badges)**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Super Potion* |$700       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Super Repel*  |$700       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |
|*Great Ball*   |$600       |

**Sweet Kiss Bottom Clerk Shop (5 Badges)**

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy*     |$150       |
|*Exp. Candy XS*    |$500       |
|*Exp. Candy S*     |$2000      |
|*Exp. Candy M*     |$5000      |
|*Exp. Candy L*     |$10000     |
|*Rare Candy*       |$12000     |

Next, make your way all the way up to Citrine Mountain 2F via Beryl Bridge. Go down and right. You'll see a strength boulder. Push it from the top so it goes down. Then, make your way around to the left and step across the ice path that is now open. You will find a hidden *Shoal Salt* and *Red Shard* then find *TM94 Secret Power*. Exit the mountain.

Make your way west to the Beryl Cemetery. Victoria is down from here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria in the cemetery (+2 Victoria)

Next, we're gonna return to Byxbysion Wasteland. After exiting the tall building, head up over the ledge and enter the cave at the top. Push the boulder into the hole and follow it, then go into the now accessible cave. Prepare for a fight and talk to the grave. 

**Spectral Kiki. Field: Wasteland Field**
- Medicham, Lv. 65, Ability: Pure Power, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Meditate
    - Thunder Punch
    - Drain Punch
    - Ice Punch

Another tough fight with a single Pokemon but at this point you should have a strategy to deal with these.

Win and you'll obtain **Misdreavus**.

Back outside in the wasteland, make your way to the tunnels area and enter the room with two canisters. Head through the secret path to the left. When you get outside, go down the slide and enter the next room. Take the ladder up then immediately back down. Now we can move this boulder aside! Jump down the hidden ledge and move the next boulder to the left, then go up.

Here, you can find an *Exp. Candy L*, *TM12 Taunt*, and hidden *Ability Capsule* and *Nugget*. On rainy days you can also find a **Squirtle** chilling in the fountain, which we can catch. This is the first of the starters we can obtain aside from the starter table at the beginning of the game.

Return to the wasteland proper, and enter the tall building with stairs on the left side of the map. Show the Squirtle we caught to the guy inside for a *Data Chip*.

Next, take the boat to Apophyll. Head inside Pyrous Mountain and make your way up to 3F. Carefully maneuver the boulder into the hole here and follow it down. You'll find Tepig here, but talk to it and it will flee. Next, make your way to B1F and go to the right. Move the boulder and talk to Tepig again. Grab *TM37 Sandstorm* while you're here. Finally, make your way to the peak. Talk to **Tepig** and you'll be able to catch it!

Exit and take the boat to Azurine Island. At night, if your Chingling has enough friendship, it will evolve into **Chimecho**. Take Chimecho into the building where we battled Taka and show it to a guy here to obtain **Chikorita**. 

## Yureyu Building

With that out of the way, head into the Underground Railnet and use Strength to reach the top. Grab the now-accessible hidden *Red Shard* and enter the door with the Y. This room has a hidden *Great Ball* and *Dragon Gem*. Upstairs is a hidden *Exp. Candy M* and outside you can find a hidden *Link Stone* and *Exp. Candy L*. Head into the Yureyu building.

You'll be partnered with Cain.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk with Cain while you're in Yureyu (+1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Try to leave Yureyu while partnered with Cain (-1 Cain)

It's a very straightforward area: defeat all the Meteor grunts as you make your way up. Once we reach the floor that Sigmund is on, we'll have a story choice to make.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to refuse fighting Sigmund at Yureyu.**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say Yes to Sigmund asking if you'll fight him (+1 Heather, -1 Sigmund)
- Say No to Sigmund asking if you'll fight him (+1 Sigmund, -1 Heather, -1 Cain)

### Fought Sigmund at Yureyu Route

If you said no to Sigmund, skip ahead to the next section.

**Dr. Sigmund Connal (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Factory Field**
- Musharna, Lv. 45, @Amplifield Rock, Ability: Telepathy, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Psychic Terrain
    - Moonlight
    - Psyshock
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Drampa, Lv. 46, Ability: Berserk, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Thunderbolt
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Nature Power
    - Hyper Voice
- Raichu-Alola, Lv. 46, Ability: Surge Surfer, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Volt Switch
    - Psychic
    - Nasty Plot
    - Thunderbolt
- Hypno, Lv. 47, @Wide Lens, Ability: Insomnia, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Hypnosis
    - Nasty Plot
    - Psychic
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Rotom, Lv. 47, Ability: Levitate, Timid Nature, IVs: 25
    - Thunderbolt
    - Hex
    - Will-O-Wisp
    - Foul Play
- Electivire, Lv. 48, Ability: Motor Drive, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thunder Punch
    - Fire Punch
    - Low Kick
    - Ice Punch

Thanks to the assistance of Cain, this one shouldn't be too bad. Musharna will use Psychic Terrain like last time, and his Electric and Psychic core will try to wear you down. The Factory field will boost the former and the Psychic Terrain the latter, so make sure you neutralize whatever the biggest threat of your two opponent is each turn and you'll probably win.

### Didn't Fight Sigmund at Yureyu Route

If you said yes to Sigmund, skip ahead to the next section.

**Meteor Admin Sirius (2x Hyper Potion). Field: No Field**
- Minior, Lv. 45, Ability: Shields Down, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Shell Smash
    - Charge Beam
    - Power Gem
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Tyrantrum, Lv. 46, Ability: Strong Jaw, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Rock Slide
    - Crunch
    - Dragon Claw
    - Dragon Dance
- Toucannon, Lv. 46, Ability: Skill Link, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Beak Blast
    - Rock Blast
    - Tailwind
    - Roost
- Manectric, Lv. 47, Ability: Static, Timid Nature, IVs: 30
    - Flamethrower
    - Volt Switch
    - Discharge
    - Snarl
- Seviper, Lv. 47, @Leftovers, Ability: Shed Skin, Careful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Throat Chop
    - Poison Jab
    - Rest
    - Aqua Tail
- Chandelure, Lv. 48, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: Infiltrator, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Heat Wave
    - Energy Ball
    - Psychic
    - Shadow Ball

Thanks to the assistance of Cain, this one shouldn't be too tough. You'll have to be careful of Minior setting up. Otherwise his Pokemon are generally fast and strong but frail, so if you have good type advantages and basic doubles strategies you can certainly do it.

## Underground Railnet East

Back on the ground floor, head east to enter another part of the railnet. This room is pretty huge - scattered around you can find a hidden *Awakening*, *Revive*, *Super Potion*, *Resist Wing*, *Red-Hots*, *Swift Wing*, *Purple Shard*, *Protein*, *Cheri Berry*, 3 *Blue Shards*, 2 *PokeSnaxs*, and *Super Repel*.

You can also find a bunch more of those shallow walls that you can use Rock Smash on. Behind these are *House Key*, *Iron Ball*, *Corrupted Poke Ball*, and *TM44 Rest*. You can also open the gate to the left to create a shortcut to the Aron room. 

Talk to Shelly on the right side of the area, then enter the train at the bottom of the map. Back outside, you'll need to use levers to connect this train to the exit area on the right. Essentially you can just follow the tracks until you hit a roadblock, then backtrack and click the lever and follow the new path until you are all done. Talk to Noel when you have the correct layout. Re-enter the train, talk to Shelly if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Shelly she was helpful (+1 Shelly)
- Tell Shelly she was not helpful (-1 Shelly)

Talk to Charlotte - CHOO CHOO!

## Tanzan Cove

We will emerge in a new area. Here, you'll find a *Purple Shard*, *Full Heal*, *Normal Gem*, and *Elemental Seed*. If it's raining, a guy on this map will tell us about the password *stablweather*. You can actually choose whether to go to the Belrose Manse via Tanzan Mountain first, or to go to Spinel Town via the forest first. Here, we will go to Belrose first, but you can skip this section and come back to it after Spinel if you'd like.

**Tanzan Mountain**

|Cave                   |%  |

|Kecleon                |14 |
|**Sandile**            |6  |

On the left as you walk in, you'll see whichever of **Solrock** and **Lunatone** that you didn't get to catch earlier.

On this map, you'll find hidden *X Speed*, *PokeSnax*, *Hyper Potion*, 2 *Blue Shards*, *Revive*, *Ground Gem*, *Steel Gem*, *Escape Rope*, *Ultra Ball*, *Purple Shard*, and a visible *Exp. Candy XL*.

Talk to Charlotte then emerge at the top into Tanzan Cove.

In this area you can find a hidden *Escape Rope*, *Green Shard*, *Guard Spec.*, *Blue Shard*, *Peppermint*, *PokeSnax*, *Heart Scale*, *Rose Incense*, and *Elemental Seed*.

Enter the house at the top.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Enter Belrose Manse before going to Voclain Estate (+1 Noel, +1 Laura)

To the left you can see something glowing in a bookshelf. Interact with it to get the *Family Picture* for a sidequest way down the road. Anyways, talk to everyone in the house then head out.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly in Belrose Manse (+1 Shelly)

Make your way forward and around to the left. You'll see a cave entrance hidden behind a tree - walk up to this tree and it will teleport away.

**Chrysolia Spring 1F**

|**Gastrodon**     |1  |
|**Camerupt**      |1  |

More importantly, you'll find a *Mystic Water* and hidden *Link Stone* inside. 

Back outside, head to the left and down, and attempt to exit the forest. A nearby tree will disappear, so follow the newly created path. By now you've noticed that stuff is teleporting in and out - in general we want to follow the linear path forwards, even if it does take us through parts we've seen before.

Towards the bottom of the area you'll see a single tree blocking off an open patch of grass, approaching the tree will make it disappear. Down from here you'll find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Exp. Candy L*, and *Heart Scale*. To the right, you can talk to someone for the *Grassy Terrain Field Readout* and pick up a *Mild Mint* and a *Hasty Mint*. Enter the train to the left, and pick up the egg. It'll be **Cacnea** or **Maractus**, randomly determined.

Head back up and go left, continuing our linear travel through the teleporting tree forest. In the bottom right part of the forest you'll see a lone tree guarding a patch of grass - you know what to do. Follow this path to reach a cave.

**Lost Railcave**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Kecleon           |24 |
|**Graveler-Alola**|20 |

|Onix              |10 |
|**Swinub**        |10 |
|**Smeargle**      |6  |

Inside the railcave, start by entering the entrance that is not being pointed to by the three ends of the train tracks. Repeat this process over and over until you reach a room containing an *Ill-Fated Doll* as well as **Eevee**!

Back in the main area of the railcave, enter the room closest to two of the three rocks. Repeat this process over and over until you reach a room containing a hidden *Ability Capsule*, the *Psychic Terrain Field Readout*, and *TM32 Double Team*. 

Back in the forest, continue your circles around and around. Once you reach the upper right side of the area you'll see a path leading to the right. Here you'll find a hidden *Ability Capsule*. Head into the clearing here.

**Chrysolia Forest (Clearing)**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |

|**Altaria**       |5  |                  |   |                  |   |

You'll find a hidden *Elemental Seed* as well as the *Burning Field Readout*, a *Quiet Mint* and an *Exp. Candy L*. This is also the Mossy Rock where you can get Leafeon. 

Finally, continue your circles in the main part of the forest until you finally reach Spinel Town.

## Spinel Town

You'll notice that everything is chaos here, teleporting like crazy. Enter a house on the left side and a girl's furniture will all disappear. She'll ask us to get it back, so head out of her house.

Down from here, there's a tree in front of a house. The tree will move when you approach it. Inside, you can return the Kadabra girl's bed, and pick up the *Good Rod*! Outside, the fountain will disappear as you approach. Heading towards the center of town, you'll see the Kadabra girl's TV on top of a building. Trying to enter the Pokemart will cause it to teleport as well. To the right, you'll see Kadabra girl's bookshelf.

Enter the left apartment building. Inside, you'll find Kadabra girl's table. In the building to the right, a person inside will offer to trade your Shelmet and Karrablast for their respective evolutions. You will also be asked to pet every Eeveelution. This is a sidequest we won't be finishing for a very long time but at least we know.

Talk to a lady sitting on the bench, and she will completely disappear. Ok then. Go down and to the right: a house here will also disappear. Beyond it you will find Kadabra girl's first chair. Her second chair is up and to the right of the Pokemon Center. Speaking of, a guy inside the center will tell us a password: *hardcap*. 

Enter the museum. Unfortunately every time we enter here it will cost $500. You can explore the museum to learn a bunch of lore. Upstairs is a person who will revive our fossils! So, that means depending on what you've found mining it is now possible to get **Omanyte**, **Kabuto**, **Lileep**, **Anorith**, **Cranidos**, and Shieldon. Unfortunately to finish the revival you have to leave the museum and pay the fee again! I will note that if you only have a single Helix Fossil, there is a quest later on that requires us to have one, so consider saving it for now if you aren't dying to have an Omanyte right now.

Anyways, head down and out of the door upstairs here and into the door on the other side to pick up the *Eevium-Z*. We can't use Mega Stones or Z-Crystals yet. Kadabra girl's nightstand is also in here, as well as a standard Ice Cream vending machine that contains a Vanillite like in the Sweet Co.

In the downstairs area of the museum at night, you'll see two Meteor grunts. Talk to them and they will flee to Tanzan Mountain. We will get to them in a bit. There's a *Luxury Ball* in the trash to the right.

Outside, attempt to enter the Voclain Estate in the top right corner. Before you talk to Serra, talk to Bennett if you want points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett you knew Cascoon had perfect memories (+1 Bennett)

I hope they remember me killing 15 of them with Fire-type moves in Pokemon Legends Arceus. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Bennett a second time (+1 Bennett)

In the upstairs rooms, you can find *Silk Scarf*, the *Mirror Arena Field Readout*, *TM85 Dream Eater*, *Bug Memory*, and *Weakness Policy*. You'll also find Kadabra girl's last bookshelf in Bennett's room.

With that, we should now have all of the furniture back, so return to the girl to get the *Exp. All*. An excellent item that levels your whole team and prevents leveling over the cap.

Grab your Male Burmy from the PC and level it to 20 so it evolves into **Mothim**.
Return to Chrysolia Forest - you'll have to basically do the circles in reverse. On your way you'll find the house that teleported earlier. A guy inside will do an in-game trade: your Mothim for his **Bruxish**.

Down from here, you'll find the teleported fountain. **Remoraid** will jump out for you to battle.

Return to Tanzan Mountain. Inside, you'll find the grunts from earlier. Defeat them and return to the museum. Talk to the museum guy to get your choice of *Plume Fossil* or *Armor Fossil*, which you can revive for **Archen** and **Tirtouga** respectively.

## Good Rod Encounters and Other Things

Now that we have a new rod there are a lot of encounters we can now get.

**Chrysolia Spring 1F**

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Shellos           |60 |
|Barboach          |20 |
|**Clauncher**     |20 |

**Tanzan Cove**

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Basculin**      |60 |
|Mantyke           |20 |
|**Luvdisc**       |20 |

Make sure you catch a Luvdisc for an in-game trade we'll get to in a bit.

Once you return to Reborn City via the railnet, we can now snag the other gang mascot than ours. If you joined Magma Gang, head over to Lapis Alleyway. 

**Lapis Alleyway**

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Barboach          |80 |
|**Carvanha**      |20 |

If you joined Aqua Gang, head over to North Obsidia Alleyway, where you will be able to find **Houndour** inside.

Anyways, some more encounters:

**Lower Peridot Ward / Azurine Island / Apophyll Beach / Coral Ward**

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Muk               |60 |
|**Tentacool**     |20 |
|Skrelp            |20 |

**Lower Peridot Ward Pool**

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Goldeen           |60 |
|Finneon           |20 |
|Seaking           |20 |

**The Underroot**

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Psyduck           |60 |
|Skrelp            |20 |
|**Whiscash**      |20 |

The other important thing we can do in Reborn City is to head on over to Onyx Ward and return the House Key to the girl here to get a *Heart Scale*. She is the Move Relearner and will trade us relearned moves for Heart Scales... which we have in spades via mining. Take advantage of this as you like, then take the boat to Apophyll. 

Grab Luvdisc from the PC, then head along the outer right wall of the academy to find someone who'll do an in-game trade: your Luvdisc for their **Darumaka**. 

That wraps up this part, so head all the way back through the railnet and the forest to Spinel Town and enter the Voclain Estate.

## Rime Badge

Enter the room towards the back to reach the gym. In each room, you'll have to look for something that's wrong on one of the two sides. It could be a misplaced or miscolored item or something thematically tied to the gym. Anyways, once you find this discrepancy, smash the wall immediately above. 

For each of the three puzzle rooms (so, a max of +3), you can get the following:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Smash the correct mirror on the first try (+1 Serra)
- Smash 2-5 incorrect mirrors before finding the answer (-1 Serra)
- Smash 6-7 incorrect mirrors before finding the answer (-2 Serra)

Save before you enter the third room.

**Lepidopterist Bennett (2x Berry Ice Cream). Field: Mirror Arena**

    - Flame Charge
    - Bug Bite

- Butterfree, Lv. 50, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: Compound Eyes, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sleep Powder
    - Quiver Dance
    - Signal Beam
    - Giga Drain

It's time for our first battle with Bennett. Despite mainly using the crappy early game bugs, he pretty strongly optimizes his team around the Mirror Field. All of the accuracy and evasion items and abilities raise his team's chance to get critical hits, and his Pokemon hit moderately hard and fast. Literally all but one of them have Quiver Dance too, so they'll probably try to set up on you. That said, his Bugs are all pretty frail and have lots of weaknesses - simply loading up on Rock moves will probably solve most of the problem. You can also take advantage of the Mirror Field yourself, if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:** 
- Beat Bennett on the first try (+1 Elias, -1 Bennett)
- Beat Bennett on the second, etc. try (+1 Bennett, -1 Elias)

Break the last mirror and head into the gym arena when you're ready.

**Beauty Queen Serra (3x Hyper Potion). Field: Mirror Arena**
- Glaceon, Lv. 48, @Light Clay, Ability: Snow Cloak, Calm Nature, IVs: 31
    - Wish

    - Ice Beam
    - Double Team
    - Pain Split
    - Shadow Ball

Serra is a tough gym leader that operates on a very unique field effect - instead of thinking about how to beat a Hail-team like you normally would, you really should study the field effect in detail to devise a strategy. Anyways, her Bright Powder, Wide Lens, and Synthetic Seeds as well as Snow Cloak abilities all raise accuracy or evasion and boost critical-hit rate. For that reason you won't really be able to pull off a Special Defense boosting strategy nor use your own screens. In general, physical attackers will have a much harder time here since when they miss, they take damage. Special attackers have a chance to hit anyways even when they miss - some attacks are even boosted, which explains why Serra has five special attackers. Her Jynx, Froslass, and Sandslash under Hail are all incredibly fast and like to try to crit you. On the flip side, Glaceon, Alola-tales, and Lapras are a bit tankier, the latter two like to set up free 8-turn Aurora Veil to further support their defensive strategy. All in all this is a tough fight that doubles down on the weaknesses of the Ice-type and uses the Mirror Arena to great effect.

In general, your own weather and Brick Break / Psychic Fangs to fight Aurora Veil are generally good options, but as I said the field is also tough to overcome. Luckily, as stacked the Mirror Arena is for Serra, you can pretty easily use it to your benefit as well.  There is a list of abilities that you can use to get Accuracy or Evasion, we also have access to the Lax Incense and Zoom Lens at this point. All of these will allow you to get a boosted critical hit ratio - with priority, that means you can pick up some easy one shots on the glass cannons. The accuracy ones in particular will allow your physical attackers to overcome the Evasion + misses + recoil damage and capitalize on the low Defense on Serra's Pokemon. Mirror Coat is a good option that you can use situationally to boost your defensive stats. All of these are nice, but it turns out there's something EVEN BETTER that you can use. That is, Nature Power turns into Mirror Shot, which is boosted by two times and will always lower accuracy. That means any Special Attacker with access to Nature Power can use a 130 BP Steel-type move that will never miss... against a team full of Ice types - only Glaceon and Lapras take neutral damage from it. 

It's worth noting that there are a list of moves in the Field Notes that can destroy the Mirror Arena entirely. This can be another viable strategy to force Serra to play on a more even playing field. However:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Break the Mirror Field in the gym fight (-1 Serra)

Once you win, you'll get the *Rime Badge* which boosts our cap to Lv. 55. You'll also get *TM70 Aurora Veil*. 

# Episode 9: Sister's Keeper

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Serra on the couch after the battle (+1 Serra)

Exit the gym.

## Two Herbal Extracts

Make your way out of Spinel Town and head back towards Tanzan Mountain. You'll finally be able to enter the Pokemart here! One person sells the default items, but there is another vendor.

**Chrysolia Pokemart Herb Shop**

|Item               |Price  |
|-------------------|-------|
|*Herbal Extract*   |$600   |
|*Energy Powder*    |$500   |
|*Heal Powder*      |$450   |

The Powders aren't really worth it unless you're going for a Frustration build, but we will need two Herbal Extracts: one for a sidequest and one to continue the story.

If you chose to go to Spinel Town before Belrose Manse, you can read the above section on Tanzan Cove for encounters, items, etc. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeated Serra and got Herbal Medicine before entering the Belrose Manse (+1 Charlotte)

Anyways, head to Belrose Manse and go upstairs. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Noel without Herbal Extract in your inventory (-1 Noel)

Give the medicine to Anna and she will feel better. Head outside.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly while Noel wants to battle you.

We can talk to Noel to advance the plot, but we can actually use the second Herbal Extract we got right now to get a nice reward, so I'll take care of that now. 

Head over to the Chrysolia Forest and go up. You'll find the lady that was teleported off the bench here. Give her the Herbal Extract to get *Department Store Sticker: Chansey*. 

**Department Store 7F Left Shop**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Psychic Gem*  |$1200          |
|*Bug Gem*      |$1200          |
|*Rock Gem*     |$1200          |
|*Ghost Gem*    |$1200          |
|*Dark Gem*     |$1200          |
|*Dragon Gem*   |$1200          |
|*Steel Gem*    |$1200          |
|*Ice Gem*      |$1200          |
|*Fairy Gem*    |$1200          |

**Department Store 7F Right Shop**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Fire Gem*     |$1200          |
|*Water Gem*    |$1200          |
|*Normal Gem*   |$1200          |
|*Grass Gem*    |$1200          |
|*Electric Gem* |$1200          |
|*Poison Gem*   |$1200          |
|*Ground Gem*   |$1200          |
|*Fighting Gem* |$1200          |
|*Flying Gem*   |$1200          |

You can grab some gems if you have a strategy that relies on them such as Flying-gem Acrobatics or Unburden Normal-gem Fake Out.

With that out of the way, head back to the Tanzan Cove. Prepare your team for a battle and talk to Noel...

## Defending Belrose Manse

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Saphira you don't understand (-1 Saphira)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you want to beat Meteor faces (+1 Charlotte)

The story will diverge a little bit depending on what our choice was at Yureyu. This section gets a bit hairy since there are FOUR different story splits. Let me know if you have suggestions or spot discrepancies since I cannot play all four routes at once.

### Fought Sigmund at Yureyu Route Part 2

If you didn't fight Sigmund at Yureyu and instead fought Sirius, skip ahead to the next section.

Anyways, you'll have to first fight two orderlies. Afterwards, you'll be healed but thrust into another battle.

**Meteor Admin Sirius (3x Hyper Potion). Field: No Field**
- Minior, Lv. 48, Ability: Shields Down, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Shell Smash
    - Dazzling Gleam
    - Power Gem
    - Psychic
- Tyrantrum, Lv. 49, Ability: Strong Jaw, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Earthquake
    - Crunch
    - Dragon Claw
    - Dragon Dance
- Toucannon, Lv. 50, Ability: Skill Link, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Beak Blast
    - Rock Blast
    - Tailwind
    - Roost
- Manectric, Lv. 50, Ability: Static, Timid Nature, IVs: 30
    - Volt Switch
    - Discharge
    - Flamethrower
    - Snarl
- Seviper, Lv. 51, @Leftovers, Ability: Shed Skin, Careful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Throat Chop
    - Poison Jab
    - Rest
    - Aqua Tail
- Chandelure, Lv. 52, @Wise Glasses, Ability: Infiltrator, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Heat Wave
    - Energy Ball
    - Psychic
    - Shadow Ball

On this route this is our first battle with Sirius, and we don't get a partner. His team is all about hitting hard with well-rounded coverage. In particular you have to watch out for his Chandelure's fast coverage, Minior's set up if you have a bad lead against it, and Manectric's fast offense and pivot move. The rest are fairly slow. At this point in the game you should have a pretty solid team that can hopefully take care of Sirius.

Afterwards, the game will give us another choice that affects the story! Either we will go upstairs or stay downstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Go Upstairs after fighting Sirius (+1 Charlotte, +1 Shelly, +1 Noel, -1 Saphira, -1 Laura, -1 Sigmund)
- Stay Downstairs after fighting Sirius (+1 Charlotte, +1 Shelly, +1 Saphira)

If you chose to stay downstairs the Twins will be captured. Talk to the group in the kitchen to the right. 

If you go upstairs, this results in Laura being captured. Talk to Saphira downstairs. 

### Didn't Fight Sigmund at Yureyu Part 2

If you fought Sigmund at Yureyu, skip ahead to the next section.

Anyways, it's time for another battle with the doc.

**Dr. Sigmund Connal (2x Hyper Potion). Field: No Field**
- Musharna, Lv. 48, @Amplifield Rock, Ability: Telepathy, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Psychic Terrain
    - Moonlight
    - Psyshock
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Drampa, Lv. 49, Ability: Berserk, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Thunderbolt
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Nature Power
    - Hyper Voice
- Raichu-Alola, Lv. 49, Ability: Surge Surfer, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Volt Switch
    - Psychic
    - Nasty Plot
    - Thunderbolt
- Hypno, Lv. 50, @Wide Lens, Ability: Insomnia, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Hypnosis
    - Nasty Plot
    - Psychic
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Rotom, Lv. 50, Ability: Levitate, Timid Nature, IVs: 25
    - Thunderbolt
    - Hex
    - Will-O-Wisp
    - Foul Play
- Electivire, Lv. 51, Ability: Motor Drive, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thunder Punch
    - Fire Punch
    - Low Kick
    - Ice Punch

This fight can be tough thanks to his usage of the very broken Psychic Terrain - it will double Musharna's speed, boost his Psychic attacks plus Hex, and make Hypnosis actually reliable. As before you can consider knocking out Musharna then trying to stall out the terrain to neutralize his strategy. His Electivire is fast and hits hard with Ice Punch, so be careful with your Ground type. A well rounded team will be able to succeed with the right approach.

Afterwards, you will make another choice that will affect the game! 

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to stop Sigmund after fighting him.**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Choose to stop Sigmund after fighting him (+1 Saphira, +1 Shelly, +1 Charlotte, +1 Noel, +1 Anna, +1 Shade, -1 Laura, -2 Sigmund)
- Choose to stop Sirius after fighting Sigmund (+1 Laura, -2 Saphira, -1 Noel)

If Saphira was abducted, you'll also see a hole in the wall that opens up. You can actually use the hole instead of the door to enter and exit.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Exit or enter the Belrose Manse through the hole in the wall (-1 Laura)

## Tanzan Meteor Base

With that, we can now enter the Tanzan Mountain and take back whoever you ended up getting kidnapped by Team Meteor.

Head into Tanzan Mountain and go to the right as soon as you can. Depending on your earlier choices either Laura or Saphira will be here. Talk to them and you will be able to use the rock to nicely remove the barrier or freely pass through it after Dragonite destroys it. 

The next room contains a hidden *Green Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, and *Blue Shard*. Enter the base. 

There will be a lot of these rotary thingies all over the base. Essentially they will send you 90 degrees in the indicated direction, but once you use it, it'll send you in the opposite direction next time. So, you'll only be able to go left for now. Head up and into the room. 

This next room has tiles that will teleport you to the same color equivalent in a different room - and those in that room will teleport you back. You'll need to reach the top of each room to deactivate a panel. To succeed, one strategy is this: 

Use the left panel, then go left, down, up, up and use the computer. Spam down and eventually you can return to the bottom of the room. Ensuring we are starting in the right room this time, use the right panel, then go right, down, up, up, and use this computer. Spam down, again use the white panels at the bottom to pop out in the right side, then head up via the rotator and go in.

Use this rotary to go left. Head into the room at the bottom to grab *PULSE Readout 7*. 

Enter the room to the left. If anyone except Saphira was abducted earlier, you can get relationship points here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- After Noel and Anna are abducted, talk to them in the cage (+2 Noel)
- After Charlotte and Shelly are abducted, talk to them in the cage (+1 Shelly, +1 Charlotte)
- After Laura is abducted, talk to her in the cage (+1 Laura)

Return to the previous room, then go up. There is only one path you can take for now, so beat the grunts and take it. You'll see a purple tile, step on it and you'll end up in the left side of the base again. Once more go up, this time, you'll be sent up. Go left onto the blue tile for now, then the rotary will send you down again. In the next room you'll go to the right this time. You'll get an *Exp. Candy L*!

Use the teleporter and you'll emerge on the right side of the area. Enter the room on the right, pick up the *Revive* at the bottom, then talk to Saphira. You'll have to fight two grunts.

Head back to the left and take the rotary to go up. Talk to the grunts and scientists up here and talk to the computers to open up the door at the top as well as a shortcut in the bottom-left corner. Talk to Simon here (he won't fight you) to start up a sidequest later.

Enter the door at the top!

## Tanzan Depths

If Saphira was abducted, you'll be here with Laura.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Laura in the depths (+2 Laura)

Go out and head up. You'll see some dialogue. Head down from here, you'll see a new path open up. Continue this process until you have to participate in a battle!

**Pokemon Gargantuan. Field: Rocky Field**
- Steelix-Mega, Lv. 75, @Sitrus Berry, Ability: Sand Force, Careful Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/4/0/0/252/0
    - Earthquake
    - Stone Edge
    - Crunch
    - Heavy Slam

Another single Pokemon boss, this time with a Mega Steelix. Since it's slow you can wear it down with Special moves. Counter also works well if you can take a hit. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Steelix on the first try (+3 Saphira, +1 Laura)
- Beat Steelix on the second, third, etc. try (+2 Saphira)

**Tanzan Depths (Main Areas)**

|Cave              |%  |

|Onix              |20 |

|**Hippopotas**    |6  |
|**Dugtrio**       |5  |
|**Durant**        |5  |

Once you emerge, make your way back into the base and head to the back room. Once you do it will be time for another fight! 

**Meteor Admin ZEL. Field: Factory Field**
- PULSE Abra, Lv. 75, @Silk Scarf, Ability: Magic Guard, Modest Nature, IVs: 31.
    - Hyper Beam
    - Dark Pulse
    - Hyper Beam
    - Hyper Beam

Seriously. Of course, when you're only fighting one Pokemon with very low HP that has to deal with recharge much of the time, it shouldn't be too hard. Disabling Dark pulse will let your Ghost sit there for free, Mirror Coat and Metal Burst can work great here, etc. There's lots of options for this one. 

Head all the way back to Tanzan Cove and talk to Anna inside. It's time for another gym battle!

    - Soft-Boiled
    - Stored Power

Shocker, another tough gym leader in Pokemon Reborn. You'll notice that Noel uses Normal types on a field that doesn't really benefit most of his moves, instead, he'll mainly profit off of the free healing each turn. His seeded Clefable, Girafarig, and Bewear in particular are all fairly bulky and have good coverage to mess up your team. With the addition of a Porygon-Z who gets extra bulk thanks to its seed and hits like a truck and the demon spawn known as King's Rock Cinccino, you're in for a tough fight against a well-rounded Normal-type team (ok, 5/6ths of a Normal-type team plus Clefable).

Clefable's Magic Guard is an annoying ability that means you need to overwhelm it physically despite its seed boost or get it before it can Calm Mind too much, but thankfully it means it doesn't have Unaware. This means you can get your own sweeper set up potentially against Bewear or Girafarig and maybe steamroll his team. Fighting types can potentially destroy the Cinccino but won't see a ton of success against the rest of the team. Since Normal-types have no other weaknesses, you might have to turn to using the field to your benefit. Although Girafarig has Sap Sipper to absorb Grass-type moves, you can go with a hyper-offensive Grass-type strategy, keeping Swellow in mind. Coil and Growth are boosted on this field, so it shouldn't be impossible to set up. You can also take advantage of the boost to Fire-moves - in particular Bewear will get crushed by them. Keep in mind too that the Elemental Seed can potentially allow you to more easily survive Cinccino and/or get your own tank set up. 

In a pinch, this fight becomes much easier if you change the field to the Burning Field or the Corrosive Field. However Laura doesn't like you destroying her flower garden!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Noel on Burning Field (-2 Laura)
- Beat Noel on Corrosive Field (-1 Laura)

For winning, you'll get the *Standard Badge* which boosts our cap to 60. We'll also get *TM10 Hidden Power*! 

# Episode 10: Into Darkness

Back inside, talk to the crew here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Laura on the couch (+1 Laura)

Next, talk to Noel in the stairs room. You'll hear a non-Julia boom, indicating it's time to return to Tanzan Mountain once more.

## Tanzan Mountain Boom and Goodies

Enter Tanzan Mountain and this time go to the left. You'll see a barrier is now destroyed, so follow the path. Snag a hidden *Potion*, *Green Shard*, and *Hyper Potion* then go up into the next room. Grab the *X Sp. Atk* and go up to find Saphira. 

You'll get the *Ruby Ring* and *Amethyst Pendant*! Sweet.

There are also hidden *Ice Heal*, *Red Shard*, and *Revive* here. The room to the right contains nothing we can do for now however. If we head up, we can reach the next area to progress the story, however there are a few goodies here in Tanzan Mountain that we can now access.

Make your way back to where the meteor base was and use the cave on the right to get to the Depths. In this first room you can find 2 hidden *Green Shards*, *Burn Heal*, *Potion*, and *Clever Wing*. 

Enter the room at the bottom. This is the room where Steelix was tunneling previously. Going straight to the right, you'll find a *Metal Coat* - meaning you can now get your own!

Head up and to the left. You'll see a new cave entrance here. Inside you'll find the *Thick Club* as well as some mining rocks. Back outside this room go up, you'll see an iron girder opening a path to a new room.

**Tanzan Depths (Across the Beam)**

|Hippopotas        |5  |
|Durant            |5  |
|**Hippowdon**         |1  |

Here you can grab an *Upgrade*. 

That's all for now, so you can Dig or Escape Rope to get back to Tanzan Mountain proper and go up from the area where you got the jewelry from Saphira.

## Route 1

Only in Pokemon Reborn do we finally reach Route 1 after getting 7 badges.

We actually start in the South Aventurine Woods, however.

**South Aventurine Woods**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |

|Headbutt Rare     |%  |Headbutt Common   |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Combee            |40 |Combee            |40 |
|Swablu            |25 |Swablu            |25 |

|Mothim            |4  |**Wormadam**      |4  |

To this day I don't really understand "Rare" vs. "Common" headbutt trees... but you can always evolve a Burmy to get the other one if it's not working out.

You'll find hidden *Purple Shard* and *Green Shard* here, but we can't go left or right in this area quite yet. Instead, head up and enter Route 1 proper... but prepare yourself.

    - Swords Dance
    - Leaf Blade
    - Spirit Shackle
    - Shadow Sneak

Oh boy, if Fern was ever a tough fight, wait until he has the power of a beneficial field behind him. His Roserade and Decidueye are as always a tough combo: Roserade will put you to sleep, Decidueye will try to sweep, and both will sit back, passively heal, and enjoy the field boosts. His Rhydon is annoyingly tanky thanks to its Eviolite and has wide coverage but doesn't hit too hard. His Haxorus and Krookodile (and Scyther, I guess) will try to sweep you with attack / speed boosts. 

A good sweeper can find some success if they resist Haxorus or Rhydon's attacks, but you'll have to watch out for Shadow Sneak. You can also mutate the field to Burning if you want, obviously neutering his Grass types instead of helping them. I'd make the case that Noel is overall a harder fight than Fern in general so by making it here you should be able to succeed.

So, now we get to explore Route 1. It's quite huge.

**Route 1**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Deerling          |20 |Deerling          |20 |Arbok             |24 |

|**Mudsdale**      |1  |**Mudsdale**      |1  |                  |   |

You'll also find pairs of Tauros and Bouffalant all over the route. If you fight Tauros, the Bouffalant will go running off in the direction it's facing, which means that any logs in the way will be pushed. If you fight Bouffalant, Tauros will let you ride it, meaning you can now go up ledges. Game changer.

As a note: there are a bunch of entrances to the North and South Aventurine Woods scattered about Route 1. I'll cover the optional sidequests in the woods a bit later on in the guide fully, so for now I will just focus on Route 1 itself mainly.

Before hopping up or down any edges, you can find a hidden *Nugget* here. Head down one ledge to the left, in this area you can find hidden *Blue Shard*, *Red Shard*, and *Purple Shard*. Head down the ledge to the left. Here you'll find hidden *X Sp. Atk*, *Elemental Seed*, and *Blue Shard*. Go down the next ledge to find hidden *Carbos*, *Green Shard*, and *Great Ball*. Hop down the ledge to the left to get hidden *Escape Rope*, *Blue Shard*, and *Grass Gem*. The Miltank around here will do a trade with us: one Oran Berry for its *Moomoo Milk*. Make sure you have at least one Moomoo Milk in your bag for a quest way later. Anyways, head inside.

Someone on the first floor will give us 8 *Honeys*. Useful for a quest we'll embark on in a bit. Upstairs someone will give us the password *allfieldapp*, and another person will tell us they lost their glasses. This will also be our main healing hub for now. Upstairs, you can do an in-game trade: our Dunsparce for **Tyrogue**. Nice. Grab the *Wide Lens* here as well.

Back outside, head down the ledge here. You'll find a hidden *Dragon Gem*. Down another ledge, you can grab a *Lax Mint* as well as a hidden *Magical Seed*. Down again you'll find hidden *Ice Heal* and *PokeSnax*. Finally, on the bottom tier, you can find hidden *Red Shard*, *Purple Shard*, and *Pokeball*. You'll notice inside the gate at the bottom we can't do anything, so head back out. Knock out a Bouffalant to get a mount and we can head back up Route 1!

This time, as you go right, take the time to knock out every single Tauros. Even if we can't see them right now, there are logs in the woods that Bouffalant will be able to take care of for us, so it's a good idea to move every single one of them right now while we're exploring Route 1 anyways.

You'll notice as you go that you will be unable to go through tall grass on your Tauros. The first time it totally blocks your progress right, enter the forest entrance directly up from this area.

**North Aventurine Woods**

You can also find a hidden *Pokeball* in here. Make your way out to the right and back onto Route 1.

You'll eventually make your way back to the area where we fought Fern. To progress to the right while still on your Tauros, you'll need to have a Bouffalant move a log. Anyways, to the right you can find an *Exp. Candy L* as well as 2 hidden *Green Shards*, and *Electric Gem*. Note while you're here that you can pet Flareon, the first of many Eeveelutions we'll need to pet for that sidequest.

On the next ledge to the right you'll find a *Great Ball*, *Ether*, and *Tiny Mushroom*. To the right you'll need to use the bottom of three ledges to make it to the right on your Tauros. Up here you'll find hidden *Great Ball* and *Super Potion*. The ledge to the right is the only one on the route that goes downwards - past it, you can find hidden *Chewing Gum*, *Telluric Seed*, *PP Up*, *Red Shard*, and *Heart Scale*. You'll notice we can't access the area at the bottom-right while on a Tauros, so we'll come back here later on. Continue knocking out the Tauros to get Bouffalant to push logs as we progress.

On the next hill you can get a hidden *PokeSnax*, *Purple Shard*, and *Pokeball*. Use the bottom of two ledges to head up and grab a hidden *Dire Hit*, then head up once more. Pick up the hidden *Poke Ball*, *Red Shard*, *Zinc*, *Ghost Gem*, 2 *Purple Shards*, and *Synthetic Seed*. In the bottom corner you can use Strength to get a *Protector*. 

With that out of the way, dismount off your Tauros with 'A' and jump down the ledges down and to the left until we reach the secluded part we skipped earlier. Beat this final Tauros to move one more log, then grab the hidden *Super Repel*. Up above you should find another pair of fighting bulls - beat Bouffalant to get another Tauros mount, then return all the way to the right. We can't do anything in the top area for now, so head down and into the Vanhanen Labyrinth.

Grab the *Purple Shard* in a nearby rock then enter the castle. 

Heal and prep your team, then enter the next room. Here we can pet Umbreon for the quest, but make sure you do this now since this is a limited time petting opportunity! 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Luna's Umbreon (+1 Luna)

Anyways, talk to Luna.

This battle features the new Chess Field. While stuff like Grassy Terrain and Super-Heated Field are farily intuitive, you really should read up about Chess field as much as possible and use this battle to learn the ins-and-outs. Essentially each team member will get a chess board piece rank that will affect various things like stat boosts and even priority. They are fixed for each ordered team, although some will change depending on ordering, so keep that in mind as you make a chess board team. Luckily this means that the opponents' teams will always use the same ranks, so I will list them for each chess fight.

Anyways, with all that said, Cain doesn't really have a ton of optimization here with his team, although it is getting better. He now uses Mimikyu, which is of course annoying thanks to its ability and optimal moveset. His Muk and Nidoking are strong as ever, and his Primarina and Marowak may be slow but will hit you really hard. The key to winning this one is probably just consistent fast offense with a couple of things in the back to deal with Mimikyu and Nidoking if need be.

Anyways, once you win, we can talk to Luna.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Luna after G.Gardevoir is captured (+1 Luna)

Head back out and talk to Radomus and Cain again. Then exit via the labyrinth, hop on a Tauros and make your way all the way down the route to the Grand Stairway that was empty earlier. Note that we will need to win another one of those "impossible story battles" coming up soon to keep open our options for a postgame route, so plan your team accordingly. 

## Citae Astrae

Once you enter, you'll see El run to the left. Follow him, then talk to Radomus to jump down. You can find a hidden *Star Piece*. Talk to Radomus and go down. Grab the hidden *Stardust* and go down the ladder. 

Hey look! We made it to another chunk of the grand stairway that we couldn't access earlier. Grab hidden *Burn Heal*, *Repel*, *Big Pearl*, *Full Heal*, and *Super Repel* as you make your way right. In the next room, pick up 3 hidden *Purple Shards*, then exit to the left. Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy L* and go down the ladder. In this room you can find a hidden *Stardust* and 3 *Star Pieces*. Go up and into the new area.

After a scene, you'll be free to explore. 

**Citae Astrae Bottom**

|Land              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Unown             |44 |
|**Drowzee**       |20 |
|**Baltoy**        |20 |
|**Elgyem**        |14 |
|**Claydol**       |1  |
|**Hypno**         |1  |

In this area, you can find 5 hidden *Star Pieces*, *Shoal Shell*, and *Shiny Stone*. Say that ten times fast. 

Enter the building here. We can use our Ruby Ring to access a door. Inside, you'll find the first of many of Reborn's logic-by-contradiction puzzles. The ones in here shouldn't be too crazy, so I recommend solving these yourself. Anyways, the answer:

> Chimchar Dark, Monferno Dark, Infernape Light

After the puzzle, go through the teleporter. You can actually make your way back through the purple teleporter to grab a *Exp. Candy XL*. With that, head up and into the door.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree to give Adrienn the ring (+1 Adrienn, -1 Cain)
- Refuse to give Adrienn the ring (-1 Adrienn, +1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Adrienn about the pronouns when the player is Non-binary (+1 Adrienn)

Note that we will eventually get points for free for being the other genders too. Enter the red door for another logic puzzle.

> Hitmonchan: Dark, Hitmonlee: Light, Tyrogue: Light, Hitmontop: Dark

Use the Light Shard (or wait till we catch a few Pokemon) and head out.

**Citae Astrae Top**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Unown             |64 |
|Natu              |20 |
|**Xatu**          |10 |
|**Sigilyph**      |6  |

Once you're ready, talk to El at the top. You will have to choice between siding with El, or Radomus. If you choose the former, you're allowed to lose the upcoming battle, but if you choose the latter, you must win to progress.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to side with Radomus and win.**

**Parson El (2x Full Heal). Field: Crystal Cavern Field**
- Arceus, Lv. 75, @Leftovers, Ability: Multitype, Quiet Nature
    - Recover
    - Judgment
    - Shadow Ball
    - Focus Blast

One thing to note is that Judgement will cycle between gaining Fire, Water, Grass, and Psychic-type bonus damage. Using that fact, lowering its special attack, or using one of the strategies we've seen so far to deal with these 6v1 "impossible" fights should suffice if you want to win.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Side with El and lose (+3 Elias, +1 Adrienn, -3 Gardevoir, -2 Luna, -2 Radomus)
- Side with El and win (+1 Cain, +2 Elias, +2 Adrienn, -2 Gardevoir, -2 Luna, -2 Radomus)
- Side with Radomus and win (+2 Radomus, +2 Luna, +3 Gardevoir, +1 Anna, +1 Shade, +1 Cain, -1 Adrienn, -2 Elias)

With that, agree to leave together. Exit out of the Grand Gate, then make your way to Coral Ward. Talk to Adrienn here, then accept fast travel if you wish back to Vanhanen Castle. I will recommend not doing that so we can prep for an upcoming sidequest.

We're gonna need about 30 Honeys for the next section - you can either buy it directly, buy about 25 Ice Creams and/or Candies to trade in a bit, or a single Blue Moon Ice Cream works too.

It's worth noting that we can buy Exp. Candy XL's now:

## North Aventurine Woods Exploration

Once you're ready, head to the Route 1 Nature Center, grab a Tauros mount, and go right. Enter 1N, the first entrance to the forest that you see. This will simply spit us out at 2N. To the right, you'll find 3N. 

Go up and you'll find a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and a *Potion*. A web will block us from proceeding, so we'll have to dismount up here and walk through the tall grass to the left. You can talk to the tree here to slather it with honey - when you do, Heracross and Pinsir will show up and fight for it (immediately, unlike past versions). If you need a nearby web broken, defeat Pinsir and Heracross will do it for you. If you need a nearby log broken, defeat Heracross, and Pinsir will do it for you. Note that throughout the woods we cannot catch these two bugs. Anyways, defeat the Pinsir here.

Head to the right from here and go through another set of tall grass, but don't go down this ledge just yet. If you do, step on the flower but don't pull out the Floral Charm just set - I'm saving that for a specific flower later on. Not pulling it out will send you back to Route 1, whenever you get stuck.

Down from here, you'll find a hidden *Mental Herb* and another honey tree. Interact with it twice and defeat both bugs to get a *Leaf Stone* and *TM86 Grass Knot*. Exit back to Route 1, hop on a Tauros, and head back into 3N. Pass the old web spot and go up the next ledge, then dismount. Grab the hidden *Oran Berry* and *Elemental Seed* then enter the cave.

Grab the hidden *Ether* and *Repel*, then make your way to the ice puzzle. Slide your way to the center, then slide left and up from the top left part of the center to get the *Icy Field Readout*. Oh, and the Icy Rock to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is here as well. Slide to the left and down to head down some stairs from here.

Pick up an *Ice Stone* up here as well as a hidden *Potion*. You can also find *TM23 Smack Down* in here. Do some fishing if you'd like, then exit out to the woods the way we came in.

Grab a Tauros mount and head east from 3N in search for 4N. Once you find it, grab the hidden *Dire Hit* and *Big Mushroom*. To the left, you'll find a web we can destroy next to a Honey Tree, but there's no point to using a Honey on this one actually. Head back to the right and go up, then dismount. Past the tall grass, you'll find some soil to plant berries in if you'd like as well as the *Pikanium-Z* and a *Green Shard*. Enter the building here.

A Pikachu on the ground floor is actually a tutor.

**Nyu's Pikachu Move Tutor**

| Move      |Price  |
|-----------|-------|
|Volt Tackle|Free   |

Talk to the guy upstairs - he will tell us he is the PC administrator, and also heal our Pokemon! You can also talk to him with candy or ice cream in your bag - he will give us 3 *Honeys* for each. If we give him *Blue Moon Ice Cream*, we'll get *40 Honeys*. 

Back outside, go right. You'll see another Honey tree - defeat Pinsir to clear some webs. We can ignore the nearby log. Grab the hidden *Burn Heal* and go up - we'll be blocked by a log for now! So, exit to Route 1, hop on a Tauros, and enter 5N to the right. Pick up the hidden *Red Shard*, and witness the conversation to the right.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you did see that just now (-1 Titania)
- Say you didn't see that just now (-2 Titania)

To the right, 6N will spit us back out onto Route 1, so find 7N to the east. Pick up the hidden *Paralyze Heal*. Dismount if you haven't already, then go left and up. You'll find a Honey tree - beat Heracross to clear a log to the left. Head back down and to the right here, then go up through the tall grass. There's another Honey tree - beat Heracross again to clear a log.

Head back out to Route 1, and pick up a Tauros mount. Head right back in to 7N and go up the ledge at the top. Grab the *Sharp Beak* as well as hidden *Synthetic Seed* and *Tiny Mushroom*. 

**North Aventurine Woods**

|Old Rod           |%  |Good Rod          |%  |

Finally, head back to Route 1, pick up a Tauros mount (if there are none, go west) and enter 4N once more. Follow the path to the right and go up the ledge here. Grab the *Exp. Candy XL*, *Calm Mint*, *Careful Mint*, and 2 *Lum Berries*. Also you can find hidden *Great Ball* and *Red Shard*. Return to Route 1.

## South Aventurine Woods Exploration

Unfortunately getting everything in the South Aventurine Woods is a bit complicated, to make things easier, we will start at 8S and then go from the left afterwards. From the Vanhanen Labyrinth, enter the first south woods entrance from the right (this will be 8S, using the left-to-right numbering). Note you'll have to dismount to get here. 

Inside, grab the hidden *Revive* then use the Honey tree two times to destroy both of the nearby obstacles. With that out of the way, head all the way to the west, heal if you'd like, then enter 1S on the south side of Route 1.

Grab a hidden *Clever Wing* then go up the ledge and follow the path. Talk to the Honey tree and beat the Pinsir. Down this ledge is 2S, which we can take to emerge onto Route 1. Find a Tauros mount and return to 2S. Up the ledge to the right you'll find a hidden *Max Repel*. Dismount up here, then go down through the patch of tall grass. Use the honey tree and fight Pinsir. Make your way back to Route 1, grab a Tauros, then reenter 2S yet again and go up the right ledge then go down. Once you reach the last ledge, dismount and go down through the tall grass. Use the Honey tree and fight Heracross this time, then return to Route 1. Shocker - grab another Tauros, enter 2S, this time following the path down first. Jump up the ledge at the bottom. Pick up the *Link Stone*, 2 *Sitrus Berries*, and hidden *Magical Seed*. Drop down and go up the ledge immediately to the right, then dismount.

Pick up the hidden *Revive* in the next area, then use the Honey tree and fight Heracross. Exit out of 3S above, get a Tauros mount, and return. Go up the ledge at the bottom, use the Honey tree and fight Pinsir. Grab the hidden *Purple Shard*, and you'll notice we can't progress this way any further. Return to Route 1.

Next, we'll be entering 4S - you'll know you're in the right place if you recognized where we fought Fern. Anyways, lather the Honey tree closest to you and fight Pinsir, then make your way right. Don't go down the ledge to 5S though. Grab hidden *Escape Rope*, *Purple Shard*, and *Potion* then make your way down through the tall grass. At the bottom is another Honey tree, defeat Heracross here. Make your way back up partway through the tall grass and you'll notice an opening. Go that way, and pull out our Floral Charm when prompted to battle **Flabebe**! Head straight to the right and grab the *Oddishweed*. Head back and get lulled into a daze to return to Route 1.

Again, enter 4S, this time, heading down. Use the nearby Honey tree two times to clear both obstacles. Go down and immediately to the right, use another Honey tree and fight Heracross. Finally, head left and down the ledge and use the Honey tree nearest Tanzan and fight Heracross. Follow the path to the left, and you'll emerge at 3S. Get a Tauros mount and reenter 3S, this time, going down and following the newly opened path. At a fork, you'll get *TM51*, 2 *Custap Berries*, and a hidden *Telluric Seed*. Make sure you save one of these Custap Berries for a quest later on.

Follow the path to the right and up. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Star Piece* along the way. Go left at the fork and pick up the *Tech Glasses* as well as a hidden *Repel* and *Link Stone*. Go right from here and grab the hidden *Fire Gem*. Down the ledge you'll finally see why I had us do 8S first... anyways follow the path right then go up. Get the hidden *PP Up* and finally dismount, then head up into the grass. 

Here, you can grab a *Razor Claw* and *TM40 Aerial Ace* as well as hidden *Silver Powder* and *Magical Seed*. You'll also find a Heracross and a Pinsir here. To get **Heracross** defeat the Pinsir, and to get **Pinsir** defeat the Heracross. We'll be able to obtain the other later.

Exit out of 8S, then go left to 7S. You can get a *Water Gem* here and exit on the other side via 6S. That wraps up our exploration of the woods!

Return to the Route 1 Nature Center and talk to the guy on the second floor who lost his specs. In exchange for the Tech Glasses we will get *Department Store Sticker: Heracross*!

With that out of the way, you can use the Tauros shortcut just north of the Grand Gate to make your way to Vanhanen Castle once more.

## Millenium Badge

After talking to the group at the entrance, go up two rooms. Radomus will explain to us the puzzle. Enter the room on the left and grab a *Psychic Memory*. 

Talk to Elias here for more details on the puzzle, etc.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Ask Elias about himself (+1 Elias)

The screen in here will also tell us what our current team chess piece ranks would be in its current ordering, useful for planning for the upcoming fight.

Anyways, it's time to clear all the chess puzzles. I will spoiler the solutions.

> Rook up 7; king up 5, and right 2. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Get the first chess puzzle right on your first try (+1 Radomus)

Move on to the next room. Note that the Bishops must be talked to first from one direction, then you choose its diagonal direction afterwards. So, to go up-left you talk to it from the right then press up, or talk to it from below and press left.

> Knight up 3, and right 3; Rook right 1, up 7, right 1; Bishop up-left 4.

Enter room 3. Luna's trick can help us out here.

> Rightmost Pawn up 1; Second-rightmost Pawn up 6, promote to Knight, down 4, left 6, up 2; Rightmost Knight up 3, left 5, up 2.

Enter room 4. This is a harder one but you can use the trick from the last room to figure it out.

> Pawn up 5, promote to Queen, down 5, right 1; Rightmost Knight left 1, up 2, left 3, up 3, right 3, down 1; Bishop up-left 2, Leftmost Knight up 2.

Head up and into the next room when you are ready for your gym battle.

    - Moonblast

Especially if you've played previous versions, you'll notice that Radomus' team on top of his field is able to get up 8-Turn Trick Room almost always, since his two leads both have it and get a Focus Sash effect as pawns. Malamar will then go for its Contrary Superpower set up while Reuniclus likes to hit insanely hard and go first with Psychic/Rock type boosted Psychic. His Gallade gets attack on switch in, has lots of coverage, and can use a boosted Rock-type Strength, while his Metagross gets free +1 Priority on all of its hard-hitting attacks including Strength and Meteor Mash. Slowking gets defensive boosts upon switch in and can even set up Nasty Plot, and essentially outspeeds everything under Trick Room. Finally, his Gardevoir is EV trained, has a berry, and hits really hard with boosted Psychic but can also set up on you. 

One strategy you can try to use to win is essentially to shut down Trick Room altogether. Using moves like Fake Out will allow you to knock out the Trick Room users on the second turn with super-effective Bug/Dark/Ghost moves, opening you up to exploit the low speeds on everything except Metagross with priority to get an easy sweep. If that isn't working, you can also bring an Oranguru from the forest and use Trick Room yourself to cancel it. Alternatively, Slowking and Reuniclus are the only Pokemon that excel dramatically in Trick Room of this team, so you can just embrace the Trick Room and bring your own super slow team. Knocking out Reuniclus turn one or two will then mean your slower mons will be outspeeding everything except Metagross and maybe Slowking, allowing you to exploit the relatively low defenses of the team barring Gardevoir. 

Your team composition is going to important regardless: you will probably want your leads to be your least bulky mons, especially if they have moves you need to use to get the ball rolling on your strategy like status conditions or hazards. Then, you're going to want your hardest hitting Pokemon to be a King if possible, though without a King's Rock at this point this can be tough to arrange. The rest will essentially fall naturally into Rook/Bishop/Queen - save a bulky attacker for the latter, and consider a Synthetic Seed if you have a special-attacking Bishop. If you happen to have a Pokemon with higher speed than anything else it will become a Knight and can be a great choice to OHKO Gardevoir towards the end. In terms of other Chess-field things: you can use Strength/Secret Power yourself for a field boost if you wish; these moves will shoot through the roof in power if you can confuse your opponents. You also get a boost when using Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, which you can use to ignore Trick Room speeds and steal some KO's against his Psychic types. Defensively, you can use Pokemon with Adaptability, Telepathy, Anticipation, or Synchronize to eat Radomus' Psychic and Strength attacks. Finally, you could also consider using Stomping Tantrum to cancel out the field altogether if you need to.

Once you win, you'll get the *Millenium Badge* which pushes our cap up to Lv. 65 as well as *TM92 Trick Room*. Finally we have pretty much the best TM in the game!

# Episode 11: Out of Light

After everything goes dark, head out of the gym. Once you get outside, use the Light Shard since your team will probably be pretty crippled. Head out into the labyrinth. One of the meteor grunts is Radomus in disguise and will allow you to escape via walking on top of the hedges. Make your way out of the labyrinth, hop on the circling Tauros to skip to the other side of Route 1, then enter Reborn City.

## Seventh Street

Talk to your gang leader, and they will tell you about Seventh Street. To reach it with Aqua Gang, use the top left house in Lapis, with Magma Gang, use a house on the left in the center of Lapis. 

Wander around the area and defeat all the trainers. Hidden around the map you'll find 2 *Purple Shards*, *Common Candy*, 2 *Blue Shards*, 2 *Green Shards*, *Pecha Berry*, *X Sp. Atk*, 2 *Red Shards*, and *Calcium*. The house in the middle of the top contains a healing point and PC. Talk to all of the NPC's in the area and you'll learn about what you can get down here in 7th.

Towards the top of the map you'll find an *Ability Capsule* salesperson. They'll trade you first 1, then 2, then 3 from then on of a random color of shard. Useful. Up and to the right we'll find a couple of tutors.

Grab a Soul Candle for a quest later on, and a Stick for a different quest later on.

To the right, you'll see one of your gang members making a sale:

**Seventh Street Blast Powder Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Blast Powder* |$2000  |

Blast Powder will essentially let us mine all the mining rocks a second time. Buy at least 5 for now since there are a few things actually gated behind the mining rocks we'll want to grab, but getting more won't hurt. For what it's worth, saving in front of a rock until you find a Star Piece or Rare Bone in the rubble you can guarantee a return on investment for these things.

Enter the cage area in the bottom right corner. Here, a guy will be selling all of the Pokemon we previously worked with in the Blacksteam Meteor Factory. 

**Seventh Street Pokemon Seller**

|Pokemon        |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|Vanillite      |3 Purple Shards|
|Loudred        |5 Blue Shards  |
|**Roggenrola** |3 Red Shards   |
|**Abra**       |8 Purple Shards|
|**Lickitung**  |7 Blue Shards  |
|Makuhita       |3 Green Shards |
|**Jigglypuff** |5 Green Shards |
|**Cyndaquil**  |9 Red Shards   |

Something important to note is there is a sidequest later that will involve returning Vanillite, Loudred, Roggenrola, Lickitung, and Makuhita to their original owners, so I recommend breeding them if you want to use them, and keeping the originals somewhere in your PC. The reward is really, really good, so keep that in mind. The rest you can train up as you wish.

If you've been picking up all the hidden shards I've pointed out and have been mining most of the rocks, getting every Pokemon should be no problem at this point. Shards will pretty much from now on only be useful for unlocking future tutors and buying Ability Capsules and a few other small things.

For one, if you've kept up so far with the sidequest involving that Pokemon stolen from us in the Grand Hall, all the way back in the first part, you can now continue that quest. For just 2 Blue Shards, you can buy back your Pokemon... just kidding, it gets stolen again. Sigh.

Anyways, exit this area. Once you buy all of the Pokemon, DJ Arclight will give you a *Lucky Egg*. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Buy all of the seventh street stolen Pokemon (+1 Arclight)

The house above is the Pokemon Psychologist. For just two Heart Scales (which we can find in rocks everywhere) we can change the nature of a Pokemon to whatever we want! Don't need to rely on finding mints anymore, which is really nice.

Enter the nearby grotto. Note that there is a sneaky hidden item behind a trainer on the left, make sure you draw him out at least 1 tile when he notices you in order to get it. Anyways, hidden in this room is *Black Glasses*, *Red Shard*, and *Exp. Candy XL*. 

North of the top tutors, you'll see a shadow indicating an entrance. Inside, talk to the green machine to get a *Synthetic Seed*. Defeat the researcher in here and agree to participate in her sidequest.

First, you'll need to bring her a Carvanha. Note that these will be gone forever. We can fish one in the nearby Lapis Alleyway. Next, you'll need an Unfezant. You can get Tranquill on the Onyx Rooftop: evolve it at Lv. 31 to get **Unfezant**, then donate it. Finally, we'll need Luxray. You can get Shinx in the Game Corner, evolve it at Lv. 15 then again at Lv. 30 to get **Luxio** then **Luxray**. Donate the latter. Exit Seventh to Lapis Ward, then come back down. Save the game and talk to Nadira. You'll be able to catch **Type: Null**, our first legendary!

On the north side of the main part of seventh, talk to your gang member and he'll mention seeing Bennett in the watering hole. Enter the watering hole, heal if you want, then head out and into the grotto on the right. Grab the hidden *Blue Shard* then talk to Bennett here.

Back outside, a door will be open above you. Head up and to the right. You'll find a mining rock - break it and then use Blast Powder, then pick up the hidden *'Rare Candy'*. Head back to Seventh and it will be stolen! Head all the way to the bottom left of the area and you'll find the thief. Battle him to get it back. Enter the top grotto and give it to a guy to obtain **Piplup**!

Reenter the narrow hole in the wall. You can find hidden *Purple Shard* and *Chewing Gum* as you go left. Enter the room in the bottom left!

## Subseven Sanctum

You'll be moved to a cage. Read the green book here - in fact, every green book you see around this dungeon. Keep note of what the scripture says as well as the numbers at the end.

Head out once Klefki opens the door. Welcome to Reborn's stealth section. I recommend saving often and if you get caught just reloading - save yourself the time. You might also want to turn off speed-up. Head right and go up the second from right passage, then go right and into the open door. Read these books and grab the *Spell Tag* and *Holy Field Readout*. 

Back outside, sneak past the nearby guard by going up at the right time, then go left when you can. You'll notice you can't go too far left, so you'll need to time going down past a patrolling guard, then once he passes you, go up, left, and down so he can't see you anymore. From here, head left once he moves back to the right, but don't go too far left. You'll next need to go down, left, down, then left once more. Time going up along the left wall, then take the first right. 

You'll need to go up here, but you can't see the full body of the guard above. This might take a couple of resets, but you'll need to perfectly time going up and then left based on whether you are seeing the front or back of the legs of the sprite. Yeah. Once you succeed, you'll need to loop around and repeat to go up from the guard. Head up and right and go up the stairs - the guards will all leave, so you can now navigate this room as you like without getting caught.

In the next room, you'll need to defeat grunts around the room and interact with 4 statues and input numbers that correspond to the respective scriptures. Solutions:

> Green: 3827, Purple: 0204, Red: 2303, Blue: 1605

Once the door is opened towards the middle, prepare for a battle and head up.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Ace Loyalty (+1 Ace, -1 Elias)
- Tell Ace Blood (+1 Elias, -1 Ace)

Back outside in the Beryl Wall, another conversation will occur.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Luna you are afraid of the dark (-1 Luna)
- Tell Luna you aren't afraid of the dark after siding with El (Neutral)
- Tell Luna you aren't afraid of the dark after siding with Radomus (+1 Luna)
 
You'll then get the *Red Crystal Key*! Don't accept Cain's fast travel request - we can finish a few things up down in Seventh, plus getting to Vanhanen Labyrinth is now easy thanks to the circling Tauros.

## A Cult and a Gang: Sidequests

Ok, so there are a few sidequests we can take care of in and around Seventh. First, head right back into the Subseven Sanctum and talk to the pentagram thing. With a Soul Candle in our bag, we'll be able to catch **Litwick**. 

Back in seventh, the house in the bottom left corner will now be unlocked. If you have a Helix Fossil and do not have a Dome Fossil in your bag, the Twitch Plays Pokemon cultist will ask us to bring a Farfetch'd to him. Do so, and you'll get a choice between the *Sail Fossil* and the *Jaw Fossil*. Since we already have Amaura, no point in getting the former, so pick up the Jaw.

Back outside, if you haven't already seen the scene, walk south from the psychologist towards the Pokemon sellers to see Madame Craudberry storm off, and your gang leader telling you to meet at her house in Lapis, so do so.

**Harridan Craudburry. Field: No Field**

    - Hammer Arm
    - Slack Off
    - Frustration
    - Night Slash

If this was a normal Pokemon game, this fight would be pretty hard relative to the others. However this is Pokemon Reborn: her team doesn't even have much synergy. No field, no weather, nothing. Just 5 annoying but beatable EV trained Pokemon - should be nothing for you at this point. You can exploit Slaking's Truant with Protect to set up or something if you need to.

### The Magma Gang Route Part 3

As usual, if you are in the Aqua Gang, skip ahead to the next section.

Head outside, and talk to Maxwell. He will give us *TM11 Sunny Day*. Return to Seventh Street and enter the bottom grotto. Inside, you'll find Archer who you can battle!

**Aqua Mastermind Archer. Field: No Field**
- Pelipper, Lv. 58, Ability: Drizzle, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Hydro Pump
    - Hurricane
    - Roost
    - Tailwind

    - Ice Beam

    - Aqua Jet
    - Crunch
    - Earthquake
    - Ice Fang

Archer uses his rain team once more, but you'll notice it's not really optimized. His Pelipper is the only mechanism to summon rain, and the rest of his Pokemon have no rain-boosted abilities. So it's really just a weak Water-monotype team that you should be able to deal with. Sharpedo can be deadly with Speed Boost and priority but everything else is slow enough that you can figure this one out, I'm sure.

For winning, you'll get *TM18 Rain Dance*. 

You'll also notice that since Maxwell is gone from the North Obsidia Ward, you can now grab the hidden *X Attack* behind him and get another Houndour.

### The Aqua Gang Route Part 3

As usual, if you are in the Magma Gang, skip ahead to the next section.

Head outside, and talk to Archer. He will give us *TM18 Rain Dance*. Return to Seventh Street and enter the bottom grotto. Inside, you'll find Maxwell who you can battle!

    - Nasty Plot
    - Flamethrower
    - Dark Pulse
    - Sludge Bomb

Maxwell uses his sun team once more, but you'll notice it's not really optimized. His Ninetales is the only mechanism to summon sun, and the rest of his Pokemon have no sun-boosted abilities past Charizard. So it's really just a weak Fire-monotype team that you should be able to deal with once the sun is gone. Houndoom and Charizard can hit pretty hard but exploiting the team's many weaknesses shouldn't be too tough.

For winning, you'll get *TM11 Sunny Day*. 

## Iolia Valley

Head over to Vanhanen Labyrinth. Hidden behind the big tree in the top right is the entrance to Iolia Valley. Talk to the red gem to create a rock smash wall. Head through the path.

**Iolia Valley**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |

|                  |   |**Alomomola**     |20 |

In this first area you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Awakening*, and *Blue Shard*. In the bottom left, use the red key once more to open a rock smash wall, then go inside the new cave. 

**Iolia Valley Caves**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Graveler-Alola    |30 |

|**Carbink**       |19 |
|**Swoobat**       |10 |
|**Bronzong**      |1  |

Exit at the bottom. In the next area, grab the hidden *Purple Shard* then make a new cave entrance. Finally, grab the hidden *Green Shard* and pick up the *Green Crystal Key*.

Make your way all the way back to the entrance of the valley. On the second tier you'll see a glowing green crystal which we can now activate to turn hedges into Rock Smash gems. Sometimes when you smash these, you'll get *Green Shards*.

Go down from here and use the red key to open a new door. Past the cave you can find a hidden *Red Shard* and the *Blue Crystal Key*. 

Once again return to the center of the valley. Talk to the glowing blue crystal by the water to activate it and make an ice bridge.

On the other side of the water, go up first, then follow the path, using your keys. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Blue Shard* along the way. Activate the green crystal at the end, then return to the ice bridge and go down. Along this path, grab the hidden *Green Shard* and *Magical Seed*. Once you enter your newly created cave entrance, Bennett will confront you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett you will let him do what he has to (+1 Bennett)
- Tell Bennett you will not let him do what he has to (-1 Bennett)

Grab the *Purple Crystal Key*! Talk to the nearby purple crystal to mutate the cave. Outside the new exit, you can get a hidden *Red-Hots* and *X. Sp Atk*. In the next red cave, use the crystal to mutate another cave. Return all the way to the northmost ice bridge.

Head up from here and enter the cave. Mutate this cave with the purple crystal, then head out the new exit. Pick up the hidden red shard and enter the red cave at the top. Inside, grab the *Dark Memory* and the *Dark Crystal Cavern Field Readout*. If you have Dark Pulse or Night Daze on one of your Pokemon, there is one more thing we can do here. Use it in a wild encounter to transform the Crystal Cavern to a Dark Crystal Cavern to get Sableye. Note that we'll get the former as a TM pretty soon, so you can do this part later if you wish.

**Iolia Valley Northeast Dark Cave**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Sableye**       |100|

Back outside, make your way to the entrance to the valley once more. Enter the cave on the second tier, and activate the purple crystal to mutate it. Head back out and enter the cave on the first tier, and head out the newly formed exit. You'll find a *Dusk Stone* and a hidden *Rawst Berry*. 

To progress, return to the entrance, un-mutate the cave we just mutated, then go through the original cave once more. Following the cave to where we got the green key, we'll see a Light Shard. Use it, then create another red cave entrance and go in.

Poor guy couldn't even level his Larvesta up once more to have Volcarona. Once more, he benefits from the field he's on, this time, in the form of boosted Signal Beams. But again his bugs are fairly frail and have lots of exploitable weaknesses, so you should be able to figure this one out.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Bennett on your first try (+1 Luna, -2 Bennett)

With that, we could challenge Luna. There are actually a few things we can do now that we have a few blast powders and the crystal keys. Skip ahead if you just wanna do the fight now.

## Blast Powder and Crystal Key Goodies

There should now be a purple warp in Luna's room that will take us to the entrance of Iolia Valley. Convenient! 

Head out of Iolia Valley and make your way through South Aventurine Woods to the Tanzan Mountain. Go right when you can into the room that Saphira burst out of earlier. You can use the green key to open a new pathway.

Hop across some sneaky ledges onto the rocky texture of the cave, then make your way down and to the right. Exit onto the Chrysolia Pass.

Pick up a hidden *Hyper Potion* and *Normal Gem* as you make your way south. In the next rooms, move boulders out of the way and grab the *Escape Rope*. The next room is a bit harder: you'll need to carefully move boulders and touch all three of the canisters to turn them red without getting stuck. If you need to, you can exit the room as you try to solve this one.

Once you succeed, exit through the newly opened door. Head down the nearby ladder: this next puzzle will involve pushing boulders down holes to break rocks, and going up ladders. To go up, use the ladders on the left side of the area. 

Once you finish this puzzle and emerge on top of the wall, head left to get the *Inverse Field Readout*. Right from here, there is a hidden cave entrance behind the canister. Inside, you can get the *Toxic Orb* and *Yureyu Key*. You can also talk to the canister here to get **Dhelmise**. Exit all the way out how you came in. 

While we're nearby, head over to Spinel Town. We can revive the Jaw Fossil we got earlier to obtain **Tyrunt**!

The next two have a very high trip-taken to value-of-reward ratio... but for completeness I'll get 'em anyways. Our next destination is Byxbysion Wasteland itself. Using the tunnels, make your way all the way back to the room where we fought Mr. Bigglesworth once upon a time. You can use your Blast Powder to access a *Dawn Stone*.

While on the subject of long trips just to use Blast Powder for single items, take the boat to Apophyll Beach and enter Apophyll Cave. On the left side you can now use the powder to access a hidden *Max Revive*.

Ok, with those out of the way, head to the Underroot in Beryl. You'll see a green crystal on the right side of the area, so activate it. Cutting some wiggly trees here will allow us to get the *Ampharosite* as well as the *Meadow Plate* and an **Axew** egg. Sweet.

Head over to the Yureyu Abandoned Power Plant where we once fought Shade. Head to the right and around to the top, then use the Yureyu Key to get the *Magnet* and the *Ghostium-Z*. Sweet. Next, head around to the other side of the factory and again use the Yureyu Key to get inside. 

**Yureyu Power Plant (Backroom)**

|**Cofagrigus**    |5  |
|**Dusclops**      |4  |
|**Klinklang**     |1  |

Each of the Poke Balls in this room is an Electrode. Defeat all of them then talk to the monitor at the top for a battle with **Rotom**. 

While we're in the Beryl area, head over to the Beryl Cemetery. If you talked to Simon in the Tanzan Meteor Base, you'll see him here. Talk to him to continue his sidequest - then head down to the building to the right of the Peridot Ward Pokemart to talk to him once more. That's all we can do with this quest for now.

## Eclipse Badge

Return to the Iolia Valley and take the warp to Luna's room.

    - Double Team
    - Toxic

Time to fight Reborn's Dark type gym leader. Her field will boost the power of Dark Pulse and Night Slash by 1.5x, not surprising for a Reborn gym fight really. What is more notable is that the field boosts the defenses of Dark types by 1.5x, so what'd normally be straightforward super-effective kills on Bisharp, Tyranitar, Absol, Weavile, and Honchkrow now aren't so certain, and the latter three can even stack attack on you and hit with wide coverage. Not to mention the already very bulky Umbreon, who now is even more bulky and can heal 75% of its health with Moonlight and also boost its Evasion. Plus, they all have perfect IV's and are all EV trained, a feature we'll see sticking around with the boss fights. Anyways, Luna is a pretty straightforward albeit tough fight that uses offensive and defensive boosts provided by the field pretty well.

The good news is that by this point you should have lots of options to deal with the team. If you want to stay with the Dark Crystal Cavern field, you can use Aurora Veil without Hail or use your own Dark types to get the defense boosts. Dazzling Gleam and Signal Beam get boosted on this field, effectively cancelling out the defenses boost of her team if you use these moves. If you can get around Honchkrow, Fighting types and Bug types with high attack can generally succeed here too in spite of the added defense. You can also take advantage of the fact that she has a singular special move on her entire team and bring a team with lots of Defense to go blow-for-blow. 

There are also merits to changing the field. For one, simply by setting sun you'll switch the field to Crystal Cavern, a field which is more neutral and lets you use Dragon-type moves more effectively if you'd like. Alternatively you can use one of the Earthquake-esque moves to switch over to a Cave Field, allowing you to ignore their bulk and nuke the opponents with more uses of the Earthquake-esque moves and profit from boosted Rock-type moves as well as boosted Hyper Voice and Boomburst. In either case Tyranitar will still be a menace, but past Bisharp she has no Rock-resists. 

Once you succeed, you'll get the *Eclipse Badge* which boosts our cap to Lv. 70, coincidentally about the point where normal Pokemon games just... end. Plus, she'll give us *TM97 Dark Pulse*! Nice.

# Episode 12: Demarcation

Exit Luna's gym. **If you head up to the Agate City entrance and go through, we'll actually be locked out from coming back to every area we've been to so far for about 4 badges worth of content.** Before we do so, there are a few sidequests and stuff to grab before continuing.

## 9 Badge Quests

Thanks to the Dark Pulse TM, you can now transform the field in the cave on the eastern side of Iolia Valley to get Sableye a bit easier, so take care of that if you'd like.

Next, make your way to Seventh Street. In the middle of the area you'll see a woman pleading for some medicine for her sleeping husband. Give her the Oddishweed we found earlier in exchange for an egg which will hatch to be **Chespin**.

With that out of the way, if you'd like, take some time to prepare for the next section of the game. Notably we won't have access to the Department Store, most of the Pokemon we've seen so far, or the Daycare, so stock up on items and do all the breeding and catching you want.

Once you're all set, make your way to the Agate City checkpoint north of the Vanhanen Labyrinth, talk to Cain, then head out at the top.

## Agate Circus

After our first introduction to Terra... we get to explore the Agate Circus! This area will serve as our "home base" of sorts for the next few badges. There are trainers scattered about as well as a healing component in the bottom of the area.

Hidden around the circus, you'll find 3 *Blue Shards*, *Oran Berry*, *Red Shard*, *Full Heal*, *Ultra Potion*, *Escape Rope*, *Purple Shard*, and 2 *Green Shards*.

Starting at the entrance we came in through and working vaguely clockwise, there are tons of things to buy, minigames, etc.

**Agate Circus Cotton Candy Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Cotton Candy* |$5000  |

**Agate Circus General Goods Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Ultra Ball*   |$1200  |
|*Super Repel*  |$700   |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550   |
|*Full Heal*    |$600   |
|*Hyper Potion* |$1000  |
|*Eviolite*     |$20000 |

We can finally buy Ultra Balls! Although it's expensive, the Eviolite can turn certain Pokemon like Porygon 2 and Dusclops into monsters for this part of the game.

**Agate Circus Pledge Move Tutor**

|Move           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|Grass Pledge   |3 Green Shards |
|Fire Pledge    |3 Red Shards   |
|Water Pledge   |3 Blue Shards  |

We had access to this in Lapis, but here's one for this section of the game if you need it. There's a Move Relearner in the bottom right corner, again doing it for one Heart Scale per move.

**Agate Circus Friendship Berries**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Pomeg Berry*  |$500           |
|*Kelpsy Berry* |$500           |
|*Qualot Berry* |$500           |
|*Tamato Berry* |$500           |
|*Hondew Berry* |$500           |
|*Grepa Berry*  |$500           |

Just in case you need some. 

To the left is a tile puzzle, which you can play in exchange for 1 Green Shard. This is the solution:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/carracosta.jpg"/>

Winning will reward you a *Cover Fossil*. To the left is another person selling *Ability Capsules* in exchange for 1, then 2, then 3 of (a) random color shard(s). 

**Agate Circus Balloon Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Air Balloon*  |$400   |

Next, you'll find an NPC who will change your Pokemon's Hidden Power type in exchange for a Heart Scale. Would've really been useful in the mainline Pokemon games, but at least Reborn isn't lame. Past her is a nickname changer, also obsolete thanks to the party menu.

To the left is another tile puzzle, which you can play in exchange for 1 Red Shard. This is the solution:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/archeops.jpg"/>

Winning will reward you a *Plume Fossil*. Up from here are some tutors.

**Agate Circus Move Tutor Bottom** 

|Move               |Price          |
|-------------------|---------------|
|Uproar             |3 Blue Shards  |
|Hyper Voice        |5 Green Shards |
|Stomping Tantrum   |4 Purple Shards|
|Low Kick           |6 Red Shards   |

**Agate Circus Move Tutor Top**

|Move               |Price          |
|-------------------|---------------|
|Iron Tail          |4 Blue Shards  |
|Focus Punch        |3 Green Shards |
|Drill Run          |4 Purple Shards|
|Synthesis          |3 Red Shards   |

Down from here there are more stores and such.

**Agate Circus Snax Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*PokeSnax*     |$650   |

**Agate Circus Ice Cream Shop**

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$600       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$800       |
|*Blue Moon Ice Cream*\*|$20000     |

The Blue Moon Ice Cream shows up rarely with the same mechanics as before.

There is another tile puzzle here, but this one has different mechanics. I recommend saving beforehand so if you get stuck you don't have to waste a shard when you reset. It costs 1 Purple Shard. Anyways, the finished puzzle looks like this:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/conkeldurr.jpg"/>

Once you win, you'll get a **Timburr**!

Next to this you'll find the High Striker. It costs $350 to play each time. 

**High Striker Rewards**

|Reward         |Chance |
|---------------|-------|
|*TM87 Swagger* |2%     |
|**Clefairy**   |14%    |
|Money back     |22%    |
|Nothing        |62%    |

After you've gotten the grand prize, from then on it will be replaced with getting your money back and winning a *Poke Doll*. After getting Clefairy, you will win an actual *Poke Doll* from then on. There's a secret here too: if you do this with a pokemon with Huge Power, Guts, Pure Power, or Sheer Force at the front of your party, you will always get the jackpot!

Once you get a Poke Doll, give it to a child below the healing component to get the *Big Top Arena Field Readout*. 

**Agate Circus Power Items Shop**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Power Weight* |$15000         |
|*Power Bracer* |$15000         |
|*Power Belt*   |$15000         |
|*Power Anklet* |$15000         |
|*Power Lens*   |$15000         |
|*Power Band*   |$15000         |

The colorful clown in the upper-right part of the area is Clown Indra. We can fight him over and over again - he will battle us with a random team. Upon winning, we will get 8 *Exp. Candy L* and a randomly colored *Shard*. Just in case you needed more.

Enter the gate on the right side that we came in from. Upstairs, a girl will take four Shoal Salts and four Shoal Shells and make us a *Shell Bell*! To her right, there is a clown who gives us a riddle. Solving the riddle is a request for an in-game trade: our Stunfisk for his **Vulpix**!

Back outside, talk to the ringmaster in the upper left corner. Make your way to the cotton candy vendor to get a *Cotton Candy* for free.

Finally, talk to Samson next to the high striker. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Samson as he clears the way, when the player is female (+1 Samson)

Head in to the Big Top, and talk to Aya on the couch. After a conversation you'll get the *Powder Vial*.

Head out then come back in to have some conversations for relationship points if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Aya (+1 Aya)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Cain (+1 Aya)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Ciel (+2 Samson, -1 Ciel)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Samson (+2 Ciel, -1 Samson)

Exit the Big Top. You'll notice another tutor on the left side of the circus.

**Agate Circus Fake Samson Move Tutor**

|Move               |Price          |
|-------------------|---------------|
|Dual Chop          |4 Blue Shards  |
|Thunder Punch      |5 Green Shards |
|Fire Punch         |5 Purple Shards|
|Ice Punch          |6 Red Shards   |

Make your way to the bottom left of the circus, grab the hidden *Fighting Gem*, and go in. Inside, a child will ask for a *Cotton Candy*. Once we give it to them, they will ask for a *Air Balloon*. Once you give all the items to the kid their scheme will be revealed, and we will get *Department Store Sticker: Clefairy*. 

## Route 2

Head up the elevator and walk outside.

**Route 2**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |

If you go up from here you'll find a hidden *Telluric Seed*, but can't progress farther. So, we'll have to jump over some rocks to the left. Using the cliff and the rocks, you can hop any two-tile-length gaps. Head up once you're in the northern area. You'll notice a green tree and a red tree. The green trees drop Sleep Powder and the red trees drop Rage Powder, both of which can be contained in the Powder Vial. The former can be used to put Crustle to sleep while the latter will wake them up and allow us to battle them! Note that if you hop onto a rock with a narrow base of support, the powder will spill out. 

Grab some sleep powder and talk to the rock towards the top to summon a Crustle. Talk to it to put it to sleep, then push it to the right side so that it falls into the hole. A precise guide to moving this first Crustle:

> Right 3, Up 1, Right 4, Up 2, Right 3, Up 1, Right 5, Down 2, Right 3

Grab some more sleep powder then head to the bottom right corner of this level. You'll find a rock that lets us climb up, so do so. Hop left then immediately down onto a cliffside. To the left from here you'll find a hidden *Link Stone*. Back near the stairs, make your way to the top left side of this area, carefully avoiding the wobbly rocks. On the higher platform, talk to the rock to summon a Crustle, then push it into the hole at the top of this area. Precisely:

> Left 4, Up 8, Right 1, Up 4, Right 1, Up 3

Make your way back down to the larger area, get another dose of sleep powder, then return to the upper left area.

Climb onto the white rock via the stairs then go right for a hidden *Ability Capsule*. Go to the left and use the cliff to hop over to the rock face up and to the right. Use the sleep powder on the Crustle in the nearby rock, then push this crustle off the ledge to the right. This is a bit of a tricky maneuver - keep in mind that you can hop your way around to get a better angle. Precisely:

> Left 2, go up the stairs, hop down, and go down ledges to loop around to get on top of Crustle, Down 1, take the stairs to the left up, hop down, and hop your way to the rightmost stairs, Right 3, Down 1. 

From here, climb the stairs and make your way down the first ledge on the gray rock face and hop to the right onto the rock with stairs.  You'll need to finish moving the Crustle we previously knocked down the cliff into the hole at the top. Precisely:

> Right 2, Down 1, Right 2, Up 3, Left 1, Up all the way

Climb up the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Green Shard*, and be able to hop across Crustle to go left at the top. Pick up *TM58 Sky Drop* and a hidden *Super Potion*. To the left across the final Crustle you can get a hidden *Ether* and *Purple Shard*. Head into the mountain here.

Without Surf we can't really do much here other than catch some Water and Ice-type Pokemon, so head back out onto Route 2. 

Make your way back to the platform with the trees, and get onto the stairs in the bottom right corner. Hop your way onto the platform containing a hiker and pick up the hidden *Guard Spec.* and *Full Heal*. Climb the stairs, beat the clown, and pick up another hidden *Guard Spec.*

Down the nearby stairs you can walk through the valley between the rocks to climb the stairs in the bottom right corner. Up from here, talk to the locked gate on the right side to open up this shortcut!

To the right from here, go down and grab hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *Revive*. Can't go further, so head back and go all the way left. Grab a hidden *Telluric Seed*, beat the clown, and grab a hidden *Red Shard* and go down the stairs. Again we will be blocked, so go back up and right then go down the stairs.

Grab a hidden *Ultra Ball* then hop across some rocks to the right to grab a *Exp. Candy XL*. Next, hop to the left from the cliff at the top, grab a hidden *PokeSnax*, and hop your way to the bottom right side of the area. Climb down the stairs. 

Snag the *Blue Shard* to the left, then get some sleep poweer and talk to Crustle. We'll need to move it down and right. Precisely: 

> Left 2, Down 1, Right 2, Down 5, Right 3, Down 1, Right 3

Down from here, you can hop onto some reddish rocks. Hop down and to the right to pick up the *Rocky Field Readout*. Head back up to the higher platform, go up the stairs, and hop your way left to where the ranger is. Go down the stairs here, then pick up a hidden *Red Shard* in this lower area.

Grab some sleep powder and put the Crustle in the bottom right corner to sleep. We'll need to push it off a cliff down and to the left. Precisely: 

> Left 4, Down 4, Left 2, Down 4, Left 1, Down 6, Right 1, Down 8

Take the nearby stairs and take the path up and left. Get more sleep powder then push Crustle. We'll need to get it off of two cliffs. Precisely:

> Left 5, Down 1 off the cliff, Left 4, Down 2, Right 2, Down 1

Grab the hidden *Swift Wing, Big Mushroom, Fire Stone*, and *Paralyze Heal* then return to the rock stairs down and right.

Hop to the right this time, taking a stop on the narrow cliffside to the right. Use the sleep powder on the Crustle and push it off the cliff at the bottom. Precisely: 

> Left 2, Down 5, Right 1, Down 6

Pick up the hidden *Red Shard* then continue the rock hop up and around to the right. Grab a hidden *Ground Gem*. The path to the right, including a Crustle from earlier, will take us to the start of Route 2, a helpful shortcut. Go down the stairs from here and beat the hiker.

Jump over the placed Crustle and move the remaining one off the cliff and into its final destination. Precisely: 

> Left 2, Down 2, Right 1, Down 4 off the cliff, Left 5, Up 5, Right 1, Up 1.

Grab the hidden *Super Repel* then hop over the Crustles to get to the left. Grab the hidden *Flying Gem*.

In this area, you'll find hidden *Carbos*, *Great Ball*, *Burn Heal*, *Potion*, *X Defend*, *Iron*, *PokeSnax*, *X Sp. Def*, *Revive*, *Escape Rope*, and *Stardust*.

Head into the Fiore Mansion at the top and talk to Amaria. Head upstairs and talk to Hardy on the couch.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- If you saw Titania on Route 1, tell her you'll keep the secret (+1 Titania)
- If you saw Titania on Route 1, tell her you won't keep the secret (-1 Titania)

Head outside, and you can grab the *Water Surface Field Readout*. 

Back downstairs, you'll be given the *Battle Pass - Strike*. With that out of the way, head on back to the circus.

Ooh boy, time for Samson. When I first played Reborn I was stuck on this fight for weeks! For one, 10 of his 24 moves are "high-striker" moves, meaning they get multiplied by a random multiplier between 0.5x and 3x. Only, his Hariyama and Conkeldurr are guaranteed high rolls due to their ability, and any Pokemon with increased attack also has a better chance at high rolls, meaning Synthetic Seed Hawlucha and Blaziken as well as Swords Dance Lucario can all get really high rolls! Essentially this means that most of the time you get hit by a high striker move you are going to be absolutely bodied! On top of this, Lucario's Swords Dance does 3 stages per use, and his Acrobatics will hit with 165 base power regardless of item held! With Conkeldurr sitting at 90 speed and Hawlucha literally outspeeding every single Pokemon I know of that you can have once it gets its Unburden boost, his team is well suited to deal with all kinds of speed set ups and easily crush your puny Pokemon with high striker moves. Thanks to Brick Break, your puny screens will be crushed as well. All in all a tough fight!

Ok, so Samson crushed me when I was younger, but that was before I read the field notes for Big Top Arena and realized how much you can do back to him! Compared to some of the simpler fields, Big Top Arena is really broad and opens up a ton of strategies you can use against this guy. If nothing else, notice that what I mentioned about Acrobatics earlier holds true for you as well - the move pretty much wipes his whole team if you can survive long enough to use it. It is also the move you get from using Nature Power on this field, allowing even more Pokemon to use this strategy. You can also use the High Striker moves yourself to hit hard if you want - notable users include Guts Medicham, Guts / Sheer Force Conkeldurr, and Sky Drop Sheer Force Braviary. There are also a ton of moves that are boosted on this field otherwise: sound moves like Hyper Voice and Boomburst, and other moves like Petal Dance, Power Whip, Fly, and Revelation Dance, to name a few. Speaking of the latter, a Pokemon with Dancer gets +1 Spe and +1 SpA whenever they use a dancing move... meaning Oricorio can actually fairly easily sweep him with a bit of support. If you are able to cripple his Pokemon long enough to boost yourself, Swords Dance, Dragon Dance, and Quiver Dance are all boosted, meaning you can get your own sweeper going fairly easily. Rain lasts 8 turns, Sing has perfect accuracy now, Belly Drum grants defense boosts... there are just so many options that you can use on this field! Even if you don't want to abuse the field, fast Psychic and Flying types are still solid choices to deal with his slower team members and you can always use something like Sturdy + Counter for the tricky ones if need be. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Samson on your first try (+2 Ciel)
- Defeat Samson on your second, third, etc. try (-1 Ciel)

Once you win, you'll get the *Strike Badge* and *TM31 Brick Break*.

# Episode 13: Cascade

With 10 badges in hand, return to the Celestinine Cascade and talk to Titania inside. You'll get *TMX3 Surf*! Finally.

**Relationship Point Choices:**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Amaria that Titania is wrong (+2 Amaria, -2 Titania)

## Mountain Range Surfin'

We can't follow them down the waterfall, but we can now explore with Surf! One quick note:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Read Titania's diary once she is down the cascade (-1 Titania)

I'll start by exploring the rest of the area we are currently in, the Celestinine Cascade.

🅱️indra. Once you win against his Rainbow team you will get a *Full Heal*! Talk to him again and say yes! Then again and say no! Finally he will give you *TM39 Rock Tomb*. 

Head up to enter Citrine Mountain! We've actually been in this mountain once before, but from a different side.

Hidden on this floor you'll find 7 *Shoal Salts*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Potion*, *Revive*, *Normal Gem*, and *Heart Scale*, though the latter requires use of a Blast Powder.

On the top there is a ladder that will take us to the familiar 2F. Up here you'll find a hidden *Zinc*, and *Ultra Ball* but that's about it. Back on 1F, surf to the upper right corner to enter Celestinine Mountain 1F.

Hidden on this map are a *Super Potion*, and a *Full Heal*. Cross the ice to to the top right, and surf to the right and grab a hidden *Ultra Ball*. The bottom of this map will lead you out to the cascade we saw earlier. Without Dive and Waterfall there isn't much to do in here, so go up the ladder in the top right corner.

Cross the ice puzzle to get to the left. Precisely: 
> Up, Left, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Left to go from the right side to the left side
> Right, Down, Left, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up, Right, Down to go from the left side to the right side

Follow the body of water up from here to enter Ametrine Mountain 2F.

You'll eventually notice on the right the area we once came in via Route 2. Now you know how all three of these mountains are connected to each other and the greater Route 2 area! We're actually going to take a quick detour back to the circus while we're so close to it.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Blake at the bottom of the circus (+1 Blake)

There's also a Pokemon and a few items we can get right now using Surf, albeit in a bit of an odd way. You can get them later with Rock Climb super easily, but I figured I should cover it now. Head back to Route 2, and grab some rage powder. Enter Ametrine Mountain 2F, then make your way all the way backwards and exit out of Celestinine Mountain into the cascade. Go to the right and use the powder on the first Crustle you see. 

Inside this cave you can get an *Elemental Seed* as well as the *Aerodactylite* and a hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. You can also talk to the rock at the top to battle **Salandit**!

Unfortunately this makes it impossible to go from Celestinine Cascade to the other side of Route 2 for now. If you want to reopen this shortcut, you'll need to head back through the mountain onto Route 2 to move another Crustle into that place. 

Anyways, return to Ametrine 2F, surf to the left, and cross the simple ice puzzle. Talk to Aya near the iceberg. After this scene, follow the path up and right to emerge onto Route 3.

...So much for entering Calcenon City. Make your way right, picking up hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Green Shard* along the way. Aya will join us as a partner!

**Relationship Point Choices:**

Exit the door at the bottom. Outside, you can find a hidden *Max Elixir*, *Resist Wing*, and *Exp. Candy XL*. 

Enter the next cave. Inside you can find hidden *PokeSnax*, and *Potion*, as well as Team Meteor! Beyond you can find a hidden *Max Potion* and *Tiny Mushroom*. In the next room, use the panel and follow the path.

In this room, you can get hidden *Repeat Ball*, *Fire Gem*, and *Great Ball*. The next room contains a hidden *Super Repel* and *Poke Ball*. 

Head outside and go right. Pick up a hidden *X Defend* along the way. Right before the hop rocks you can get a hidden *Green Shard*. Hop down and enter the next cave.

In here, you can get a hidden *Blast Powder*, *Ultra Potion*, and *Blue Shard*. Enter the next room, change up your team if necessary, then head in to the next room.

Time for another round with Aster and Eclipse! This time you'll have Aya as your partner, and thankfully her team actually puts in a decent amount of work in this fight, with lots of Water and Grass moves to deal with their numerous Water, Rock, and Ground type Pokemon. Aster and Eclipse like to set up screens against you with their leads, so you could consider bringing Brick Break or Psychic Fangs if these are annoying. Generally I find that Lunatone doesn't hit very hard, so if you are struggling with this one, you can continuously target the right side and get the battle to a 2-on-1 to make it simple.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Aya gets kidnapped (-2 Aya. This is not a choice, actually.)

After the fight, go to the left and grab *TM43 Flame Charge* within the room. Head out from the door on the right side. In this next cave, you can get a hidden *Great Ball* and *Aspear Berry*. Head outside, pick up a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Magical Seed*, and *Blast Powder* then proceed to Route 4.

If you bring a Pokemon with Lava Plume, Heat Wave, Incinerate, Eruption, Fire Pledge, or Flame Burst, use it in battle. This will allow you to get the *Fire Memory* in the campfire!

Enter Calcenon City to the west.

## Calcenon City

Inside the Pokemon Center, a person will tell you about the password *noitems*. Another person in here will offer an in-game trade: your Qwilfish for **Munchlax**!

Enter the gym at the top of the city.

Talk to Hardy in the left side of the city for some points if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy and Fern on the left side of the city (+1 Fern)

Talk to Saphira here twice. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you would throw her to the dogs for the ring with Saphira Points > 0 (+2 Charlotte, -1 Hardy, +1 Saphira)
- Tell Charlotte you would throw her to the dogs for the ring with Saphira Points <= 0 (+2 Charlotte, -1 Hardy, -1 Saphira)
- Tell Charlotte you would not throw her to the dogs (-2 Charlotte, +1 Hardy)

Anyways, walk over to the Route 4 exit and talk to Charlotte inside. She'll tell us it's time for a gym battle, so head back into Calcenon.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Saphira and Sigmund on the west side of the city (-1 Sigmund)

## Cinder Badge

Enter Charlotte's gym when you are ready. The puzzle here is basically the same as Wallace's from generation 3: you have to carefully step on every gray tile exactly once and make it to the other side's stairs. For precise solutions:

Head up to where Charlotte is. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Open the secret room in Charlotte's gym while she is present (+1 Charlotte)

Technically you shouldn't know how to open the secret room by this point... So if you want to respect the fact accessing this room and getting this point is more of an easter egg, you can skip to the right.

If you do want to open the secret room, you'll need to make the top area tiles look exactly like this:

Time for another of Reborn's double battle gym leaders. Her two leads, Darmanitan and Typhlosion, are incredibly fast and hit like trucks with their Fire moves. Particularly, Eruption will turn the field to Burning Field, making things even more difficult. Then, in the back, she has a seeded Ninetales who will amplify her Fire-type moves even more thanks to Drought, which also will cancel out your own helpful weather. With a bulky Rotom that can counter Water and Ground types easily and the speedy Heat Wave + coverage moves sets she has on her Delphox and Volcarona, Charlotte has a pretty strong team that can overwhelm unprepared teams by their sheer field-boosted power.

Both the Super-Heated Field and Burning Field benefit Charlotte a lot, but one hilarious strategy you can try is just using your own Fire types. You can just use your own Eruption, Heat Wave, etc. on her offense-oriented team. Alternatively if you find yourself stuck, Trick Room is an incredible strategy here - paired with Wide Guard, you can reliably set up Trick Room with many different Pokemon, and once you have it, her entire team will crumple to slow Rock moves, Ground moves on top of Gravity, or Water moves if you can keep it on Burning to avoid the Super-Heated Field damage weakener. You can alternatively outspeed via the Telluric Seed, a pretty incredible item when put on fast sweepers. There are tons of other crafty doubles strategies you can use on this fight, so get creative!

Once you win, you'll get the *Cinder Badge* which allows us to use Dive in the field and boosts the cap to Lv. 75. You'll also get *TM35 Flamethrower*! Very nice.

# Episode 14: //outlier.corruption

After your gym fight, enter the building in the bottom left side of Calcenon. You'll get *TMX6 Dive* inside! We could have gone in here earlier, but:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Charlotte before getting Dive (+1 Noel, +1 Shelly)

You can also talk to Hardy in here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in the Calcenon house about Charlotte (+1 Hardy)

With that, we now have all we need to Dive! There are a few quick things we can do, however!

## 11 Badge Quests

Enter the gate at the bottom of Calcenon. The guard inside will ask us to donate $40000 to repair the bridge that was broken in the previous chapter. You should have enough cash by now - if not you might have some Star Pieces from the Citae Astrae still in your bag. Once you cough up the cash the bridge will be fixed. Head outside and to the right on the stairs, and enter the cave here.

Inside, you can get an *Electrizer*, *Magmarizer*, and *Ghost Memory*. Re-enter Calcenon City. In the building to the right of the Pokemon Center you can trade this Magmarizer to get a **Magby**! In a building to the right of the gym you can trade the Electrizer for an **Elekid**! 

Head down to Route 3 via the new stairs. Down from here, you'll see a ladder. Interact with it to create a quick shortcut that allows us to go from Calcenon to Agate Circus super easily! Head to the circus.

To the right of the high striker you'll see a new vendor. For three Green Shards you can do another puzzle! This is in fact a [Fifteen Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). When you finish, it will look like this:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/turtwig.jpg"/>

For winning you'll get a Mew! Just kidding, of course, you get a **Turtwig!**

Talk to the person in the top right guarding the Ferris Wheel to get the *Fighting Memory*.

## Mountain Range Divin'

Next, I will return to the Celestinine Cascade. If you've yet to put the Crustle we moved to get Salandit back in place, now is a great time to do so.

Enter Celestinine Mountain by surfing up at the cascade.

Go left up the stairs at your first opportunity, and make your way across the ice here such that you can surf at the bottom of this area. Go down at the dive spot here.

Hidden down here, you'll find a hidden *Resist Wing* and a *Red Shard*.

**Celestinine Mountain B1F / B3F / 1F / 2F / Ametrine Mountain B3F / B2F / B1F / 1F / 2F Underwater Tunnels**

|Land              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Clamperl**      |45 |
|Chinchou          |30 |
|**Lanturn**       |15 |
|**Relicanth**     |10 |

Emerge at the other dive spot. You can find a hidden *PokeSnax* as well as *TM82 Dragon Tail* and an *Exp. Candy XL*. Make your way back. Next, head to Celestinine Mountain 2F and make your way to the large body of water. Dive down at the crescent-shaped spot.

To the right, you'll find the *Snowy Mountain Field Readout*. Up and to the right you'll find a *Water Stone*. Emerge at the dive spot in the upper right side. Up here you'll find the *PULSE Readout 2*. Oh dear.

Make your way back. Next, go to Ametrine Mountain 2F. Northeast of the iceberg, you'll find a dive spot.

Follow the path, diving up and down as you go. Once you pop up, you'll find another PULSE!

**Pokemon Redoubt. Field: Icy Field**
- PULSE Avalugg, Lv. 70, @Leftovers, Ability: Solid Rock, Brave Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/252/0/4/0.
    - Hammer Arm
    - Earthquake
    - Recover
    - Avalanche

With 255 in Def and SpD and a respectable HP, this thing is tanky. On top of this it has Leftovers and Recover, meaning it is extremely hard to kill by raw damage alone. It also has a great attack stat and can hit hard with field boosted Avalanche as well as Hammer Arm and Earthquake for coverage. Earthquake also has the side effect of laying spikes on your side, which can break Sashes and Sturdy. There are still a number of strategies that make this easy - it is a 6v1, after all. Toxic, for example, is pretty great. Heal Block, Knock Off, or Taunt can help with the recovery problem, Intimidate or other Atk debuffs can help neutralize its power, Counter or Metal Burst can ignore its high Def, etc. 

With that out of the way, head up the now-open ladder up to Ametrine Mountain 3F. Up here you can get a hidden *Green Shard*, *X Attack*, and *Blue Shard*. On the next floor, you'll find a hidden *Ice Gem*. Make your way to the door on the middle of the right side of the ice puzzle and exit.

Hidden here you'll find a *Purple Shard*, *Resist Wing*, *X Attack*, and *Ether* until you come upon the first fork. To the right along a narrow cliffside, you can find hidden *PokeSnax* and *Blue Shard*. Double back and go left. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Potion*, and *Zinc* as you proceed. Talk to Shelly here. 

Enter the small building nearby. Inside, talk to the old man to begin a quest. You can also talk to his computer to get the *Glitch Field Readout*. 

Head west at the next fork. You can get a hidden *Ether* around here. Enter this building. On the second floor, trade away your Pidove to a kid to get an *Old Amber*. Sweet. Head back outside and go to the left. You'll see a Lucario on a building, who will then run off. Follow it all the way right to the narrow cliffside, and it will run off with its egg.

Back at the main village fork, go down. In the south side of the city you can pick up hidden *Stardust*, *Big Pearl*, *Repel*, *Chewing Gum*, *Green Shard*, *Red Shard*, *X Sp. Atk*, *Full Heal*, *Tiny Mushroom*, and *Antidote*. Make sure you save this (or any) Tiny Mushroom for a quest later.

In the house next to the Pokemon Center, talk to the guy to learn of a glitch in his computer. Talk to the machine for a short battle gauntlet!

These battles aren't particularly tough, but it is our first real exposure to fighting on the glitch field, so try to get used to its quirks here. For winning, you'll obtain the *Department Store Sticker: Porygon-Z*. 

Enter the building above the ice rink. You'll get the *Battle Pass - Gravity*. Can't use it quite yet though. Back outside, talk to Shelly. While we're here, navigate through the ice rink and the child obstacles to reach the exit at the bottom. Follow it to get *TM95 Snarl*.

From here, head up to the now-open apartment at the center of town. Go to the top floor and talk to Shelly.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to refuse Blake all three times.**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Give Blake the ring right away (+2 Blake, -2 Cal)
- Refuse Blake once, then give him the ring (+2 Blake, -2 Cal, -1 Shelly)
- Refuse Blake twice, then give him the ring (+2 Blake, -2 Cal, -1 Shelly, -1 Heather)
- Refuse Blake all three times. (Anna +1, Shade +1, Cal +2, -2 Shelly, -2 Blake, -1 Heather)

If you gave Blake the ring, you'll get *TMX5 Waterfall.* If you didn't, you'll need to head outside to talk to Cal, then come back in to Blake's apartment.

Now we have to search Blake's room for clues to make a way out.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Check under Blake's bed (-1 Blake)

Under the left couch you'll find *3 Coins*, while the chair towards the bottom contains *1 Coin* and the bottom right sofa contains *2 Coins*. In the trash can at the top you'll find the head of a key. The game console contains a Program Disc. The drawer at the bottom contains a key handle, so you can open the cabinet at the top to get a power cable. Use the cable and the disc on the computer to open a prompt for a password. To get the password, search all the books and flowers around the room and talk to Shelly a few times! Input the code once you have it:

>5083164

Enter the secret passage and follow the path! On 6F you can find a hidden *Iron*.

Head outside and pick up the hidden *Flying Gem*. Talk to Shelly here. Once you have freed Heather, head into the shack and talk to the machine to get the *Flying Memory*! 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Free Heather after refusing to give Blake the ring (+1 Heather)

Make your way back to the main part of Ametrine and go all the way left. You'll have to defeat a few Meteor Grunts.

Grab a hidden *Red Shard*, *Dire Hit*, and *Repel* as you climb. You'll see a narrow passage at the top that leads up and left, which you can follow to get a *Full Restore*. 

Beat the grunts and continue. Pick up the hidden *Red-Hots* and *Swift Wing* then fight the next grunts.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly after she gets tired, after giving Blake the ring (+1 Shelly)

Continue up the mountain. You'll see another fork, one path leading you around a narrow cliff to the right that loops you to a lower path. Follow it to get a hidden *Ice Gem* and *TM79 Frost Breath*. 

Continue down the main path, picking up the hidden *Ice Heal*, *Telluric Seed*, *Max Repel*, and *Repel* along the way.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- After saving the police and exposing Corey, give Blake the ring, watch Blake and Heather's conversation (+1 Heather)

After beating the grunts here, go to the left and follow the path along the narrow cliff. Prepare for a quick fight.

**Pokemon Pariah. Field: Snowy Mountain Field**
- Lucario, Lv. 85, @Sitrus Berry, Ability: Steadfast, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 4/252/0/0/0/252
    - Extreme Speed
    - Meteor Mash
    - Swords Dance
    - Close Combat

It can sweep you if you're not prepared, but you can handle this surely. Once you win, head into the cave to get a *Fairy Memory* and an egg that will of course hatch into **Riolu**. 

Head into the cave entrance back on the main path.

### Refused Blake Route: Aster Fight

Due to our actions we still don't have Waterfall, but there's an extra fight to compensate!

    - Throat Chop
    - Swords Dance

Aster is back, this time completely alone. He has a generally fast and frail physical team, so try to exploit the Icy Field or just overwhelm him with a better singles team.

Winning will finally net you *TMX5 Waterfall*.

### The Battle Atop Ametrine

Inside this cave you can get a hidden *PP Up* and an *Ultra Potion* upstairs.

Emerge into the outside once more, pick up the *Common Candy* and *Shoal Shell*, then prepare for a fight at the top.

    - Swords Dance
    - Rock Slide
    - Iron Head

Blake has a pretty tough doubles team that takes advantage of the power of Water and Ice-types but mainly from the physical side. Intimidate Gyarados is good as usual, and paired with Snow Cloak Mamoswine they can crush your Pokemon that aren't as defensively blessed. In the back he has the speedy combo of Weavile, Starmie, and Slush Rush Sandslash, plus has a bulky Walrein with an extra 1.5x boost to defense thanks to natural hail. On top of that, the field boosts all of his Ice type attacks as well as Rock Slide, plus makes Thunder perfectly accurate. All in all this is a tough fight but not unbeatable!

You have lots of options in fact beyond the standard overpowered doubles strats you generally have access to now like Wide Guard + Trick Room. For example, you too can harness perfectly accurate Thunder to easily dispatch Gyarados and Starmie. This field may help out Ice-types but arguably it can help Flying-types even more: Flying attacks are boosted by 1.5x here and Tailwind grants Strong Winds, allowing your Flying-types to ignore their Ice weaknesses and granting another 1.5x boost! There are also a ton of boosted attacks and abilities on this field - a shoutout to Aurorus, who gets 1.5x for Refrigerate, AND 1.5x for Hyper Voice being boosted, AND 1.5x for Ice-type moves being boosted on this field! You can also turn it to mountain with a burning move to cancel out the Ice-type bonus on Rock-type moves, too!

Once you win, Blake will fail. Wah.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- If Saphira was abducted earlier, Cal tells you about Terra and Lin in depth (+1 Terra)

Cal will offer you a ride back to the main part of Ametrine.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Refuse Cal's offer down the mountain (-1 Cal)

Before we leave, enter the small house just south of Blake's apartment and give the girl inside a Floral Charm in exchange for the *Banettite*! Next, head on over to the Pokemart. Inside, a person will give you a *Magmarizer*.

## Glitch City

Before we proceed with the story, we can head over to Calcenon to get the following points:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Cain in Calcenon after fighting Blake (+1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in Calcenon after fighting Blake (+1 Hardy)

You can also head into Charlotte's gym - if you decided to 'cheat' and open the secret door earlier, you can now follow the path to get the *Charizardite X*.

Enter the house to the left of the gym if you refused to give Blake the Ruby Ring. Inside the bedroom you can get the *Shiny Charm*! If not, you'll be able to get it later on. 

With that out of the way, return to the Circus. Enter the Big Top and talk to Samson in the back. Terra will go into the computer... So it's up to us to follow, so talk to Samson and go in.

Welcome to Glitch City. Note that as we clear parts of this area we will never be able to return, so make sure you do everything you want to do in each before proceeding.

Make your way through Kanto Route 23 as normal until Terra destroys the guy! Go down the ladder that appears here.

    - Ice Beam

Bringing Mewtwo back to where it belongs with Glitch Field: completely broken. OK, there are still tons of ways to win these 6v1's as we've learned by now, but hey, Psystrike hits like a train.

Proceed and get ready for the gym battle! Note that you can actually exit back to the circus easily in case you want to do more prep.

Time to take on M3G4 T3RR4. As you've probably come to learn by now, the Glitch Field is pretty funky, enough that I'm gonna cover it with a whole paragraph before we even fight her. There are a few really important things about this field that you need to remember:

1. Type Matchups: all moves of the original physical types will be physical and all moves of the original special types will be special; additionally, Dark, Steel, and Fairy moves will all be retyped as Normal, Dragon always hits neutrally, Bug and Poison hit each other super-effectively, Ice hits Fire neutrally, and Psychic is immune to Ghost. Therefore, Pokemon like Weavile will find themselves significantly snubbed without attack-based STAB's. In some cases this can be good for you though, such as how physical Fighting types now have a stronger option in physical Focus Blast. 
2. Special attack damage: special attacks will be based on the higher stat of your SpA and SpD... an utter game changer, as now Special walls such as Shuckle and Toxapex are able to hit hard for once. It also means that raising Special Defense will increase both offensive and defensive capabilities - so moves like Cosmic Power and Stockpile basically lend themselves to creating a 1 Pokemon army. 
3. Speedy crits: the faster Pokemon on the field always gets a bonus to critical hit chance, so with a Razor Claw held you're getting crits for free 50% of the time, and nearly always with moves like Night Slash! Helpful for ignoring those aforementioned defense boosts. 
4. The Synthetic Seed turns a Pokemon into ???-type *with no weaknesses* and raises Defense. There are a few more things you can read about in the field notes but these are the main ones.

So, onto how Terra uses this field. You'll get a good example of principle 2 right away in her Nidoking, who will get bulkier and stronger by using Amnesia and then can hit hard with extra-accurate Blizzard, T-Bolt and Flamethrower to round out its special coverage. Hippowdon is bulky and likes to put you to sleep and hit with the ol' reliable Rock / Ground offensive combo, but more importantly, it sets up weather for its buddy Sand Rush Excadrill (who gets increased crit thanks to being fast!) to set up or just plain sweep you with it's insanely high attack stat. If that wasn't enough she has a mixed Garchomp who gets to ignore the SpA drops of Draco Meteor by calculating based on its SpD stat but can also hit with physical Bulldoze and Stone Edge. Rounding out her team is Palossand and Quagsire, each with the Synthetic Seed, neutralizing their weaknesses entirely and allowing each to set up with Amnesia and Recovery moves. Quagsire even has Unaware to ruin whatever similar SpD stacking strategy you have going! All in all a tough team that may really mess you up if you aren't using the field to maximum effect for your team.

The first thing I recommend for this fight is literally to find a list such as [this one](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VII)) and use it to find some Pokemon with really high SpD, since they are generally the best for this field. Especially if they have moves like Amnesia, Stockpile, or Cosmic Power, then you can use them to sweep once you get past Quagsire, especially if you decide to give them a Synthetic Seed. As I mentioned earlier, you can also try to stack your own crit monster, which should allow you a much easier time with the bulkier members of her team. One other thing to consider we saw earlier in the Mewtwo fight - Psychic moves get buffed, so you can find a Pokemon with suitable SpA or SpD and wear her down with those. 90% accurate Blizzard can be useful against Garchomp, Nidoking, and Hippowdon as well. Explosion halves defense as well, useful as a last-minute nuke against the ???-type tanks. You can also consider using Roar or Whirlwind on the pair, since that will wipe away their special typing and defense boost, allowing you to use Grass moves more easily on them. 

> Oh, and if you are able to make the Sandstorm and Stealth Rocks go away and kill Hippowdon, Shedinja with a seed is literally invincible.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Terra (-4 Terra, actually not a choice)

For winning, you'll get the *Gravity Badge* which lets us actually use Waterfall. We also get *TM78 Bulldoze*! We did it.

# Episode 15: Cascade

Head back outside. Before we proceed with the story, we've actually only seen like 30% of the massive three-mountain complex; much more of it is now accessible thanks to Waterfall. So, I will cover that in the next section.

## Mountain Range Waterfallin'

Enter Ametrine Mountain via the Route 3 entrance. Climb the nearby waterfall. Upstairs on 3F, you can get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Never-Melt Ice*. Across the ice you can find a hidden *Potion*. On the ice puzzle to the left, creep along the tiles above the ice, then go down onto a rock, left, and up. Grab a hidden *Super Potion*. Head up the waterfall to 4F.

At the top you can grab a hidden *Escape Rope*. Sadly we can't proceed on this route without Rock Climb, so hop down the ledge and make your way back down to 2F. 

Back on 2F, make your way to the waterfall down and left from the Route 2 entrance, then go down it. To the right, you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Escape Rope*, and *Exp. Candy L*. By smashing its favorite rock, you can catch a **Sneasel**. 

Surf down the waterfall to the left, then pick up a hidden *Full Heal* on the right. Land on the left side and make your way across the ice. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and push the boulder to the left. Head back up the waterfall, go left, pick up hidden *Paralyze Heal* and *Purple Shard*, then go down at the dive spot.

You'll find a hidden *Blue Shard* in the first room. Notice that there's a hard-to-spot door on the right side of the area - head in. This room contains a hidden *Antidote* and *Red Shard*. Surface here.

Grab a hidden *Full Heal* and *Health Wing* then proceed to the ice. Make your way to the top right corner of this area, and surf down. Grab a hidden *Water Gem* and climb down the fall.

In this next room, go left across the ice. Pick up a hidden *Green Shard* and *Pretty Wing*, then climb the waterfalls to the left. In the pool at the top, you can find **Totodile** jumping around. Talk to it while it's in the air for a battle.

Back at the ice puzzle in the room, go up this time. Grab hidden *Stardust* and cross this ice. Before going down the dive spot, go down the fall to get a hidden *Full Restore*. Dive down up above. Grab a hidden *X Sp. Def* on this map and enter the door towards the bottom. In the next room you can get a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Dark Gem*. Surface at the other end.

You can get a hidden *Pearl* and *Red Shard* in the next room, as well as *TM01 Work Up* and a *Razor Fang*. Backtrack all the way back to B1F.

This time, cross the ice to the left. Grab the hidden *Poke Ball* then dive down. Hidden in here are a *Green Shard*, *Genius Wing*, and *Red Shard*. We can also get a *Deep Sea Tooth*. Enter the door at the bottom.

**Celestinine Mountain B2F / Ametrine Mountain B2F Underwater Caverns**

|Land              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Chinchou          |30 |

|**Wailord**       |24 |
|Lanturn           |15 |
|Relicanth         |6  |

In this large room you can get an *Exp. Candy XL* and the *Snorlium-Z* as well as a hidden *Green Shard*, *Water Stone*, and *Super Potion*.

Also, specifically on Friday, you can find a **Lapras** roaming around this room!

Enter the door in the lower left side. In the next room you can find a hidden *Green Shard* and *Link Stone*, as well as the *Abomasite*! 

With that, backtrack all the way to Ametrine Mountain 1F where we pushed the boulder earlier. Go down some waterfalls until you reach Celestinine Mountain 1F, then go down the waterfall in the bottom right. At the split, go up and grab the hidden *Repel* then dive down. 

Underwater, pick up a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Exp. Candy XL*, *Iron*, and *Clever Wing*. Surface in the bottom left corner and cross the ice to get *TM47 Low Sweep*, then backtrack to the fork and go down.

Pick up a hidden *PP Up* by going up and left. Surf down the waterfall at the bottom. In the right corner you can get a *Potion*, but unfortunately that's all we can do here without Rock Climb. Backtrack to Celestinine Mountain 1F, then go up the ladder in the upper right side to return to 2F. Dive down at the crescent shaped spot and surface at the spot in the upper right side.

Climb the waterfall here to reach 3F. On this floor, you'll need to push boulders into the dead ends in order to skate around the entire area. You'll find a hidden *Aspear Berry* within, and a *Exp. Candy L* and hidden *Nugget* in the top left corner. Climb the waterfall to 4F.

**Celestinine Mountain 4F**

|Delibird          |1  |                  |   |

We can fish up an ugly fish on this floor! This room contains a hidden *Flying Gem* and *Green Shard* as well as *TM03 Psyshock*, a *Dragon Scale*, *Timid Mint*, *Water Memory*, and *Exp. Candy XL*. 

Backtrack all the way to Celestinine 2F once more, and make your way back to 1F. Go left across the ice to enter Citrine Mountain 1F. Surf straight down and pick up a hidden *Green Shard*, *Shoal Salt*, and *PokeSnax*. Push the nearby boulder to the left, then go up the waterfall and cross the now open ice patch. 

With the Silver Ring in hand, we can catch Corey's **Skuntank** here! Behind it, pick up the *Silver Card*. 

Make your way to Citrine Mountain 2F and climb the waterfall. Pick up the *Prism Scale* and hidden *Common Candy*. Climb the waterfall at the top. Here, you'll find 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, *Amplified Rock*, *Grass Memory*, *TM74 Gyro Ball*, hidden *Super Repel*, *Great Ball*, *Guard Spec.* and *Shoal Salt*. Oh, and you can get Corey's **Mareanie** here!

That wraps up our massive collection effort in the mountain complex. Return to Celestinine Cascade and head down the waterfall when you're ready.

## Water Treatment Center

Talk to Titania here, then enter the North Obsidia Water Grid at the bottom.

**Water Treatment Center**

|Mud Puddles       |%  |Water             |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Gulpin            |45 |Gulpin            |60 |

|**Swalot**        |10 |**Muk-Alola**     |9  |
|**Muk-Alola**     |5  |**Swalot**        |1  |

|Old Rod           |%  |Good Rod          |%  |

|Gulpin            |70 |Gulpin            |60 |
|**Grimer-Alola**  |30 |**Grimer-Alola**  |20 |
|                  |   |**Muk-Alola**     |20 |

In this area, we can hop across piles of trash if they're 2 spaces away. Make your way to the machine to the left - this is a water level machine. Pressing it will lower the water, letting us move trash around and progress. For now, lower the water and make your way to the right. In the very bottom right corner, in the mud, you'll find the *Murkwater Surface Field Readout* hidden behind a pillar. Go up and right to enter the Central Obsidia Water Grid.

Talk to Titania then hop down. If you go left, you can use a panel to open a shortcut.

Talk to Titania a few times in the center if you want.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Give Titania some candy when she says she is hungry (+1 Titania)

Lower the water level, then head down into the mud at the top. Push each of the trash to the right such that you'll be able to hop across them into the upper right area. Generally, keep in mind that when the water level rises, the trash will end up one tile higher than they appear to be on when the water level is lowered. Raise the water level when you're done and hop across. You can also use the panel to make a shortcut. Enter the Onyx Water Grid.

In this next room, Titania will be stranded on an island and the water level will be lowered. Push the trash into a position such that Titania will be able to jump across it to the right, then make your way up and to the right to raise the water. Once Titania clears the way, lower the water once more and go down into the Coral Water Grid.

Defeat the grunts towards the bottom, then go up and head down into the mud. Push the garbage above Titania so she can hop across. Raise the water, watch her move into a new spot, then lower the water and move the trash to help her again. Raise the water. Once Titania opens the way, lower the water and cross back into the Central Obsidia Water Grid.

Open the gate here. Lower the water level at the center and return to the bottom right corner, going down the stairs and following the path. Push the garbage into place so you can hop across, then raise the water and hop across. Use the panel up here, then lower the water level once more, then enter the door at the bottom left side to enter the Opal Water Grid.

Proceed to the left to enter the Peridot Water Grid. Use the panel here. Return to Opal Water Grid, go up into the North Obsidia Water Grid, and lower the water level if it is not down already. Move the two piles of trash from their current locations to the left side of the machine so that you can hop to the door at the left. Raise the water level and enter the Peridot Water Grid at this entrance.

Exit out of the door at the top right. Enter the next door and go up to get a *Hyper Potion*. Go back down and left into the Peridot Water Grid. You'll be able to hop across some trash here to get a *Quick Ball* and the *PULSE Readout 3*. You can also talk to the shutter here to open a door at the top of this room.

Enter this new room, and grab a hidden *Cell Battery*. In the top right is an *Electirizer*. Exit and re-enter, and now there will be an Electrode in the corner. Battle it and transform the Short-Circuit Field into Factory Field. Talk to the nearby machine to get **Fennekin**! 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Read the note that comes with Fennekin (+1 Ace)

Return to the previous room. Enter the Lapis Water Grid via the door at the top left. Go up to the top and go down the stairs to the mud. If you sneak past the trash to the bottom left you can get a *Smoke Ball*. Next, push the four rightmost trash to be all in a line, separated by two between each and such that the middle two surround the white pipe. Raise the water level, and you should now be able to hop across them altogether. Unlock the shutter, lower the water, and grab the *Beryl Grid Key*. 

Return to the previous room and use the gate at the bottom to reach the machine, then lower the water level. Unfortunately you'll have to return to the North Obsidia Grid and cross to the left to reach the upper area of the Peridot Grid once more.

Return to the Peridot Grid, and go right and down, then cross the mud. On the left side of the map, you'll see more stairs onto the mud, which eventually lead you to a hidden *Black Sludge*. Cross to the left into the Jasper Water Grid. Head left, then follow the path when the water is lowered. Go down onto the bottom section of the mud and go left to get a hidden *Full Heal*. Back on the land, defeat the grunts with Titania then proceed into the door at the top with your key.

In the Beryl Water Grid, go to the right, and Titania will get trapped. Head left and go down the stairs. Move the two trashes such that you can hop across up and right. Titania will help us out by raising and lowering the water level as we go, so don't worry. In the next area, push the garbage such that you can go across to the left.

Go down from here and follow the path through some rooms to the right, opening shutters for shortcuts as you go.

**Pokemon Stopple. Field: Murkwater Field**
- PULSE Swalot, Lv. 80, @Black Sludge, Ability: Water Absorb, Calm Nature, IVs: 27, EVs: 252/0/252/0/4/0.
    - Sludge Wave
    - Recover
    - Infestation
    - Discharge

PULSE Swalot is slow but extremely bulky, and also has not 1, not 2, but 3 separate ways to heal - Recover, Black Sludge, and healing via its ability on the field. It also is Poison-type, so you can't use Toxic and wait like you could with Avalugg. It also hits respectably hard, and thanks to Discharge paralysis and Infestation flat damage, so you're likly going to have a hard time trying to get your own tank set up against it. I recommend trying to neutralize its healing - Knock Off or Trick with a Sticky Barb, Gastro Acid or Entrainment, Heal Block or Taunt are all options that can successfully prevent it from getting HP back. Then, you can exploit the fact that Electric moves are boosted on this field to finally knock it out! 

Once you win, the Water Treatment Center will get fixed, but we'll need to make the water level in each room rise to make it clean again. To start, raise the water level nearby! Note that the normal water can be surfed on! Head east into the Central Obsidia Grid and fix the water level in here. Note you can surf to the right now to get *TM67 Smart Strike*.

Enter the Coral Water Grid in the bottom right. Fix the water, then enter the Onyx Grid at the top. Fix the water in here, then surf to the top of the room to get *TM93 Wild Charge*. Walk all the way back to the North Obsidia Grid.

Fix the water here, head left into the Peridot Ward, and fix the water once more. Head up into the Lapis Grid and fix the water. Fix the Jasper Grid's water, grab the *Scope Lens*, and finally return to the Beryl grid. Talk to Titania in the upper right corner. Surf to the top left corner of the room and proceed through all the barriers, then free Titania below. Use the Light Shard and go in. 

You'll have a decision to make.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to NOT battle Taka.**

All of the other choices we've made so far actually pale in comparison to the butterfly effect that comes following this choice. For reasons that will become clearer later on, the results of choosing to fight Taka are called the *Zekrom Route* and the results of choosing to not fight Taka are called the *Reshiram Route* by the community, and this guide will also use these conventions.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fight Taka (+2 Taka, +1 Ace, -1 Titania)
- Don't Fight Taka (+1 Anna, +1 Shade, -1 Ace, -2 Taka)

### Zekrom Route Taka Fight

If you're on the Reshiram route, skip ahead to the next section.

    - Nasty Plot
    - Hyper Voice
    - Roost

Time for another fight with Taka, but this one isn't really too hard hopefully. If you have something to deal with his lead, an Ice-type can basically steamroll his team.

### Ace Fight

Regardless of your route you'll have to fight Ace.

**Meteor Agent Ace of Spades (Max Potion). Field: Factory Field**
- Roserade, Lv. 71, @Focus Sash, Ability: Technician, Rash Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 4/0/0/252/0/252

    - Wild Charge
- Metagross, Lv. 74, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: Clear Body, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/0/0/4/0
    - Earthquake
    - Meteor Mash
    - Zen Headbutt
    - Bullet Punch

Time for another fight with Ace. This time they use a field that's fairly well designed for the Factory and Short-Circuit fields, thanks to multiple Steel and Electric moves. They also have Roserade, Zoroark, and Delphox to round out the well rounded squad. Flying and Ground-types working together in combination hit 5/6 mons super-effectively, so if you can manage speed and use these moves you will likely find a way to succeed.

After this fight, return to the front of the Water Treatment Center and climb the waterfall. 

## Fiore Mansion Gauntlet

Make your way towards the Fiore Mansion, and you'll meet up with some old characters and obtain *TMX2 Fly*! About time. Heal and prepare your team and then head in... we have a huge Gauntlet coming up! Thankfully, this one will heal us between each fight.

This first fight is a 12v9 against some grunts. Florinia is pretty helpful here, and none of their Pokemon are too strong. It's more of a warmup fight.

    - Leaf Blade

This battle in the gauntlet is a bit harder. Since Florinia's team is so slow, I really recommend using Trick Room in this fight - if you can ensure Scizor dies, you can generally overrun their teams with strong super-effective moves. We've beaten these two on their own so if you can generally figure out how to support Florinia in taking them out, you can find a way through this fight.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Florinia joins your team after you did not defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Florinia)
- Julia joins your team after you did defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Julia, -1 Fern)

The hardest battle in this gauntlet is the last one. On one hand, Solaris' team basically consists of six threats - Bullet Punch Scizor, Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Garchomp among them. On the other hand, John's team consists of some slower Pokemon to dampen Trick Room, with much wider coverage and some support moves. Nothing on their team is entirely dead weight really, and since you only get to control the actions of one of two of the Pokemon on your side, you can't really do any insane doubles strats to force a ton of momentum onto your side.

Plus, if you defeated Solaris on Pyrous, you'll have Julia as a partner, who sadly doesn't have a very good time overall against the pair thanks to their numerous Ground and Electric types, though she can help against some of the Flying types. She also literally has a Rotom Fan with an Air Balloon... Otherwise, you'll have Florinia as a partner once more, making Trick Room more potent and allowing her to do a decent amount of the work. I recommend quick-saving before this fight and resetting at least a few times just to try different moves at different times - with the 12v12 format, things can change dramatically depending on what the pairings happen to be at any given moment. If you have to quit to change up your team, you'll have to fight the first two again.

After these events finish playing out, head outside of the building and talk to Titania. Return to the circus!

## Suspension Badge

Talk to Samson. You'll be given the *Battle Pass - Suspension*. Sweet. Save, then talk to Ciel when you're ready for another gym battle!

Ciel is the first fight for a badge that repeats the field used by another, but it is still very different. Many of the strategies I recommended using to beat Samson are employed by Ciel against you in this fight - the emphasis is no longer on High Striker moves - Altaria, Minior, and Gliscor have Earthquake, and that's it. Instead, she relies on super-boosted Acrobatics, Revelation Dance, and sound-based moves that dazzle the crowd and gain power. Oh, and she has the first enemy Mega Pokemon we have to face in Mega Altaria. 

Similarly to Samson, you can win by just exploiting this field's many effects. Just as I recommended using Acrobatics and Revelation Dance against Samson, it could be really funny to use your own High Strikin' Pokemon with Smack Down and Earthquake, since her team past Gliscor doesn't have a ton of defense. Nothing on her team resists Acrobatics, additionally, Electric-type Revelation Dance can rip through all but Gliscor and Altaria pretty easily, so you can just use her strategies right back at her. Even if you don't care a ton about the field, you can also just use Trick Room and a couple slower Ice and Rock types to bowl over her team.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Ciel on your first try (+2 Samson)
- Defeat Ciel on your second, third, etc. try (-1 Samson)

For winning, you'll get the Suspension Badge, boosting our cap to a whopping Lv. 80! You'll also get *TM62 Acrobatics*. Useful. Most importantly though, we can now Fly... meaning we can once more return to Reborn City.

# Episode 16: A City, Reborn

Head outside the big top. Before we fly back to Reborn City and other previously inaccessible areas, we can snag a new more points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy on Route 4 (+1 Hardy)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Cain in Calcenon City (+1 Cain)

## Tanzan Cove Water Exploration

So, we now have access to a ton of areas we've previously visited, plus we can now use Surf, Waterfall, and Dive. I'll later explain the bizarre choice of going here first, I will first take us to Tanzan Cove. So, fly to the Belrose Manse.

Dive underwater in the Tanzan Cove. 

**Tanzan Cove Underwater**

Down here you'll find a *Metronome*, *Big Nugget*, and the *Flower Garden Field Readout* as well as hidden *Escape Rope*, *Potion*, *Repel*, *Awakening*, *Grass Gem*, *Burn Heal*, *Red Shard*, *Chesto Berry*, *X Sp. Atk*, and *Great Ball*. Talk to the bodies of the Meteor grunts down here to get a *Spooky Plate*, and *Hyper Potion*. In particular, make sure you talk to the body with the missing ID tag on the left side of the area.

Return to the surface and talk to the fisherman on the right side of the map. If you've done all the steps of Simon's quest so far, you'll be given the *Super Rod*! I brought us here first so I could list surfing and super rod encounters at the same time :\)

|Swanna            |4  |                  |   |

To continue Simon's quest, we'll need to donate 3 locally-caught Whiscash to this guy. Do so, and you'll get the *ID Tag*. We'll finish this quest a bit later.

For now, surf across the lake to the island on the left. Grab the hidden *Calcium* then go into the cave.

## Neo Opal Ward

Ok, with that out of the way, we can finally begin to explore Neo Reborn City - The entire city actually was renovated while we were away. Neat. Go ahead and fly there. 

If you want to blitz through the story, you can talk to Ame in the Grand Hall and tell her you're waiting for her, but there are tons of nice things we can get before we talk to her, so I will pass on doing so for now. 

Note that there are a ton of sidequests and main quests that will take us all over the city and to other areas beyond, so there isn't really a clean way to cover all of it without a bit of backtracking here and there. For now, I will take us through every ward one-by-one to cover everything we can get right now. Thankfully there are no more cracks in the streets and we can fly to any ward we choose, so that makes it simpler.

Hidden in the ward are an *Elemental Seed*, *Dawn Stone*, *Mental Herb*, *Super Repel*, and *Hyper Potion*. To access the water part of the ward, enter the area under the bridge via Peridot where we once encountered Pansear / Panpour, then surf down and to the right to emerge. Follow this path through to South Obsidia Ward to get a *White Flute*. 

## Neo Peridot Ward

That's all for Opal right now, so head west into Peridot.

First, head up into the park to the right of the Pokemon Centerpokem to talk to Elder Seacrest. He will give us a quest: collect the four types of mulch scattered about the city. Use your Itemfinder all around the lower part of the ward to get an *Ultra Potion*, *Super Repel*, *X Defend*, *Blue Shard*, *Eject Button*, as well as the *Damp Mulch*, which is in the park around where we once got Whismur and Gulpin. Head into the Lower Peridot Alleyway.

**Neo South Peridot Alley**

|Manectric         |2  |

Hidden here are *Dark Gem*, *Red Shard*, and *Flying Gem*.

Heading to the upper side of the ward, we can get a hidden *Ice Heal*, *Carbos*, *Guard Spec.*, *Escape Rope*, *Poke Ball*, *Purple Shard*, *Nugget*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, and *Blast Powder*.

In the former Mosswater Factory there is now a market.

**Mosswater Market Move Tutor: Max**

|Move               |Price          |
|-------------------|---------------|
|Aqua Tail          |5 Blue Shards  |

|Tailwind           |7 Green Shards |
|Zen Headbutt       |5 Purple Shards|
|Stealth Rock       |7 Red Shards   |

There is also a guy selling a new item that will allow you to move all EV's from one stat into another. 

**Mosswater Market Tuner Shop**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|5x EV Tuners   |$40000     |

Head up and enter the house where we once got Igglybuff. If you return it to her, you'll get a *Luck Incense* and a *Pixie Plate*. 

Outside her house and down, there is a tent. Hidden underneath this tent is an NPC who will give you the *Expert Belt*. I have played this game many times and only just learned about this.

Enter the building that Simon is in and show him the ID Tag we found inside of Whiscash. You'll be rewarded with *TM06 Toxic* to finish the Simon quest.

Enter the former Blacksteam Factory. Inside, you'll find an NPC who'll give you the password *penniless*. In the room that once contained Muk, you can talk to a guy who will bet you $1000 increments for coin flips. If you beat him a few times, he'll run out of money but trade you *TM27 Return* for all the money you collected so far. You can put a Pokemon with Super Luck at the front of your party to always win, or simply save in front of him before you bet.

Enter the North Peridot Alleyway outside.

Hidden in the ward you'll find a *Cheri Berry*, *Rawst Berry*, and *Grass Gem*. 

Inside the police station, talk to the chief to continue the stolen Pokemon quest. If you head back into Peridot Ward, to the right of the Igglybuff lady's house, you'll see a guy who looks like Corin Rouge that you can fight. We'll find the other two later.

Enter Malchous Forest to the left.

Later on, we'll need a Male Lurantis and a Female Lurantis for a quest, so it might be a good opportunity to get those now. 

You'll find a *Balm Mushroom*, 5 *Exp. Candy L*, and a hidden *Synthetic Seed*. Make sure you don't sell the former. The abandoned gym has been replaced with soft soil to grow berries in. To start, you can get *4 Enigma Berries*, *4 Starf Berries*, *2 Aguav Berries*, *2 Mago Berries*, *2 Micle Berries*, *2 Iapapa Berries*, *2 Figy Berries*, a *Leppa Berry*, and a *Wiki Berry*.

You'll also find another guy who looks like Corin Rouge you can fight in the Forest Park!

## Neo Beryl Ward

Head into Beryl next. Go right across the Beryl Bridge. If you show the Yureyu Key we got earlier to the tech guy near the power plant, you'll get a *Zap Plate*.

You'll notice that there are a ton of invisible obstacles all over Beryl and the surrounding areas, but we can't do anything about them right now. Still, we can maneuver around many of them to get some goodies.

Hidden in Beryl you can get a *Poison Gem*, *Blue Shard*, *Magical Seed*, *Red Shard*, and the *Gooey Mulch* in the central park.

Before we leave, there are a few more things to do in Beryl. Enter the library and pick up the *Library Application* at the desk. This is the first of many applications we can grab to help us complete a sidequest later on. Upstairs you'll learn about the *monowoke* password. At the southwest corner of town, there is a shop run by the Inspector guy.

Talk to the girl outside the nightclub to get a *Nightclub Application*. 

Enter the Spyce restaurant on the right. At the counter you can grab a *Spyce Application*. Once the chef pops out of the kitchen, talk to him to begin the chef's quest. He'll ask us to bring the following items: Honey, Tiny Mushroom, Balm Mushroom, Slowpoke Tail, White Herb, Stick, Sweet Heart, Moomoo Milk, Energy Root, Custap Berry,  Whipped Dream, and Shoal Salt. A few of these we may not have quite yet, so I will return in a bit to finish this quest.

Hidden around this part of the ward are an *HP Up*, *Pop Rocks*, *Green Shard*, *Elemental Seed*, as well as the *Growth Mulch* in the park on the bottom right side.

Back in Obsidia, there are tons of shops we can access. Enter the Sweet Co. HQ in the former Yureyu building. Talk to someone behind the desk to get a *Sweet Application*. 

Enter the building to the right on Saffron Street. After seeing a conversation, talk to the girl to learn about the invisible obstacles in Beryl. We can't do anything about it yet though. The person at the top will give us the *Silph Application*.

You can find hidden *Green Shard*, *Fairy Gem*, *Magical Seed*, and *Max Repel*. 

Enter the building in the upper right side. Danielle will give you another quiz! Feel free to go find the answers yourself if you'd like. Otherwise, here they are. 

> 15, 30, 23, 0, 42, any answer

Once you succeed, you'll get the *Fairy Tale Field Readout*. 

Talk to one of the fisherman at the bottom of Coral Ward and agree to buy the *Slowpoke Tail* for the ridiculous price. Once he learns you're doing it for Spyce, you'll get it for free. 

Surf into the Coral Ward bay. We'll deal with Azurine Lake to the left later on, but for now, fight the trainers here. Behind the bottom lighthouse is a hidden dive spot.

You can find a hidden *Elixir* and *Moon Ball* on this map. Follow the path and surface in the lighthouse. Up the ladder you can get a *Big Nugget*, *Jolly Mint*, and *Coral Key*. Make your way back to the bay and use the key on the other lighthouse door. Dive down and go left and prepare for a battle.

This is a 6v2 fight that might kick your butt simply because Underwater Field allows these two to outspeed nearly every Pokemon you have and either hit hard with field boosted moves or set up with Shell Smash / Double Team. If you can control the speed somehow or have something bulky enough to hit back, you can find a way through this one.

Once you win, you'll get **Popplio**! Beyond, you'll find *TM68 Giga Impact* and a hidden *King's Rock*. There's also a slightly different encounter table here.

Next, fly into Onyx Ward. You can find a hidden *Burn Heal*, *X Defend*, and *Red Shard*. A person in the upper left corner will also give you a *Full Restore*.

Head up to the rooftop garden if you'd like.

Enter the Onyx Trainer School and go all the way to the left. Talk to the girl here to get a *Sweet Heart*. On the second floor, enter the open double doors then go up the stairs to the third floor. Talk to the girl on the left. Return to the first girl and you'll get a *Incinium-Z*! 

By now, we should be able to give all the ingredients to the Spyce. Once you do, you'll get 2 *Leftovers*! 

## Neo Spinel Town & Chrysolia Spring

That wraps up things in the city limits for right now, so fly over to Spinel Town. Enter the museum.

Make your way down to Chrysolia Forest and enter the Chrysolia Spring.

Surf across and push the first boulder out of the way and grab a hidden *Common Candy*. Towards the top, you'll need to push a boulder onto a nearby water stream, when you do so, it will make the other one larger. Surf onto that larger jet to be pushed up on a ledge! Grab the hidden *Red Shard* and *X Defend* then push the boulder into the hole. Grab the *Red Card* then jump down.

|Camerupt          |1  |                  |   |

Head up and grab the *Exp. Candy XL*. Next, go all the way down and take the large jet back to the first floor. Grab the hidden *Psychic Gem* then head back to B1F. 

Essentially, this single boulder in the center can solve four different puzzles, each in a different corner of this room. 

I will start with the top left direction. For this direction, you'll essentially need to push this boulder onto the nearby water stream... but despite being only 2 tiles away, we will need to push it the long way all the way around the lake here. Note that as you push the boulder, it will block your path at various points, and if you can't access the direction you need to push the boulder from, try surfing around to get it. Note that you can push it while you're surfing next to it, but can't push it into the surf water.

This area contains a hidden *Elixir*, *Green Shard*, and *Rock Gem*. Once you successfully push the boulder into the final spot, step onto the tall water jet to return to 1F. You can get a hidden *Water Gem* here. Push the boulder in the top right corner onto the jet in the bottom left corner, then hop up the ledge and enter the cave. 

Inside the sauna, if you want, you can blow away the steam with a wind-based move, but it's not necessary other than for visibility. You can get an *Exp. Candy XL*, *Timid Mint*, and the *Cameruptite* in here.

Make your way back to B1F, this time doing the bottom left direction with the boulder. Push it onto the jet in the bottom left, then go up the stream to the bottom right side. Grab the hidden *Super Potion* and move the nearby boulder onto the jet in the bottom right. Go up the tall jet to 1F.

In this portion you can find a hidden *Blue Shard*. Push this boulder onto the jet in the bottom left corner, then hop up the jet. Jump down the hole, get the hidden *Red Shard*, then go into the sauna. 

Grab the *Modest Mint*. There are three jets in this room - the bottom one is inaccessible by boulders. Push the two boulders onto the other two, then go up the tall jet. Grab the *Exp. Candy XL* and *TM50 Overheat* here.

Return to B1F, this time doing the top right direction with the boulder. Grab the hidden *Water Gem* here. You'll need to temporarily push the boulder up, surf across, and move another boulder out of the way in order to push the boulder down and onto the jet. 

On 1F, grab the hidden *Dusk Ball*. Essentially 5 of these boulders are duds, and you'll need to get them out of the way of the single boulder that you can move onto the jet. Of the bottom right pair, it is the left one. Once you get it into place go up the jet and follow the path to the sauna.

In here, you can get a *Jolly Mint*, *Red Flute*, *Big Nugget*, and *Exp. Candy XL*. 

Make your way back to B1F, and finally push the boulder in the bottom right direction. You'll find a hidden *Big Pearl* and *Flame Plate* in this area. This puzzle should be straightforward by now, just note that you'll need to at some point surf across the rightmost pond and push the second boulder right to clear the path. Use the big jet to reach 1F.

Up here, you can get a hidden *Awakening*. To finish this puzzle, you'll need to push the boulder counter-clockwise around this area to reach the jet. Follow the path to the final sauna. 

This room has a lot of ledges, and is a bit chaotic. Clear the fog if you're confused. You'll find an *Exp. Candy XL*, *Adamant Mint*, *TM61 Will-o-Wisp*, as well as a hidden *Fire Gem*. Exit the Chrysolia Spring once you're done. 

## Iolia Valley & Aventurine Woods Water Exploration

Fly on over to the Vanhanen Castle and make your way to the Iolia Valley. 

**Iolia Valley**

|Seaking           |6  |Dewgong           |20 |

Climb the waterfall at the top of the area, grab the hidden *Nugget*, and follow the path to get a *Dark Material*. Next, surf your way all the way down the valley. Use the green crystal beneath the waterfall to get *TM89 U-Turn*. 

Exit the valley and return to Route 1. Grab a Tauros and head into the top right North Aventurine Woods entrance. 

**North Aventurine Woods**

|Super Rod / Water |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Dewpider          |95 |
|Araquanid         |5  |

At the top, you can surf across to get the *Sharpedonite*!

Make your way all the way to the left to the entrance of North Aventurine Woods that leads to Celestinine Mountain 2F. Across the ice and in the bottom left corner we can now surf on this body of water. You'll find a *Shoal Shell* and hidden *Revive* directly across. Dive down to the right.

Down here, you'll find a hidden *Steel Gem*, 2 *Blue Shards*, *Ether*, and *Rare Candy*. You'll also find 5 *Exp. Candy XL* at the top. Towards the right, there is a door to a deeper cavern, surface to get a *Deep Sea Scale* and a *Big Nugget*. 

That's it for this area right now! 

## Neo Apophyll Beach

Fly over to the Apophyll Academy and enter the academy. Talk to the girl in the first room to get the *Apophyll Application*. In the academy's center area you can find a hidden *Purple Shard*. 

Head down into the meditation spot where we once met Kiki.

In the map surrounding the academy, you'll be able to find 3 hidden *Shoal Shells* and a *Protein*, as well as hidden *Shoal Shell* and *Health Wing* above the academy.

Head to the Apophyll Beach to the right side of the academy. On this map you'll be able to find a hidden *Calcium* and 5 *Shoal Shells*. Making our way to the map on the left side of the academy, we can get a hidden *Ultra Potion*, *Star Piece*, and *Rock Gem*. 

Next, make your way all the way to the top of Pyrous Mountain. From the bottom of the lava crater we can actually fish.

## Azurine Lake

Next it's time to cover the actual Azurine Lake! There are tons of things we can do in this gargantuan area. To start, surf up from the Apophyll Academy, and enter the cave in the rock formation.

Pick up the *Underwater Field Readout* and the *Exp. Candy XL* as well as the hidden *Great Ball* and *Focus Sash*.

Head down and to the right. You'll see a narrow strip of sand, which you can land on at the top. You can get a hidden *Shoal Shell* and *Ultra Ball* as well as a *Sun Stone* here. Dive down here to explore the Fairview Apartments area. 

**Azurine Lake Underwater**

Hidden on this underwater map you can find a *Shoal Shell*, *Purple Shard*, *Awakening*, *Blue Shard*, *Ultra Potion*, and *Poke Ball*. You'll notice that the buildings around here are numbered, and many of them are locked, but some are not. Starting from the bottom, we will explore them.

On the right side you can enter one house containing a *Relic Silver* as well as a hidden *Salt-Water Taffy* and the *F14 Key*. To the left and slightly up you'll find another unlocked building containing 5 *Exp. Candy XL* as well as a hidden *Blue Shard*. Up from here, you'll find a locked building called Fairview 14, which we now have the key to! Inside, you can get a *Relic Gold* as well as the *S9 Key* hidden. Up from here you'll find an open house containing a *Relic Copper* and the *F34 Key* hidden. 

Make your way to the very bottom of the underwater area and use your new key on the corresponding building. Inside you can get a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Water Gem* and the *F1 Key*. Make your way all the way to the top of the underwater area now and use the key to get a *Blue Flute*. 

Surface somewhere in the upper part of the underwater map. You can find a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and 2 *Shoal Shells*.  

That wraps up this section of the lake for now. Fly over to Coral Ward and surf west. Once you see sand, you can get a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Hyper Potion* as well as a *Fist Plate*. You'll also be able to battle the third guy who looks like Corin Rouge here!

From here, go southwest, but not too far. You'll notice a 2-by-2 dive spot between some rocks. Dive down here to access the Faeward Apartment area. You can get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Big Pearl* down here. 

Inside the top house you can get a *Relic Vase*, 2 *Exp. Candy XL*, and the *Primarium-Z*. Hidden here also are a *Purple Shard* and an *Ultra Potion*. Returning to the surface in the main part of the underwater section will lead you to a hidden *Weakness Policy* on the island.

Return to the spot with the swimmer, then make your way west (to the south is Azurine Island, which I'll cover later on). Once you hit a wall, a little bit down you'll see another strip of sand that you can land on. 

Grab the hidden *Carbos* here and surf down and left. Before diving down, go to the left onto another sandy island to get a hidden *X Speed* and *Elixir*. At the top left corner is another 2-by-2 dive spot, so go down here to get a hidden *Super Repel* and *TM16 Light Screen*. 

Now, return to the larger dive spot we previously skipped to reach the Sunrise Apartments area. Hidden on the underwater map you'll find a *Green Shard*, *Blue Shard*, *Big Pearl*, and *Purple Shard*. 

The building in the bottom right side is unlocked, and you'll find a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Green Shard* and the *S12 Key*. There is another unlocked house at the top containing a *Relic Silver*, and a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and the *K33 Key*. 

Surface towards the top of the underwater area and go up and left to reach an island. Grab the *Water Stone* and hidden *Shoal Shell* it contains then surf up and to the right. You can get a hidden *Red Card* in the bottom right corner. Dive down here.

On this map you can get a hidden *Green Shard*, *X Speed*, and *Red Shard*. We can unlock the S12 house all the way to the right to get a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Green Shard* and the *S4 Key*. A nearby building is unlocked and contains a *Heart Scale* and hidden *Ice Heal*. Unlock the S9 building to the left to get the *Glalitite* and a hidden *Purple Shard*. You can unlock S4 in the bottom left to get *TM98 Power-Up-Punch* and a hidden *Escape Rope*. 

Fly to Peridot Ward. Make your way to the building Simon is in and go south, and you'll be able to surf from here. Battle the trainers as you proceed down and right. Once you encounter a fork in Lower Peridot, go to the left all the way. 

You'll be spit out right next to Apophyll Cave. Notice that there is a small path you can surf through to go up from here, so take it. At the very top you can get a *King's Rock*. Head down, following the right wall of rocks until you are able to pass through an opening. Surf to the various islands around the outside here to find a hidden *Sky Plate* and *Ether*. You can also get a hidden *Red Shard* and *X Sp. Atk* on the large central island. 

Dive down here into the Kingsbury Apartments area. Underwater you'll find a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Ether*, *Awakening*, and *Poke Ball*. 

Now I will explore the buildings from the top. In the top left corner one is unlocked and contains a *Glitter Ball*, which is a custom ball that either has a high catch rate on shiny Pokemon or has a normal catch rate but *turns the Pokemon it catches shiny*. Very cool. Head right from here and enter an unlocked building to get the *Splash Plate* as well as hidden *Salt-Water Taffy* and a *Blue Shard*. Down and right from here you'll reach a large unlocked building containing a *Relic Silver* as well as hidden *Red-Hots*, *Pokesnax*, and the *K22 Key*. We can unlock the K33 building to the left from here to get a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Common Candy*. In this building you can also talk to the upper left cabinet and use an antidote to get a **Mudkip**!

Enter the building to the left to get a hidden *Blue Shard*, *Purple Shard* and the *K5 Key*. Left and up from here you can enter the K22 building to get a *Relic Copper* as well as a hidden *Blue Shard* and the *K2 Key*. Head all the way up in the underwater section and enter K2 to get the hidden *F10 Key*. Around to the right you can enter K5 and get a *Max Revive*. Nice.

Next, in the underwater section, on the left side of the loop you'll notice a bright 2-by-2 spot. Surface here specifically and surf around to the other side, grabbing the hidden *Level Ball*. Enter this cave.

Past a hidden *Genius Wing* you'll see a Pyukumuku atop a hill, who we can battle.

**High King of the Pyukumuku. Field: Cave Field**
- Pyukumuku, Lv. 100, @Leftovers, Ability: Unaware, Bold Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/100/0/160/0
    - Recover
    - Soak
    - Toxic
    - Block

An annoying set that might ruin your team if you're unprepared! Taunt and Toxic completely shut it down, however. You can also take the cave ceiling down!

Beyond, you'll get *TM59 Brutal Swing*. Head up the waterfall. You can get an *Exp. Candy XL* up here as well as a hidden *Hyper Potion*. Atop another waterfall is a hidden *Icicle Plate*. You'll notice that we can't access the other room thanks to a strong current - we'll need to transform the Water Surface into the Icy Field! You can use Blizzard yourself or surf until you find a wild Sealeo and hope that it uses it.

Enter the cave once it freezes over and you can get the *Aloraichium-Z* as well as the *Audinite*. You can also get a hidden *Exp. Candy L* and *Level Ball*. 

Exit this cave, and make your way back into the large underwater area. Now, surf to the bottom left corner of the area. Enter the unlocked house at the bottom to get a *Relic Copper*. Hidden here is a *Purple Shard* and the *Diamond Ring*, an item we will use for a sidequest in a few subsections. Back outside, surface in this corner of the underwater map. On the left you'll notice a 2-by-2 dive spot that will lead you to the *Altarianite*. 

There is one more thing we can do in these apartment areas: we have one key remaining. Fly back to the Apophyll Academy and make your way east onto the sand strip to re-enter the Fairview Apartments area. Towards the top on the right side underwater you'll find the F10 building which contains the *Beedrillite*! 

## Neo Azurine Island

To finish off our exploration of the Azurine Lake, we will next check out Azurine Island. Surf west from Coral Ward and go down when you're able to to reach Azurine Island once more.

Note that there are many Foongus and Amoonguss disguised as items, but fighting them now can save you some time for a later sidequest. 

Just for fun, I will change it up and do a counter-clockwise spiral inwards this time to get all the items.

Snag a *Tiny Mushroom* and hidden *Clever Wing* on the first island. Surfing to the left you can get a hidden *Big Mushroom*. Surf down from here and pick up the *Tiny Mushroom* towards the bottom left side of the area. Another *Tiny Mushroom* is to the right, and yet another *Tiny Mushroom* past the building to the right. You'll also find a hidden *X Sp. Def* here.Continuing our trip around the outside, you'll find a hidden *Elemental Seed* in a shrub. Above you can get a hidden *Blue Shard*. Towards the top of the loop, you can get a *Tiny Mushroom* and a hidden *Telluric Seed*.

Now, head down to the middle island and cut the tree. Follow the path right and defeat the Foongus and jump down the ledge. To the right you'll find a hidden *Resist Wing*. Head right more from here and surf down, defeating Foongus as you go. Head left from here. Pick up a *Tiny Mushroom* as well as a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* to the left in a rock. Left from here is a hidden *Repel*. That does it for this island, for now.

## Trading Sequence Quest

Now, it's time to do something with the Diamond Ring we found underwater. Fly over to Jasper Ward and enter the top left building. Inside, give the girl here the ring we found to get the *Classified Information*. 

Next, head over to Peridot Ward and enter the building to the left of the North Peridot Alley. Defeat the cop inside and after a conversation you'll get the *Pink Pearl*. Grab the *Mind Plate* behind.

Fly over to Coral Ward and enter the northern warehouse. Talk to the girl with Spoink to get the *Crystal Ball*. 

Fly over to Jasper once more and attempt to enter the building on the right side of the area. Defeat the two trainers who challenge you, then enter the building. In the room at the top you can get a *Yellow Flute* and the *Starlight Arena Field Readout*. Head upstairs and talk to the lady to get the *'R' Key*! You can also talk to her again for some lore.

Head into the Blacksteam Shelter in Peridot Ward. In the room where we were once stuck in a cage, talk to Randall and return his key. In return, you'll get his **Klefki**!

You'll notice that our new Pokemon is actually holding the *Sanctum Key*. Head back down to Seventh Street with this key in your bag, and return to the subseven sanctum. In the mazelike room, enter the door on the left side with the key. Pick up the *Dark Material* and 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Read the green books for some lore and note the colors of the Arceus statues on the left for later, then head out. That's it for this questline right now!

## Agate Circus Fishing

With the Super Rod in our bag, there are some new Pokemon we can get in the circus-and-beyond area. Fly back to the Agate Circus. You can get a *Circus Application* towards the top of the area while you're here. For completeness here are all of the encounters:

## Beldum Quest 

Time for a weird one.

Fly over to the Byxbysion Wasteland. Inside the hideout, drop all but 1 Pokemon in the PC - we are going to intentionally white out in a second, so this will save us a lot of time. If they have Memento or Explosion that's extra good, but make sure they are strong enough to also defeat a Level 47 Bouffalant.

Talk to the malfunctioning healing machine and plug in a data chip to fix it. Heal at this machine.

Fly over to Route 1 Nature Center and defeat a Bouffalant to climb a Tauros. Next, you'll need to white out while riding Tauros - fighting another Tauros or Bouffalant may make this easier.

Once you reappear in Lana's house... you'll somehow still be on your Tauros, but I assure you this is not a bug but a feature. 

Exit the building and go down. Hop down the ledge beyond the rock smash, and climb up the nearby ledge. Enter the cave and go into the secret path behind the left canister. Follow this path to the left and climb the ledge and push the boulder to reach the area where we once found Squirtle.

From here, climb the ledges up and to the right to reach the previously unreachable cave entrance. Climb the ladder and go up the ledge. Grab the *Big Nugget*, save, and talk to the broken canister at the top for a battle with a Lv. 1 **Beldum**. You'll have to be careful to not let it knock itself out with Take Down. Its low catch rate will also complicate things, so reset if you need to.

Once you're done, head outside and ditch Tauros. Thanks, Tauros! 

## Mega Z-Ring Quest

There's one more major quest that we can take care of! If we skip this section and proceed with the story, this will actually be locked of for us for another two badges or so, so take care of this now if you don't wanna miss this excellent reward. 

Head over to the Nightclub in North Obsidia. You'll see DJ Arclight inside if you've bought all of the Pokemon from the Seventh Street Pokemon seller. If not, now's a good time to get them all. Anyways, we'll be tasked with returning five of the Pokemon that we found then.

Head to Jasper Ward and take the Loudred out of the PC. Talk to the person in the bottom left two times and she will take back her Loudred.

Next, take Jigglypuff out of the PC and head over to the North Peridot Alley. Talk to the bottom guy a few times and defeat him in battle. Afterwards, return to the Jasper Ward and give the Jigglypuff to the Loudred girl.

Fly over to the Apophyll Academy and get Makuhita out of the PC next. Talk to the girl in the middle of the rooms on the left side of the outside area. Fly back to North Obsidia and talk to Arc to get the *DJ Arc Autograph* and give it to the girl at Apophyll. Talk to her again to give her Makuhita, then once more after that.

Fly over to Spinel Town next and grab Roggenrola from the PC. Two buildings from the left of the museum, you'll find a guy who you can give Roggenrola back to. Talk to him again to get the *McKrezzy Autograph*. Return to the PC and prep your full team for battle, then talk to McKrezzy for a fight.

He has a strong team but with no field, it shouldn't be too much to devise a strategy to defeat him. Note that his Staraptor can use a Z-Crystal.

For winning, you'll get *TM15 Hyper Beam*. 

Fly back to Apophyll and give Makuhita girl the autograph to get the *Headphones*, then go to Jasper Ward once more and give them to the Loudred girl. 

Fly to Lapis Ward and enter the house to the left of the Pokemart. You'll learn that the lady's son has been kidnapped! Head back to the North Peridot Alley and talk to the Jigglypuff guy once more. 

Fly over to Onyx Ward, prepare your team and save, then head to the rooftop.

Again, this is made harder by the fact that you can't heal. His Pokemon are pretty much all of the fast sweeper variety, meaning Trick Room or Tailwind support for a strong attacker may be the key here. Watch out for Bullet Punch on Scizor.

Once you win this gauntlet, fly back to Lapis Ward and put Vanillite into your party. Give it back to Eustace upstairs.

With all five Pokemon returned, return to DJ Arclight. Your prize will be the *Mega-Z Ring* - meaning we can now use the collection of Z-Crystals and Mega Stones that we've been building up. Of course, we will be getting more of these as well.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Complete the Mega-Z Ring Quest (+2 Arclight)

## Devon Corporation

With all of that content out of the way, we can finally proceed with the story! Return to the Grand Hall and talk to Ame. She'll task us with finding Arc, Victoria, and Adrienn.

Arc can be found outside his nightclub, Victoria in the Beryl Cemetery, and Adrienn outside their gym in Coral. Talk to Ame again once you've gathered them.

Enter the Underground Railnet and make your way to the room with the tracks that can be manipulated, then go into the second from the top path that leads to the room containing Aron - you'll know you're on the right track when you see an Absol. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Arclight you're ready to infiltrate Devon (+1 Victoria)
- Tell Arclight you're not ready to infiltrate Devon (-1 Victoria, -1 Arclight)

Talk to Arc and Victoria when you're ready, then go up the stairs and defeat the grunts! Note that your battle partner is decided by how many points with each character you have right now: you'll get Victoria if her score is at least two points higher than Arclights, and him otherwise.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Battle with Victoria in the Devon Basement (+1 Victoria)
- Battle with Arclight in the Devon Basement (+1 Arclight)

We can't get the Mega Stone in the corner quite yet. Up the stairs, head out the door into the main area and talk to the shining spot to get a *Radio Transceiver*. 

Up the stairs, you'll see an electric floor mat. If the tile is lit it is safe to walk on, otherwise, your non Ground-type Pokemon will take some damage when you step on it. You can use the A key to cycle between 3 sets of lit tiles.

That's all you really need to know to scale this building. Note that it is always possible to clear each floor without taking damage. Scale the building until you find yourself in a strange new place.

Heal and prepare your team as necessary, then proceed to the right.

Time for another fight with Victoria, the first in a while. You'll notice that she has a full and varied team this time, with lots of faster Pokemon but also a few bulkier options in the back. By now you're probably well acquainted with the Factory Field by this point so you can exploit that to win if you're stuck, or really just overwhelm her with a coherent singles strategy like Trick Room or setting up a sweeper.

Once you win, proceed to the next room at the top. Our A-button transceiver will still work in this area, so keep that in mind before you step on floor tiles that push you into unlit tiles. In this part of the dungeon we'll need to activate wall panels to switch the direction of the floortiles.

Activate the first monitor, then go up and activate the monitor above. Use the purple pads to go back down and reactivate the first monitor, then go left. You'll be forced up, so activate the nearby monitor but then go towards the right.

Once you enter the maxeline section, go up as soon as you are able, then go right. Heal if you want then go up, down, and right to reach another panel. Activate it.

Follow the long green path back to the left. Go down, left, and up as soon as you're forced to. At the top left corner of the area you'll see some familiar four-direction panels. Essentially you can just cram yourself in at the top over and over until you emerge at the top right. Just be cautious of the electric tiles you'll be launched onto.

You can turn off the electric tiles in the top right side of the area and proceed to the next section. Note you can buy Common Candies here if you need them.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Arclight you will fight (+1 Victoria, +1 Arclight)
- Tell Arclight you refuse (+2 Adrienn, -1 Victoria, -1 Arclight)

Either way you have to fight.

Time for our first fight with the DJ. This one has a bit more synergy with Factory Field out of the box thanks to four Electric-type Pokemon, plus he might change the field to Electric Terrain. Most of his Pokemon are fast and use Special Moves - Luxray being a counterexample to the latter and Ampharos being a counterexample to the former. I'm sure you can find a way to emerge victorious.

Note that we'll have a Light Shard later on in this room; since it can't fully knock you out, might as well ignore the tiles until then.

Enter the next room. Go as left as you can, then go up-left on the spinner. Follow the path up and right, then down and left. Next go up-left on the spinner from the right and activate the panel. Head to the right on the now rightward pointing green belt.

In this next area, go down-left on the spinner then loop back around above. Go down-right on the spinner this time, then go right twice, then left twice. You'll be able to grab the *PULSE Readout 1*. 

You'll be forced to go down into the spinner again, so do our loop trick again to get to the mazelike section once more. This time go right and up, and enter the spinner from the bottom to turn it yellow. Make your way back down and do the loop trick again. This time go down towards the bottom spinner and make your way around it a few times so that you end up on its right side. Go up from here until you can go left, then cross the spinner to use the monitor.

Sadly, you'll need to make your way all the way back through the spinners we've already visited to reach the top right corner of the room, this time going up and past the green belt. Activate this monitor then make your way back towards the left side of the room and go up when you can. Activate the two monitors beyond and follow the path to the stairs.

In the next room, may the spirit of Budew bless us all.

One more puzzle room for now. Follow the ropes to go up and pop out at the top on the left side, then go right back into the maze on the right side, going down, left, and up to the monitor. Follow the green rope to the right.

Use the spinner to reach the bottom, and use the Light Shard. Now I'd recommend saving for just in case you get shocked by accident. Anyways, this next section mostly plays itself: activate monitors as you reach them and dive into the cycle of spinners! Just to save you the agony, switch the Blue tiles to be on as you do this first part. Activate the final two monitors, prepare your team, and head up.

Time for the toughest fight in this section, in my opinion. ZEL has a decently well rounded core of Ice and Psychic-type special attackers, with various boosting held items to increase their potency and both Electric and Ghost moves to take advantage of both Factory and Short-Circuit. If a physical sweeper can get around Aurorus' sash and outspeed these four you'll be in a better position. Umbreon can be tricky however, as it will punish said physical attacker with Foul Play, heal itself with Wish and watch you die slowly of poison, or, *shudder* use Double Team to dodge your attacks. The icing on top of the cake for this fight is of course Magnezone, who has incredible special attack and two different types of field boosted moves that can destroy most Pokemon with ease. Of course, its biggest weakness in Ground is pretty much patched out thanks to it gaining the Levitate Ability.

To win this one, I recommend figuring out how to position yourself around Magnezone then working backwards from there. For example, if you want to take it out with Special Fire-moves, figure out how to get the sun out beforehand. If you want to use Earthquake, figure out how to get Gravity on the field or use Smack Down on it With only 70 base sweet and no EV's in this area, you'll find yourself likely able to outspeed, so placing one or two strong hits will really be the key. With a Pokemon to handle Umbreon and a physical sweeper or two to deal with the rest, you should be able to find a way through this one.

Talk to Zel in the bottom right corner, then head out, press the panel, and go left. Press the final panel of the area, and exit back into Reborn City.

## Silvon Scope Quest

With all that out of the way we can proceed to the next badge. There is one more quest that's opened up however that we can now do, so I'll cover that first. 

Reenter the actual Devon Corp. building in Obsidia, and make your way upstairs. Now the floor tiles will be going crazy and you can't control them. Honestly, I recommend grabbing some potions and just healing once we reach the top, since we will only have to deal with a single battle against 3 Pokemon. You can even challenge yourself to see if you can win with 6 Pokemon at 1 HP.

Past the guy at the top, you can pick up a *Devon Scope Model* as well as the *Electric Memory* and *TM81 X-Scissor*. 

Exit Devon and enter the actually-legitimate Silph building. Talk to the lady here to get the *Silvon Scope*! 

Fly on over to the Beryl Ward. We can finally expose Kecleon, so if you ever get stopped by one feel free to destroy it for being in the way. Enter Rhodochrine Jungle next and make your way down to the Underroot.

Head left underneath the waterfall, and continue going left until you run into *TM33 Reflect*!

**The Underroot**

|Water             |%  |Super Rod         |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Psyduck           |60 |Seaking           |40 |
|Lombre            |30 |Golduck           |40 |
|Seaking           |5  |Whiscash          |15 |
|Golduck           |4  |Dragalge          |5  |
|**Ludicolo**      |1  |                  |   |

Via following the path on the right side down, reach the large pool of water, then surf across. You'll find the *Blastoisinite* while you're here!

Climb the waterfall and grab the hidden *Rock Gem*. Prepare your team and talk to the invisible object at the bottom of the stairs.

So yeah, you'll have to fight 12 of these guys. They're just Kecleon so there's a good chance you can just one shot all of them, especially if you're using field-boosted Rock Slide. Be careful of their types changing and of course the seemingly endless uses of Fake Out and Sucker Punch, however.

**Purple Kecleon. Field: Cave Field**

    - Knock Off
    - Rock Slide

Of course, the cherry on top is that we have to fight a custom variant Kecleon as the final Pokemon in our 13v6 gauntlet. If you use a Fighting move on it, be careful as then it will have STAB with Drain Punch. As before if you're struggling, I recommend having two or three Pokemon specifically chosen to deal with the first fight and the rest saved up to deal with this one, just in case.

Past here you can get a hidden *Repel* as well as **Treecko**! 

Escape back to Beryl Ward. We can now notably access the backrooms of the library once more. Enter the left room and press the books in a familiar order. 

> That is, the order of the Arceus Statues in the Subseven Sanctum! So, Green, Red, Purple, Yellow, Blue, White

Enter the secret door here to get *TM30 Shadow Ball* as well as the *Catching Charm: Amethyst* which lets us catch Pokemon a bit easier. 

## Amaranth Badge

That's it for the side content, so head down to the Coral Ward and talk to Adrienn in their gym.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say you will become the champion (+1 Adrienn)
- Say you will not become the champion (-2 Adrienn)

They will then ask us to help out with a quest. It's optional but pretty easy and gives you some rewards, so why not. We have to search Reborn City looking for volunteers to help out with city cleanup efforts. There are 15 people we can get in total:

1. Coral Ward tunnel, brown-haired girl 
2. Obsidia Ward Park, blue-haired girl against the right wall
3. Onyx Arcade, yellow-haired guy wandering around on the right side
4. South Obsidia Ward, yellow-haired guy in the bottom left corner
5. Obsidia Alleyway, yellow-haired girl wandering around 
6. North Obsidia Ward, blue-haired glasses guy near the stairway
7. Lapis Ward, silver-haired girl in the park south of the PokeMart
8. Lower Peridot Ward, brown-haired guy wandering around east of the train station
9. Lower Peridot Ward, blue-hatted guy in the last building before the railnet
10. Lower Peridot Alleyway, black-haired girl
11. Blacksteam Shelter, black-haired guy on the couch on 1F in the bottom left corner
12. Jasper Ward, light brown-haired girl in the building to the left of the police station
13. Beryl Bridge, girl with blue ribbons on the left side of the bridge
14. Beryl Ward, tan-hatted guy left of the gym
15. Beryl Library, pink-haired child just above the entrance

Return to Adrienn after finding as many volunteers as you like. For finding at least 10, you'll get *Wise Glasses*! For finding all 15, you'll also get an *Ability Capsule* and a *Star Piece*! 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Find 10-14 volunteers (+1 Adrienn)
- Find all 15 volunteers (+2 Adrienn)

With that out of the way, it's time for our 14th gym battle.

    - Dazzling Gleam
    - Hidden Power
    - Wish
    - Nature Power

Adrienn battles us in Doubles, and their team is quite formidable. The fight will start on the Misty Terrain, which notably boosts their Dazzling Gleam offensively, and boosts the Sp. Def of all of their Pokemon by 1.5x. Combine this with two Pokemon that have Intimidate, and you'll be having a very hard time scoring knockouts. Granbull, Gardevoir, Togekiss, and the overlevelled Florges all function how you'd expect, but it's worth noting that Nature Power is activated via Prankster meaning Whimsicott can use Mist Ball with priority for free. You'll also notice that it has Tailwind - meaning it can change the field altogether to the Fairy Tale Arena, upon which all the Fairy-type and Steel-type attacks will be boosted and Whimsicott gets Prankster boosted Sacred Sword. Mega Mawile becomes even more of a threat as a result, as well.

Although this team on these fields is particularly stacked, you do have some options. For one, you can usually get a free boost on the first turn with Wide Guard thanks to Rock Slide/Earthquake and Dazzling Gleam being oft used moves. Consider changing the field at first to Corrosive Mist Field if you can - it will cripple their team, but you do have to use Clear Smog, Poison Gas, or Smog twice to make that work. What tends to work better though is leaning fully into the Fairy Tale Arena - you can blow the mist away yourself, then utilize boosted Steel moves to tear their team apart. Mawile is still a difficult threat to deal with, so if you can get around Mawile with some Steel attackers in the back, that may be a winning strategy.

For winning, you'll get the Amaranth Badge which boosts our cap to 85. You'll also get *TM99 Dazzling Gleam*! 

# Episode 17: Rust Thicker Than Water

Before we leave the gym, head to the top of the room. You'll find a hidden *Heart Scale* up here. Heal up if you need to - if you've progressed the quest up to this point, you can also talk to the left side of the flowery 'X' to find Corin Rouge! Battle him.

Return to the north side of Peridot Ward and talk to the Corin Rouge lookalike here. He will jump on a train to escape! Darn.

Head into Jasper Ward now to talk to the Police Chief, who will give you *Safety Goggles*. This massive quest quest will be over soon, I swear.

Head down to the Lower Peridot Ward. If we previously did the Onix quest and got the Hiker moved into a new house, we'll find him southeast of the Pokemon Center, and he'll give us a *Choice Band* if we joined the Aqua Gang, and a *Choice Specs* if we joined the Magma Gang. Sweet!

## Reborn Restoration Project 1

Anyways, head over to the Grand Hall. One of the guys behind the desk will be accepting donations for one of three projects.

We can only choose to fund one right now, then each of the other two as soon as we get the fifteenth and sixteenth gym badges respectively. You won't be missing out on anything in the long term depending on your choice here. If you want to make a more informed choice, read the following three subsections to see what the rewards are for each. 

As soon as you fully fund a project, you will be able to access the Grand Hall basement, so head down there. The bottom room on the right contains an *Adamant Mint*, a *Modest Mint*, and 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Next door you'll find 2 *EV Boosters*. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria in the Grand Hall basement (+1 Victoria)

If you enter the room at the very top and talk to the computer, you can get a *Lopunnite* and unleash Vulpix. Do it even if you don't like Mega Lopunny, trust me. There is one more quest we can start in the basement but I will cover it a bit later.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #1 (+1 Adrienn)

Anyways, the three options:

- [Affordable Living in Obsidia](#affordable-living-in-obsidia-project) ($60000)
- [Railnet Reconstruction](#railnet-reconstruction-project) ($100000)
- [Azurine Nature Center](#azurine-nature-center-project) ($80000)

### Affordable Living in Obsidia Project

Donate the $60000 to fund this project. Head down to the South Obsidia Ward once you complete it, you'll notice that the whole area has been revamped and the Slums are no more.

You'll be able to find Berries growing at the bottom, namely 2 *Lansat Berries*, 2 *Apicot Berries*, 2 *Petaya Berries*, 2 *Salac Berries*, 2 *Ganlon Berries*, and 2 *Liechi Berries*.  

Enter the building and talk to a guy behind the counter to get a *GUM Key*. You can also grab a *SOLICE Application* here, which we will need if we're doing the Magma Gang application quest.

Outside, talk to the girl up and to the right of the SOLICE office and agree to help with her quest.

Fly over to Jasper and enter the Malchous Forest Park. Talk to Sandy when you're ready.

Thanks to Lv. 100 Farfetch'd, lots of Forest Field boosted Cuts, and Sandy's team being weak to a lot of their moves and Rain making it harder to burn the forest down, this team might come as more of a challenge than you might expect, but some good physically defensive Pokemon will be helpful here.

These things are tough but a powerful Ground-type sweeper can probably do the trick. Once you win, Sandy will leave.

While we're down here, we can use the GUM Key that we got earlier. In the upper-right hand side of the Central Obsidia Water Grid you'll notice a locked door which we can now open. There is a puzzle beyond.

Essentially, we will need to move green sections of pipe into place so that they will complete the entire pipe circuit such that we end up in the upper right hand corner. This is a fun one to solve yourself, in my opinion, but here is a solution:

- In the bottom left corner, move the vertical pipe to the right one tile, into place.
- Head down from here and move the horizontal pipe up two tiles, into place.
- Head all the way to the right side, as far right as you can go without moving more pipes. Up from here, push a horizontal pipe up two, out of its place for now. 
- Grab *TM84 Poison Jab* here.
- From here go straight down. Push the rightmost horizontal pipe down two spaces, again out of its final place for now.
- Down from here, the left of the two vertical pipes can be pushed left two spaces, into place.
- The pipe to the right, the other vertical pipe, can be pushed two spaces left as well, into place.
- Up and slightly left from here you'll see a column of horizontal pipes. You can safely push the bottom-most one down four spaces, into place.
- Go up and push the second-from-the-bottom horizontal pipe down four tiles, into place.
- From here, up and left a few tiles is a vertical pipe. Pushing it four tiles would put it in place - push it six to the left for now to keep the corridor open.
- For each of the next three horizontal pipes in the column, push them down two tiles each, into their respective places.
- Next, make your way to the top-left side of the room. You'll notice two vertical pipes in a row at the top of the room, and below the right of the pair is another vertical pipe. Push this one left six times, into place.
- Down from here is a horizontal pipe you can push three tiles down, into place.
- The vertical pipe currently against the left wall is the first in a long row of vertical pipes. You can now safely push the second vertical pipe in this row left 8 times, into place.
- Down and right from here you'll find a horizontal pipe that can be pushed down four times, into place.
- Go straight up, and push the two vertical pipes along the top wall right four tiles respectively, into place for both.
- You can now safely push the third in the long row of vertical pipes left six spaces, into place.
- Go right and down. You'll see a horizontal pipe that you can push down four spaces into place. 
- Down from here you can push another horizontal pipe up two spaces, into place.
- Go up from here to return to the right side of the area. Up from the long column you'll find a U shaped alcove. Push the top-left vertical pipe two tiles right, out of place for now.
- You'll now be able to push the fourth vertical pipe in the long row left four tiles, into place. 
- Head down to the bottom right corner. Push the bottom right pipe up two tiles, into place. 
- To escape from here, go up and left. You'll notice that we previously pushed this vertical pipe two spaces left of its place to escape, so now we can push it to the right now two spaces, into place.
- Go up and back into the U-shaped alcove. Push the third and second vertical pipes from the right in the long row left four times respectively, into place.
- Of the two horizontal pipes remaining nearby, push the bottom one two times, into place.
- Push the final horizontal pipe down twice, into place.
- Push the vertical pipe in the top left corner left twice, into place.
- To escape the alcove, push the vertical pipe on the right side right twice. 
- Only two pipes remain out of place: push them down twice and left twice to finish the puzzle!

Talk to the computer in this area to get a **Goomy**! 

If you push the nearby vertical pipe left two times to re-enter the U-shaped alcove, you can talk to the pipe on the wall to return to the front of the room. 

With that out of the way, return to the Grand Hall basement. In the bottom right room, you'll find Sandy again. Talk to her in here... and after everything plays out, you'll get the *Waterium-Z*. Nice.

That's it for this restoration project.

### Railnet Reconstruction Project

Donate the $100000 to fund this project.

Essentially, this project funds a revamp of the Underground Railnet, so most of the things we can now get surround that. To start, head to Peridot Ward and head east into the Underground Railnet entrance under Opal Ward.

This area is the "Lost and Found". Always obtainable here are the *Assault Vest* and *Iron Plate*. If you realize that you missed out on getting any important items due to story progression such as Key Items, PULSE and Field Readouts, or TMs, check back here and they might just be here!

Next, enter the Devon Co. building and head down the stairs. The basement stairs will be blocked off, allowing us to grab the *Steelixite*! 

Enter the railnet building to the left of the Pokemon Center in Obsidia. This is now the Goldenrod Station of the functioning railnet - we will be visiting each station to see what's new there. We don't lose money buying tickets, but the subway isn't really any more useful than Fly, which we already have, so this is really just for exploration. 

Anyways, the Grandview Station is just the building we used to get to the desert previously, so there's nothing new there. The Ivyline Station is in the basement of the Onyx Trainer School, but we also aren't getting anything other than NPC dialogue there. Same for the Sunset Station, which is just outside in Northern Peridot Ward. Continuing the bad luck of no new content is the Heatherhill Station which brings us to the Jasper Ward Pokemon Center, and the Peony Station, which brings us to a random building in the Lapis Ward. 

The Kingsbury Station though? It brings us to a random building in Beryl Ward, but an NPC inside will give us the *Weakness Policy*. Insert world's longest "yea boi" here. But the Shantyport Station in Coral Ward? That's where the real reward is at. Bring an NPC in here a Probopass for an in-game trade for his **Togepi** egg. Nice.

I jest, but there is one more reward we can get out of doing this renovation project. In the Grand Hall basement, a nerdy NPC in the bottom left corner will tell us about an issue with the railnet renovation. Prepare your team as needed and head over to the Byxbysion Wasteland.

Via climbing through the building as we have before, hop down a ledge at the top to reach the upper left corner of the wasteland, and enter the cave. Go left, and follow the path into a building which contains a hidden *Telluric Seed* and *Exp. Candy XL*. Proceeding left, you can enter one final section of the underground railnet. Be prepared for a mini-gauntlet.

**Pokemon Refugees. Field: Cave Field**
- Aron, Lv. 20, @Custap Berry, Ability: Sturdy, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31

    - Earthquake
- Lairon, Lv. 35, @Custap Berry, Ability: Sturdy, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Earthquake

This fight exploits the cave field to collapse in on your Pokemon - instantly KO'ing most Pokemon. The Sturdy + Custap Berry combo makes it common for each Pokemon to get two attacks against you, so one collapse each. Without preparedness... that means you will lose all six of your Pokemon before the other fight! There are lots of strategies you can use to succeed here, however. Moldbreaker or multi-hit moves like Bullet Seed solve the Sturdy issue, allowing you to easily win. You can also use Power Gem constantly to change the field and prevent a collapse, or have a Bulletproof or Rock Head Pokemon do the whole fight since they are immune to the collapses. The Aron and Lairon will collapse themselves, so you could also just have something spam Wide Guard since you'll be safe from the collapse damage.

    - Rock Slide
    - Bulldoze

Possibly benefitting from the collapses your team suffer in the first battle, this doubles team goes all in on a similar strategy, this time with Rock Head to prevent any of the Aggron from taking collapse damage. With their Seeds, they'll gain defense, so your physical moves won't easily take them down in time. Wide Guard is even better this time, as your second active Pokemon can then focus on knocking out the Aggron. You can also just point-blank sweep them with two Pokemon running Aura Sphere, Focus Blast, Earth Power, Surf, and the like, so that's an option too. Again Bulletproof and Rock Head trivialize this fight.

Once you succeed in here, you can get the *Aggronite* and a hidden *Ultra Ball* and *Max Repel*. There are also encounters down here.

### Azurine Nature Center Project

Donate the $80000 to fund this project.

Surf on down to the Azurine Island once more from Coral Ward, and make your way to the building at the bottom. This will then be added as a Fly location, so you can easily get back here in the future.

Inside the building, you can get a *Toxic Plate*. You can also learn about the password *weathermod*. Upstairs, you'll find 5 *Exp. Candy XL*, as well as an *EV Booster* and *Max Ether*. If you didn't do the Chikorita event earlier, you can get it on the roof now.

In front of the building, a person will offer you an in-game trade: your Carnivine for a **Chimchar** egg. Nice.

Of course, the Azurine Island itself has been renovated as well, and we can get a few limited-choice Pokemon now!

Time to finally comb the Azurine Island for items one last time. We're also going to encounter more Foongus and Amoonguss in disguise, make sure you defeat or run from them to get them out of the way for a quest here.

This time I'll go left from the building to start. Grab the hidden *Big Mushroom* here, then another *Big Mushroom* to the left. Defeat the nearby Amoonguss, then head right. You'll find a hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and a non-hidden *Big Mushroom* below. To the right and down is another hidden *Big Mushroom* in a bush. Going up from here you can find, shocker, a hidden *Big Mushroom* left of the water.

Up the river is another hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and one out in the open to the left. Here you can meet the guy asking us to eradicate the Foongus and Amoonguss - once we finish we will return to him. To the left of him you'll find... a hidden *Blue Shard*! Surprise! Anyways, surf up and to the left from here to get a hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and a hidden *Common Candy* in a bush below. Another *Big Mushroom* is hidden on the same island where we once landed for the first time. Down and to the left you can get a hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Across the water on the largest island, you can pick up another *Big Mushroom*, and a hidden *Full Heal* to the right. 

Down the ledge and across the water, talk to the nature guy once more to get a *Rocky Helmet*. Sweet.

There is one more thing we can do for this restoration project. Fly over to the Grand Hall and go to the basement. In the top right hallway, you can talk to a guy who will tell you that they are looking for sample Pokemon at Azurine Island. Fly back there.

A lady on the left will give us 2 *Leaf Stones* and a mission: to donate a male and female each of Lurantis and Simisage. I recommend just breeding each using the incubator until you get the desired gender, then leveling the Fomantis up to get Lurantis and using the Leaf Stones on Pansage to get **Simisage**. Donate all four and return to the Grand Hall to get the *Grassium-Z*.

That's it for this restoration project.

The train station in Lower Peridot where we started our journey is now open. Inside, someone will give you the *Construction Application*. 

Make your way down to Seventh Street and find your corresponding gang leader. He'll ask us to give matching job applications to each of the members of their gang. Note that the blast powder salesmen will still sell to you on their respective jobsites. Anyways, the correct applications:

**Magma Gang Applications**

|Member     |Application        |
|-----------|-------------------|
|Darm       |Circus             |
|Nihil      |Nightclub          |
|Break      |Medicine           |
|Kriz       |Spyce              |
|Maxwell    |SOLICE             |

Note that if you haven't fixed the slums yet, you won't be able to finish this quest with the Magma Gang yet. For completing it all you'll be given **Oshawott** holding a *Choice Band*.

**Aqua Gang Applications**

|Member     |Application        |
|-----------|-------------------|
|Razzy      |Sweet              |
|Defacto    |Library            |
|Pierce     |Apophyll           |
|Mannie     |Construction       |
|Archer     |Silph              |

For completing this quest, you'll be given a **Litten** holding a *Choice Scarf*.

## Starter Egg Quest Part 1

Head into the Grand Hall basement and enter the middle room on the left side. Kanaya will task us with donating one egg of each of the 21 starter Pokemon! 

Regardless of choices, it is guaranteed that you will have been able to obtain Charmander, Squirtle, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko, Mudkip, Turtwig, Piplup, Tepig, Chespin, Fennekin, and Popplio, bringing our total to a minimum of 13 starters so far. You can search the page for these events if you'd like to get them now.

You may have Oshawott or Litten if you completed a gang sidequest, and you may also have Bulbasaur and Chimchar if you upgraded Azurine Island. Potentially you may also have one more starter, chosen at the very beginning, but for now I will just assume we have only the ones every player is guaranteed to have. Feel free to also donate these if you have them as well.

If you have the incubator, doing this breeding shouldn't take too much time, so get eggs of these 13+ Pokemon now. For donating 3, 6, 9, and 12, we'll get the *Reset Disc- HP*, *Reset Disc- ATK*, *Reset Disc- DEF*, and *Reset Disc- SPATK*. These will help us reset EV's to zero, helpful if you want to completely change up how you're running a Pokemon or get rid of junk EV's from the beginning of the game. As we get more (guaranteed) starters, we'll come back.

## Tourmaline Desert 

Make your way to the train station in Lower Peridot Ward, and take the train out to the Tourmaline Desert.

### Reshiram Route Taka Fight

If you already fought Taka at the WTC, skip ahead to the next section. 

If you didn't fight Taka at the WTC, now will be the time to fight him!

**Vagrant Scion Taka. Field: Desert Field**
- Chatot, Lv. 83, Ability: Keen Eye, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 4/0/0/252/0/252
    - Heat Wave
    - Nasty Plot
    - Hyper Voice
    - Encore
- Exeggutor-Alola, Lv. 77, Ability: Harvest, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/252/4/0/0
    - Nature Power
    - Dragon Hammer
    - Earthquake
    - Wood Hammer
- Klefki, Lv. 76, @Leftovers, Ability: Prankster, Bold Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/252/0/4/0
    - Substitute
    - Thunder Wave
    - Swagger
    - Foul Play
- Gliscor, Lv. 78, @Toxic Orb, Ability: Poison Heal, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/4/0/252/0
    - Stealth Rock
    - Earthquake
    - U-turn
    - Roost
- Komala, Lv. 77, @Leftovers, Ability: Comatose, Careful Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 248/0/8/0/252/0
    - Wish

    - Shell Smash
    - Acrobatics
    - Rock Slide
    - Earthquake

You'll notice that Taka's team is actually decently built for the Desert Field and sand, but again an Ice type can shatter him once Klefki goes down, so this fight probably won't be too terrible for you. As always, beware of a Shell Smash Minior sweep.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Taka that you will not keep on winning (+1 Taka)

Once you win, Taka will ask if you will let him join your party while you travel through the desert. There are gameplay pluses to doing this - he will heal your party after every fight and also has tons and tons of dialogue at the various subareas of the desert. However you will have to be careful that he doesn't knock out wild Pokemon you want to catch, though you can return later once he is no longer with you.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to allow Taka to join you.**

It's worth noting that refusing him here sends you down a different story path than the Reshiram and Zekrom routes, often called the "Hell Route" by the community. (I've never played this route so if you notice inconsistencies with the guide on Hell Route please let me know.)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Don't allow Taka to come with you in the desert (-3 Taka)

If he does join you, you'll lose points for leaving the desert while he's with you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Leave the desert while Taka is your partner (-2 Taka)

Once you make your choice, it's time to start exploring the desert...

### Greater Tourmaline Desert

If you want to just blaze through the story, head straight up in the desert until you reach an area with tons of trains, then complete the 1R253 Scrapyard section and proceed from there. There are tons and tons of actually good Pokemon and items that become available around the desert, so we'll spend a while exploring side areas for now.

So, the most dreaded part of writing this guide for me has finally arrived. I'll briefly explain the problem as well as my approach. Note that this all really doesn't matter much if you're not going out of your way to collect all the hidden items so you can just grab the items and Pokemon that you want and ignore the complications.

Essentially the greater part of Tourmaline Desert is really huge. That alone makes it hard to point to specific items. However there are actually 4 versions of this large map depending on where the desert's oasis currently is, which is randomly determined to start. Each of these four maps has its own set of hidden items as well. 

What I recommend is exploring the map you have landed on first without touching any of the oases - touching the light shard nearby the oasis will switch the map you're on. Doing this exactly 3 times will switch a DIFFERENT desert map between two versions, but we don't want to do this just yet. I will number the four maps 1, 2, 3, 4. Note that when you switch the map you're on you'll go to a random, different number, so to be sure you'll have to search for the oasis every time. 

To find the map you're on to start, you'll want to find your oasis. I provide images of each oasis below.

Oasis 1: On the upper/middle of the left side of the desert 
<img src="/assets/media/reborn/oasis1.jpg"/>

Oasis 2: Middle of the right side of the desert
<img src="/assets/media/reborn/oasis2.jpg"/>

Oasis 3: On the lower/middle of the left side of the desert
<img src="/assets/media/reborn/oasis3.jpg"/>

Oasis 4: Bottom of the right side of the desert
<img src="/assets/media/reborn/oasis4.jpg"/>

So, once you find the map you're on, now we can start getting things!

**Greater Tourmaline Desert**

|Super Rod         |%  |Water             |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Gastrodon         |44 |Mandibuzz         |65 |
|Shellos           |40 |**Gliscor**       |31 |
|Bruxish           |16 |Skarmory          |4  |

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Marowak           |4+ |
|**Cacturne**      |4+ |
|**Maractus**      |4+ |
|**Krookodile**    |4+ |
|Excadrill         |4+ |
|Dugtrio           |4+ |
|**Mandibuzz**     |4+ |
|**Darmanitan**    |4+ |
|**Heliolisk**     |4+ |
|Hippowdon         |4+ |
|**Skarmory**      |1  |
|**Scrafty**       |1  |

You'll also find many stationary **Exeggutor-Alola** around the desert.

You can encounter the same Pokemon on the various maps but at different rates. Thankfully, with the Magnetic Lure, you will be able to get whatever you don't already have easily.

For what it's worth, there are transitions from each map into two OTHER maps... which we will explore later. For now, keep in mind you don't want to go more north than these two images, the northwest and northeast borders:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/td_nw_border.jpg"/>

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/td_ne_border.jpg"/>

For now, don't enter any train cars yet, either.

First, I'll start by covering all the items that you can get only once and are available on all the maps. These are all generally worth getting and I'll point you roughly towards them. This is also a good time to get acquainted with the layout of the desert! For the sake of grabbing all these items, I will generally travel along the outside of the desert starting in the upper left corner, going counter clockwise along the outside of the desert, and finally grabbing whatever is in the center of the desert. Note that the large opening in a sand dune is Sugiline Cave, for the purposes of navigation. We'll explore there later.

Note that Taka often has something to say when you find these if he is with you.

**On all maps (only obtainable once)**

- In the top left corner up on a hill, you can get hidden 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. 
- As you climb down the top left hill, go slightly right as you head down. You'll see a *Stone Plate* on top of a hill.
- On the left side, you can hop across some blocks after defeating some Exeggutor-Alola to get *TM72 Volt Switch*! 
- In the bottom left corner of the desert, you'll be able to pick up a *Focus Sash*.
- On the very bottom-middle of the desert you can find 6 *Poke Balls*, one is hidden. Especially with Taka in your party, you may realize where these six balls came from...
- Hugging the right wall of the desert, you'll find a *Relic Copper*. 
- Past Sugiline Cave, hugging the right wall and going up, you'll find a *Max Elixir* near some dead trees.
- Up and to the right of the previous Max Elixir, you can find a hidden *Star Piece* in a rock.
- In the far northeast side of the desert, you can climb a sand dune to get onto a hill. Up and to the right you'll find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*.
- Pretty much in the center of the desert you'll see a section of vertical tracks. To the left of it, you'll see a broken statue. The main statue is too faded to read but the broken off gargoyle contains a hidden *Max Elixir*. 

Aside from all these items, each of the four maps has its own list of hidden items. These aren't even particularly worth searching for but for completeness I list them here.

**Map 1**

- On the hill where we found the 3 Exp. Candies, you can find a hidden *Magical Seed*.
- A hidden *Green Shard* is in a skull above the oasis.
- A hidden *Liechi Berry*, *Elixir*, *Red Shard*, and *Resist Wing* are nearby the oasis, in the upper left side of the map below the hill.
- East of the oasis in a dead tree is a *Telluric Seed*.
- Down from the oasis is a cactus, containing a *Leaf Stone*.
- Down from here, you'll eventually find the train station where we can return to Reborn City. Hidden on the station is *Red-Hots*.
- Straight west from the station is a *Blue Shard*.
- Down and left from here you'll see a tall pillar. Northwest of it, you can get a hidden *Common Candy* in a dead tree.
- North and slightly west of the pile of Poke Balls in the south desert, you'll find a hidden *X Speed*.
- Hugging the right side of the desert and going up, you'll see a small hill and a few patches of green. One contains a hidden *Great Ball*. 
- On the east side of the map, southeast of the Sugiline Cave, you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* in a desert rose flower. You'll know you're close when you see a bunch of desert rose trees.
- Straight west and slightly up from the previous item, you can find a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* between some palm trees.
- East of Sugiline Cave, you can find an *Exp. Candy XL*. 
- In the northeast side of the desert map north of where we previously found the hidden Star Piece, you can get a hidden *Rawst Berry*.
- Go straight up from here. You'll see a hidden *Full Heal* in a rock. 
- A decent bit west of the previous item, you'll find a hidden *Fire Gem*. 
- West of the here, you can find a *Dawn Stone* hidden in a rock.
- Back on the left side of the desert, straight east of the Stone Plate rock, under some tracks you'll find a hidden *Fairy Gem*.
- Going straight east from the Fairy Gem, past the fork in the tracks you'll see a large hill. On the other side is a skull containing a *Rare Bone*. 
- Down and to the left from here, you'll lose the train tracks but will eventually find them again in the sand. Left of here in a patch of green, you can get a *Dire Hit*.

**Map 2**

- On the hill where we found the 3 Exp. Candies, you can find a hidden *Chewing Gum*.

- Near the oasis on the right side of the desert, you can find hidden *Ability Capsule*, *Petaya Berry*, and *Carbos*. 
- In the northeastern corner of the desert you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball* and *Exp. Candy XL* in some rocks.
- Back down from here, slightly south and west from the oasis, you can find a hidden *Green Shard* in a skull by a hill.
- Left from the previous item you'll find train tracks. Follow these up to get a hidden *Purple Shard*. 
- Up and left from here you'll find a *Bug Gem* on top of a dune.

**Map 3**

- Just below the hill where we found the 3 Exp. Candies, you can find a hidden *Heart Scale* and *Red-Hots*.
- Following the left wall down, you can get a *Blue Shard* in a bush.
- Further down the left wall, nearby a desert rose patch you can get a *Calcium* and a *Dragon Gem*. 
- Follow the left wall down, on the other side of the bend in the wall you can find a hidden *Peppermint* near a dead tree.
- Nearby the oasis on the left side of the map, you can find a hidden *Relic Gold*, *Salac Berry*, and *Protein*.
- To the right and slightly up from the oasis, you'll find a hidden *Red Shard*.
- On the train platform down and to the right of the oasis you can get a hidden *Sun Stone*.
- Across the tracks from the station and slightly down you'll find a hidden *Red Shard* near a pillar.
- Slightly to the left of the pile of Poke Balls, you'll be able to find a hidden *Pop Rocks* under the tracks.

For some reason, just on this map, you can give a guy in the bottom right corner some Fresh Water in exchange for a new password: *gen5weather*. Anyways, back to the items:

- In the bottom right side of the desert, a rock will hide a *Nugget*. Just up from here in a patch of green is another rock containing a *Grass Gem*.
- Go up from here, passing between a small hill and a pillar. Up from here you'll find a desert rose containing a hidden *Ultra Ball*.
- Up from the Ultra Ball you'll see a bunch of bushes and cacti. Going right around the mountain, you'll find a hidden *Blast Powder*.
- Head way up from here. In a patch of green nearby a train track corner, towards the top right corner of the desert but a bit out from the wall, you can find a *Purple Shard*, and a *Poison Gem* just above here near a train car.
- Straight left from the Poison Gem, follow the tracks to reach a hidden *Stardust*.
- Just before you reach the top right corner of the desert, on your left is a mountain with a broken statue head beneath containing a *Steel Gem*. 
- Hidden in a pile of rocks in the north east of here is a *Nugget*, and a *Green Shard* to the northeast in a bush.
- Go straight left from this area into the area with many train tracks. In a rock pile you'll be able to find a hidden *Protein*.
- Continuing left from here, slightly up is a hidden *Water Stone* fittingly in a cactus.
- Going straight left from here once more, you'll find a hidden *Poke Snax* in a rock. 

**Map 4**

- On the hill where we found the 3 Exp. Candies, you can find a hidden *Common Candy*.
- Down from the hill, you'll find a bush containing another hidden *Common Candy*.
- Right from here, at the bend in the first track you'll find a rock containing a *Rock Gem*.
- Follow this track eastward. Below the first palm tree east of the bend, you'll find a hidden *Poke Ball*.
- Back at the bend to the left, go straight down. At the base of a medium-sized hill is a skull containing a hidden *Blast Powder*.
- There is a desert rose patch down and to the left from here, containing a hidden *Zinc*.
- Down from here you'll find a rock containing a *Cotton Candy*.
- Much further down the wall on the left side, in two rocks are a *Magical Seed* and *Salt-Water Taffy*.
- From the area where we got the Volt Switch TM, go straight east across the tracks to find a hidden *Iron*. 
- Slightly to the northeast of the pile of Poke Balls, you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*.
- Around the oasis in the bottom right corner, you can find a hidden *Sitrus Berry*, *Dusk Ball*, and *Relic Copper*.
- Just before the Sugiline Cave on the east side of the desert you'll find an area with a lot of cacti and bushes. Nearby are 3 hidden *Green Shards*.
- Straight up from here, follow the wall up and to the right. Near the dead trees, we can find a hidden *Purple Shard*. 
- Continue north and slightly left from here. In a green patch with bushes and a cactus you can find another hidden *Purple Shard*. Following the nearby tracks left, you'll find a hidden *Ultra Ball*. 
- Slightly up and to the right, you'll find a hidden *Burn Heal* in a statue head at the base of a mountain and a hidden *Big Pearl* in a bush to the right.
- In the northeast corner of the map, you'll find a hidden *Escape Rope* and *X Accuracy*. 
- Left from here, in a rock beneath a hill, you can find a hidden *Purple Shard*.
- Go left from here. Nearby the train cars, you can find a hidden *Blue Shard* in a rock.
- Continue going farther to the left. Just before the final vertical train tracks is a rock containing a hidden *Awakening*.
- Near the dead center of the desert, you'll find a small grove of trees near a train track. You'll find a hidden *Escape Rope*. 
- Up and left from here is a patch of green containing another hidden *Green Shard*.
- Follow the nearby tracks straight down to find a hidden *Fire Stone*.

Phew! That's everything we can grab in the Greater Tourmaline Desert. 

Note that if Taka is with you:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka in the Tourmaline Desert while he's with you (+1 Taka)

It's also worth noting that Taka has 36 different dialogues, some changing depending on your current location. If you talk to him in any location and he asks if you hate his father, you'll potentially get another point.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Taka you don't hate Solaris (+1 Taka)

### Northwest Tourmaline Desert

Next, we're going to explore the northwest side of the Tourmaline Desert. Thankfully there is only one map this time and it is relatively narrow. Make your way to the northwest side of the greater desert and start following the tracks up. As before, don't enter any of the traincars quite yet.

**Northwest Tourmaline Desert**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Marowak           |20 |
|Sandslash         |20 |
|**Lycanroc**      |10 |
|Krookodile        |10 |
|Excadrill         |10 |
|Dugtrio           |10 |
|Mandibuzz         |5  |
|Darmanitan        |5  |
|Heliolisk         |4  |
|Hippowdon         |4  |
|Skarmory          |1  |
|Gliscor           |1  |

From bottom to top ordered roughly you can find hidden: *Blue Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Green Shard*, *PokeSnax*, *Stardust*, *Fairy Gem*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Red Shard*, *Blue Shard*, *Purple Shard*, *Common Candy*, *Super Potion*, *Max Repel*, *Poke Ball*, *PP Up*, *Water Gem*, *Green Shard*, *Great Ball*, *Ghost Gem*, and *Potion*. 

You'll also notice a few non-hidden items: along the right side you can get a *Relic Copper* and a *Max Ether*. On the left side, past a dangerous trainer with F.E.A.R., you'll be able to get *TM08 Bulk Up*. 

Note that at the very top of the area we won't be able to move on thanks to an intense sandstorm - this is actually the region's border, so don't worry about trying to pass here as we will not be able to. You'll also notice a cave entrance in the top left corner - this is the Teknite Cave. I am gonna explore here later on, but you can jump to that section if you want to explore it now.

### Northeast Tourmaline Desert

Next, we're gonna checkout the final part of the outside desert area. Make your way to the upper right hand corner of the greater desert area we've explored so far.

So, there are also multiple maps going on in the Northeast Tourmaline Desert, but thankfully there are only two and it's pretty easy to tell where you are. If you haven't messed with any oases yet, you'll be on the dirty version, which I will explore first.

**Northeast Tourmaline Desert (Dirty)**

|Old Rod           |%  |Good Rod          |%  |Super Rod         |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Grimer            |100|Grimer            |60 |Muk               |100|
|                  |   |Muk               |40 |                  |   |

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Marowak           |20 |
|Cacturne          |20 |
|Maractus          |10 |
|Krookodile        |10 |
|Excadrill         |10 |
|Dugtrio           |10 |
|Mandibuzz         |5  |
|Darmanitan        |5  |
|**Lairon**        |4  |
|Hippowdon         |4  |
|Skarmory          |1  |
|Drapion           |1  |

Roughly from bottom to top, you can find a hidden *Repel*, *Calcium*, *Blue Shard*, *Stardust*, *Purple Shard*, *Pop Rocks*, *Great Ball*, *Red Shard*, *Elixir*, *Purple Shard*, *Blue Shard*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Poke Ball*, *Shiny Stone*, *Green Shard*, *Pearl*, *Telluric Seed*, and *Rare Bone*. 

At the wasteland at the top you can get *TM36 Sludge Bomb*!

With this map fully explored, now we can finally proceed to mess with the oases. Essentially, as explained before, each time you touch a light shard at a mirage, the map will switch to a different one. If you've done this any multiple of three times, the map on the northeast will transform from the dirty map to the clean map. So, go search for three mirages, grab the hidden items on the respective Greater Tourmaline map you land on if you'd like, then return here to explore the Mirage version.

**Northeast Tourmaline Desert (Mirage)**

|Super Rod         |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Gastrodon         |44 |
|Shellos           |40 |
|Bruxish           |16 |

|Cave              |%  |Water             |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Marowak           |20 |Mandibuzz         |60 |
|Cacturne          |20 |Gliscor           |31 |
|Maractus          |10 |Sigilyph          |5  |

|Excadrill         |10 |                  |   |
|Dugtrio           |10 |                  |   |
|**Vibrava**       |5  |                  |   |
|Darmanitan        |5  |                  |   |
|Heliolisk         |4  |                  |   |
|Hippowdon         |4  |                  |   |
|Skarmory          |1  |                  |   |
|**Flygon**        |1  |                  |   |

Again roughly from bottom to top, you can find a hidden *Iron*, *Red Shard*, *Green Shard*, *Great Ball*, *PokeSnax*, *Purple Shard*, *Elixir*, *Red Shard*, *Oran Berry*, *Blast Powder*, *Aspear Berry*, *Repel*, *Magical Seed*, *Poke Ball*, and *Custap Berry*. By surfing you can find hidden *Star Piece*, *Full Restore*, and *Dusk Stone*.

Before we enter the tower, there's another thing we can do out here. Surf around the back of the tower. There's a hidden stairs directly behind the tower we can use to get onto the mountainside. Follow this path to get a hidden *Stardust*, *Swift Wing*, and *Blue Shard*. 

You can pet Leafeon here for the Eeveelution petting quest. By defeating the Lv. 100 Exeggutor-Alola in the pot, you can talk to the pot to get the *Dragonium-Z*! There is also a top tier NPC and shop here.

**Marcello's Lemonade Shop**

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Lemonade*             |$350       |

After buying as much lemonade as you can carry if you'd like, head into the Mirage Tower.

## Mirage Tower

Welcome to the Mirage Tower, one of my favorite side areas in the game. We can either climb the tower or access the secret basement. I will go with the basement first.

To reach the basement, you'll need to smash every mirror along the top wall with Rock Smash. Doing this will hurt your party members, so healing them if you don't have Taka may be smart. Speaking of Taka:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka in the Mirage Tower while he's with you (+1 Taka)

Anyways, head through the opened door to the basement.

|Excadrill         |1  |

This is a dark, mazelike room. To progress you will sorta have to do a clockwise spiral outward, grabbing items as you go. Hidden in the basement you can find a *Super Potion*, 2 *Red Shards*, *Purple Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, *Green Shard*, *Cotton Candy*, *Ghost Gem*, *Great Ball*, and *Heart Scale*.

Towards the top of the area, you'll notice a **Mimikyu** that you can battle and catch! Nearby it, you'll find the *Poison Memory* and a hidden *Elemental Seed*.

Return to the Mirage Tower proper. Next, we will climb the tower, solving puzzles as we go! Note that your actions on the block will affect the other, but the blocks won't move if pushed against a barrier. I will put the solutions in invisible text.

Puzzle 1:

Puzzle 3:

Puzzle 4:

You'll need to go back the way you came and go up at the fork in the stairs to progress.

Puzzle 5:

To progress from here, go up through the hole in the glass that will be created.

Puzzle 6:

Follow the path back from here... into the Tourmaline Desert once more?

|Skarmory          |1  |                  |   |

So, we can get another legendary here, if you can call it that!

Although you might be tempted to head back into the tower, try heading down from here...

Following this path will lead us to the top of Mirage Tower! Here we can pick up the *Normalium-Z*, *TM04 Calm Mind*, and of course, **Honedge**. Excellent rewards, and I recommend training this thing up right away if one of your team members is falling off, as Aegislash is one of the best Pokemon in this game!

That's it for the Mirage Tower for now.

## Sugiline Cave

Next, I'll take us to the Sugiline Cave. Head over to the east side of the greater desert and hug the right wall until you see a massive opening in a dune, then head in.

Essentially Sugiline Cave has two floors: 1F, and B1F. Falling down a sand vortex on 1F leads you to B1F, but falling down a vortex in B1F brings you all the way back to the beginning of the cave. For this reason, I recommend quick-saving like crazy in here so you don't waste time and repels getting back to where you are. 

On this first map, you can get a hidden *X Sp. Atk*, *Pop Rocks*, *Blue Shard*, and *Ultra Potion*. Drop down the bottom-left vortex first to B1F.

Grab the hidden *Elemental Seed* and *Big Mushroom* and take the ladder to 1F. 

On this map you can get a hidden *Elemental Seed*, *Red Shard*, *Great Ball*, and *Ultra Ball*. Step into the bottom-left most vortex to get a *Max Elixir*. Unfortunately from here we have no choice but to step into the vortex to return to the front of the dungeon, so take the bottom left vortex and follow the path to where we were before.

This time, take the vortex up and slightly right from the pot that contained the Great Ball. In this area of B1F you can find a hidden *Cheri Berry*, *Protein*, and *Ether*. Again, we'll have to jump in a vortex from here and return to the 1F level above.

This time, take the top right vortex, then climb the ladder in the area you land in. Up here, pick up the *Draco Plate* and hidden *Super Repel*. Again jump into the vortices and make your way back to 1F. 

Jump in the top left vortex this time. You can find a hidden *PokeSnax* in this room. Void out and return for the final time, in this section of the dungeon, at least!

Finally, jump into the vortex on the left side of the pot. Climb the ladder at the top of the rocky path.

In this next room, you can find a hidden *X Speed* and *Dark Gem*. Be extra careful here, as all vortices but the correct one will immediately yeet you back to the starting point. The correct one is the one in the middle of the top three, so head down it.

On B1F, be careful to not fall in again and pick up hidden *Telluric Seed*, *Super Potion*, and *Red Shard*, then climb the ladder on the right side.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* and proceed into the room on the right. Push the button in the Arceus statue to finish the left section of the cave! Make your way back to the entrance.

Next, step into the bottom right vortex in the entry room. 

In this room, you can get a hidden *Carbos*, *Pecha Berry*, and *Blue Shard*. Climb the ladder at the top.

In this next room, you can find 2 hidden *Elemental Seeds*, *PokeSnax*, and *Green Shard*. Jump into the vortex on the middle of the right side of the room, below a cactus. Pick up a *Link Stone* then void out and return to the previous room.

Next, jump into the middle of the top three vortices. Be careful here as you grab hidden *Ice Heal*, *Antidote*, and *Star Piece*. Climb the ladder on the left side and push the button in the Arceus statue. Return to the front of the dungeon.

Next, enter the vortex at the very top of the entrance room. Down here you can find a hidden *X Speed* and *PP Up*. Climb the ladder to get a *Magical Seed* and hidden *Star Piece*, then return to the front of the dungeon.

Finally, hop down the vortex straight up from the cave's entrance. Here, you can find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Blue Shard*, *Great Ball*, and *Common Candy*.

In the next room, grab a hidden *Genius Wing* and *Exp. Candy XL*, then proceed into the next room. You might wanna save here - all the Garchomp statues can come alive and fight you!

While a fast Ice type can make this not really a problem, they can wear most teams down quickly. Technically you can actually get through this room without having a single battle with very careful movement, so figure out how to get through however you like.

Explore this room. You can find 2 hidden *Red Shards*, *Elemental Seed*, *Ultra Ball*, *Great Ball*, *Blast Powder*, *Purple Shard*, and *Iron*. At the top, you can get *TM71 Stone Edge*! 

Talk to the Arceus statue at the top, and vortices will show up all around. Hop down any one of them to reach Sugiline Ruin B1F.

On this floor, you can find the *Medichamite*, an *Impish Mint*, *Bold Mint*, and 3 *Exp. Candy XL* as well as a hidden *Super Potion*, *Escape Rope*, 2 *Green Shards*, *Dragon Gem*, and *Muscle Wing*. 

You can also interact with the basins around the area and put in some snax. Head up the ladder, then jump down the corresponding vortex above that basin. You'll be able to battle and catch **Gible**! Very nice. Head out of the dungeon via a nearby vortex and return to the desert.

## Teknite Cave & Teknite Ridge

Next, we're going to take a trip to the Teknite Cave in the northwest corner of the Tourmaline Desert. You can save some time by having Pokemon in your party with Power Gem, a ground-shaking move (TM Bulldoze works), and Tailwind, but we can proceed without these moves by having wild Pokemon use them in battle. Enter the cave.

As in the other areas:

In the first room, grab the hidden *Tamato Berry* then proceed to 2F. In the next, grab the *Mountain Field Readout*, *Dawn Stone*, and hidden *Magical Seed*. 

You'll notice that the "stones shimmer with light" when you enter. As we know by now that means we have to change the field somehow to proceed - we'll need to transform the Cave Field into Crystal Cavern Field. The only way we can right now is via use of Power Gem - note that wild Carbink can use this move, so if you don't have it on you, you can just encounter one and hope it uses this move. After the cave is transformed, use the red crystal to create a rock smash wall, and proceed to 3F. 

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* then transform the field to Crystal Cavern. Use the green crystal to remove the obstacle. Note that we won't be able to proceed - you'll need to use Bulldoze, Earthquake, Magnitude, or Fissure to switch back to Cave from here. If you don't have these moves, wild Sandslash, Dugtrio, and maybe others should have one of these moves. Once the field is changed and a gem is destroyed to clear a path, move to the top of this room then switch to Crystal Cavern once more. Use the crystal, smash the wall, and proceed to 4F.

Switch to Crystal Cavern, then remove the obstacle. Grab the hidden *Iron* and *Potion*. Switch back to Cave and grab a hidden *Burn Heal* at the top and *Mental Herb* at the bottom. Enter the bottom left room to re-enter 3F, grab the hidden *Synthetic Seed*, and proceed to the room on the left.

Surf to a hidden *Repel*. Switch to a Cave Field and use the blue crystal at the bottom to cross the water. Grab a hidden *Magical Seed* and proceed. Grab the *Buginium-Z* and the hidden *Blue Shard*. Return to 4F, this time going through the top left exit.

Pushing the strength boulders out of the way, hop across to the bottom left corner to get a hidden *Relic Copper*. Hopping to the top right, you can get a hidden *Health Wing*. Finally, hop to the top left to re-enter Teknite Cave. Grab a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and proceed to the next Teknite Ridge map.

On this map, you can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Roseli Berry*, *Potion*, *Escape Rope*, *Quick Ball* as well as 3 *Exp. Candy XL* and *TM75 Swords Dance*. Hop across some rocks to the left to get a hidden *Nugget* and the *Mawilite*! 

Return to the 4F map with branching paths, this time going up and right. On this map, you won't be able to fully explore as is, but by using Tailwind in a battle, you can now jump three horizontal spaces instead of two! Wild Pidgeot and Talonflame may use this move if you don't have it on you.

Hop your way to the next by the entrance to get the *Pidgeotite*. Hopping to the right from here you'll find the *Ice Memory*. Back nearby the entrance, hop slightly up and left to get a hidden *Hyper Potion* in a rock. Hop to the landmass to your right, and grab the hidden *Leppa Berry*. Hugging the top left as much as possible, hop across to the top-left corner of the map. Jump down just one ledge, then go right. Hop to a nearby rock for a hidden *Level Ball*, then grab the *PP Max* at the top.

Hop back to the central landmass, this time climbing a bit higher and hopping to the right. It's a bit hard to spot, but to proceed, you'll need to hop at the top left corner of the next landmass up and around to the next landmass at the top. Hopping down one ledge, go right and hop up and around. Follow this path to the top of the hill to get a **Rowlet** egg!

That's it for the Teknite Range, so feel free to fly out of here back to Lower Peridot if you want.

## 1R253 Scrapyard

If you have Taka with you and want him to stay with you for more points, conversations, and free heals, save this area for later, as once we get a fair bit in, he will leave our side.

As in the other areas:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka while he's with you in the 1R253 Scrapyard (+1 Taka)

Time to proceed to the next story area! You've probably seen a large area surrounded by tons of traincars in the central northern desert - this is our destination. Actually, to start, make your way to the Northwestern Tourmaline Desert to start. 

At the bottom right of this map but before you enter the Greater Tourmaline map, you will find a entrance to a train car. Go through this train car, and you'll emerge in the 1R253 Scrapyard!

Go straight up and grab the *Max Repel*. Towards the bottom of the area you'll see a green train with an open door - getting inside, we can use it to move forward, unless there is a Rock Smash boulder on the track. This puzzle is a pretty fun one in my opinion, so feel free to skip ahead until the next section if you'd like to try to solve it all yourself. 

So, use this train to go forward, pushing a different train onto some vertical tracks. From here, go straight up and into a train car. Follow the path through many different cars until you emerge once more. Smash the rock then backtrack through this train. Going down then left and back up, you can now use the train at the top to go right. 

From here, you'll be... railroaded... into going to the right and down. Once you hop down a horizontal ledge look to the right to smash a rock, then continue down your path. Finally, you'll be spit out in the main area of the scrapyard. If you enter the train cars at the very bottom, you can return to the Greater Tourmaline Desert, so if you need to fly out of here to heal, that's where you'll return. 

Head up and enter the nearby train, then hop down the ledge to the left. Smash two rocks below and to the left. Continuing left and down, enter the train. It will only go a few tiles, so head right from here to enter the next train. On top of the hill, grab the *Max Repel* and *Steel Memory*, then jump down. Head left around this hill and smash the rock, then go back down below the hill, and enter the nearest green train to the right. This will drop you off near another green train, which you can now ride west.

From here, go down as far as you can, then head right. We are going to exit this area via the train cars at the bottom. Back on the outside of the scrapyard, head to the right, and you'll see another traincar entrance to the scrapyard. Use this entrance to re-enter the scrapyard.

This path will take you to a train, which you can now ride all the way left. Once it bumps a train out of the way, go down from here and enter the vertical train to go up to enter a new map!

Grab the hidden *Dire Hit* and *Synthetic Seed* on the map. Enter the horizontal train in the bottom left, then climb the hill. Hop down the ledges to climb down the hill. Follow the new path far to the southwest to get 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, then jump in the nearby train and ride it left. Head back to the top right and take the vertical train for a ride downward!

Grab the hidden *Big Mushroom* and enter the nearby train car. Follow the path through these cars until you emerge once more into the outside air.

This area is sometimes referred to as Train Town and thankfully you'll be able to fly here in the future. Taka leaves your party here as well.

Around this area, you can pick up a *Max Repel* as well as hidden *Common Candy*, *Purple Shard*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Aspear Berry*, *Red Shard*, *Poke Ball*, *Purple Shard*, and *PokeSnax*. 

If Taka is with you, he will take a rest and lie down in a train car on the bottom right side of the area. Talk to Europa before you follow him if you like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Europa Taka is your boyfriend (+1 Taka)

You can talk to the residents of the Train Town and learn about them. In the bottom left train, if you've been to Mirage Tower, you'll see a warp that will bring you there. Handy.

Depending on the time of day, Bouffalant Bill will be either outside or in a train car on the upper right side of the area that contains a healing machine. He will sell us some stuff.

In a train car at the top of the area you can access a PC and meet Stephoscope. Talking to her twice after visiting Teknite Ridge, you'll be given the *Houndoominite*. Excellent.

More importantly than all that though... by talking to *him* on the east side of Train Town, we can finally finish *the* quest. You know the one - we started it 5 minutes into the game when the fisherman and his buddy sold us a Pokemon and then stole it from us. We've watched our Pokemon by rights get taken by a guy in the slums, stolen by both the Magma Gang and Aqua Gang, and taken into the possession of an associate of the slimy Seventh Street Pokemon salesman. Next it was stolen by Corin Rouge, who had three of his associates bamboozle us long enough to escape into the desert. We paid the gold price for the Pokemon sixteen episodes ago. But now it's time to pay the iron price by defeating Corin Rouge once and for all.

This cruel thief has a Z-move and some Pokemon with Desert Field synergy, but they shouldn't be too tough to take out. Just be careful of the sixth, who can easily sweep your team if you aren't careful.

By defeating him we can finally get our hands on our birthright. We get **Magikarp**.

Of course I jest, but Gyarados is one of the strongest Pokemon in the game, so it is indeed worth it.

Make your way out of the Train Town via the train car at the bottom. In the next area you can get a hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *X Speed*. You'll notice an entrance to a train car in the top right corner, which is where we'll go to continue the story. For now there are a couple goodies in the scrapyard that we couldn't access before, so I'll get those first.

Down and right from here you can find the *Amulet Coin* and a hidden *Blue Shard*. Left of here you'll find a *Max Repel* and a hidden *Heart Scale* and *Green Shard*. Enter the train at the end of the path, picking up the *Exp. Candy XL* and *Star Piece* in the pit. Climb out via the railroad tracks, and follow the track that this train just took up to get 
*TM19 Roost*. 

Next, head down from here, then left as soon as you're able. Make your way to the top left corner of the area, where you'll now be able to pick up a *Max Elixir*.

That wraps up all we can get in the scrapyard, so fly back over to Train Town, exit out the bottom and enter the train car in the top right corner of the next area.

Follow the path through a ton of train cars until you emerge... what?

## Once Upon a Somewhere

You'll find yourself in a new location entirely. Not what you expected, huh?

**Once Upon a Somewhere / Once Upon a Waste of Time**

|Land              |%  |Headbutt          |%  |

It seems like this first map is an infinite maze - it essentially is. Try biking in random directions until you see a set of stairs ascending upwards, then take those. You'll see them eventually, I'm sure.

On the next map, you can find a hidden *Green Shard* and *Sitrus Berry*. Proceed into the castle. Here, you'll have to fight some Knights as you proceed. 

You'll wake up in a tower. Read the placards at each floor as you go up or down the stairs until you see a pile of books leading out of a window.

On the exterior of the tower, climb the vines. On the left at the top you'll see the *Dragon's Den Field Readout*. As you head right, Titania will talk to you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Titania you trust her, while you have >= 0 points with her (+1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you trust her, while you have < 0 points with her (-1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you don't trust her, while you have >= 0 points with her (-1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you don't trust her, while you have < 0 points with her (Titania's total becomes *f(c)*), where *f(c) = min(0, c + 4)* and *c* is the current number of points you have with her.

Complicated, but anyways, she'll give you the *Sapphire Bracelets*. Proceed right.

Grab the hidden *Super Potion*, *Ultra Potion*, and non-hidden *Dragon Fang* in the Belly of the Beast, then prepare for a battle. Depending on your choices, it'll be different.

If you're on, well, Reshiram Route, you'll get this: 

The Legendary Dragon. Field: Dragon's Den
- Reshiram, Lv. 90, @Elemental Seed, Ability: Turboblaze, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/0/252/4/0
    - Blue Flare
    - Roost
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Solar Beam

Whereas, surprise, if you're on Zekrom Route, you'll get this:

The Legendary Dragon. Field: Dragon's Den
- Zekrom, Lv. 90, @Groundium-Z, Ability: Teravolt, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/4/0/252/0/0
    - Bolt Strike
    - Roost
    - Outrage
    - Earth Power

At least now you know why the routes are named as they are. Win your conquest with whatever clever tactics or raw strength you need to slay a dragon, and proceed.

Pick up the hidden *Health Wing*, *Revive*, and *Lava Cookie* beyond, and watch the scenes play out at the top of the room.

Head up at the top to Titania's arena! 

## Alloy Badge

Before starting the battle, you can jump into the blue hole at the top and go left from here if you want a shortcut to Train Town for some prep - there's a good chance your team won't be good enough for the upcoming gym fight. Anyways, up from here is a hole you can jump into to return to the tower. Along the way back to the gym, you'll even find a *Rare Candy*!

    - King's Shield
    - Shadow Sneak
    - Swords Dance
    - Sacred Sword

The Fairy Tale arena boosts Fairy and Dragon moves, along with giving Fire moves a Dragon sub-typing. It also boosts Steel moves and gives them effectiveness on Dragon. Defensively, Steel types already resist Fairy and Dragon, so with the nerf to Fire moves, Titania definitely uses the type best positioned on this field. Instead of Sandstorm, this fight is accompanied by Hail, which allows her Sandslash to outspeed and set up Aurora Veil if it likes. Past that, Empoleon, Excadrill, and Mega Scizor are all very strong steel types with lots of coverage, the latter even having a very nasty Technician, field boosted, priority Bullet Punch, and Excadrill a nasty boosted Smart Strike. Klefki is very annoying as usual thanks to prankster Paralysis on command but also humorously can sweep you with Calm Mind and boosted Draining Kiss to heal. As you'd expect, her Aegislash five levels above the cap with insane boosts on three of its moves is no slouch - bulking up when it uses King's Shield and getting stronger when it attacks, priority or otherwise. On top of this, Excadrill and Aegislash have Magical Seeds, protecting their Pokemon for a turn, lowering your stats if you try to attack them, and allowing them each to set up a +3 Swords Dance. Scary! (just know that in previous versions the seed would also boost Attack for free...)

There are a good number of strategies that remain for you to use, thankfully. A Pokemon with Protect, Swords Dance, and a move like Earthquake or Brick Break can probably sweep through most of the team with a bit of speed control support as long as they can live a priority attack or two. There are a ton of abilities and moves that allow you to gain Defense, so if you're able to deal with Klefki and Empoleon there may be a working strategy involving going all in on Defense boosts to neutralize her attack boosts and such. There are also some boosts to attacks and abilities: Mystical Fire / Magician and Sparkling Aria / Oceanic Operetta do get boosted here if you want to try to sweep with your starter Delphox or Primarina! Queenly Majesty gives a boost to damage, combine this with its natural ability to cancel out Bullet Punch and Shadow Sneak, and Tsareena may end up being very helpful here. The Magical Seed giving a free turn can also be used by you, with the added bonus of you being able to hard switch in to a contact move to force a stat lower on one of her party members if need be. If you're really stuck, you can literally consider going 6 Magical Seeds held to grant yourself 6 free turns - this is what I did once upon a time to win this fight with a Fairy monotype.

For winning, you'll get the *Alloy Badge*, boosting the level cap to 90. You also get *TM91 Flash Cannon*.

Jump down the pit at the top and go left to return to Train Town.

## Reborn Restoration Project 2

Pokemon Reborn Episode 17 actually came out and allowed players to get two badges, so there is still a bit of content left in the chapter. First is some optional content.

If you haven't yet gotten the Mega-Z Ring, the quest will now be opened back up if you'd like to complete it now. Head over to the Nightclub and talk to Arclight to get started, then checkout the respective [section of the walkthrough](#mega-z-ring-quest) for steps. 

Head over to the Grand Hall. Now that we've beaten Titania, we can fund another restoration project.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #2 (+1 Adrienn)

If you'd like to complete another one, the choices and corresponding references are here:

- [Affordable Living in Obsidia](#affordable-living-in-obsidia-project) ($60000)
- [Railnet Reconstruction](#railnet-reconstruction-project) ($100000)
- [Azurine Nature Center](#azurine-nature-center-project) ($80000)

There is one more thing we can do before continuing: fly over to Calcenon City.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in Calcenon City after defeating Titania (+1 Hardy)

## Torrent Badge

With that out of the way, we can pretty much head right to the next gym. Fly to the Celestinine Cascade and enter the Fiore Mansion. You can pet Vaporeon for that quest, and talk to Julia for some A+ gym advice. Enter the gym room at the back.

### Reshiram Route: Fiore Gym

If you're on the Zekrom Route, skip ahead to the next section.

Unfortunately this gym's layout is super confusing, but I will guide us through. For now, dive down here and then make your way down at the three-way fork. Thankfully this way is very linear, so go straight. Once you have two waterfalls to choose from, go up the left to get a hidden *Heart Scale* then proceed. 

Surface in the gym room, then talk to Amaria. Use the warp to return to the front of the gym, for it's time to look for Amaria. You'll need to find her three times.

This time, head right at the underwater fork. When you surface, you can get a hidden *Full Restore*. The path from here is linear. When you surface next, you can get a hidden *Ultra Potion* on the left. Continuing, when you encounter a fork, go down instead of left. Amaria #1 is encountered in the next room, on the left side of the loop.

Continue into the next room in the bottom right. Going right at the fork will lead you to an *Elemental Seed*. Follow the path through, surfacing. Continue to follow the path at the next dive spot. At the fork, go left instead of right.

Exit this next room at the top and surface to get a *Max Revive*. Dive back down, this time exiting the large room in the southeast exit. Exit this room on the northeast side.

Go left at the first fork to reach the *Slowbronite*! Back at the fork head straight up, and then left as soon as you can to surface. There's a hidden *Ability Capsule* at the base of the waterfall. Grab it, then head back up the waterfall and dive down into the room we were just in. In the southeast is Amaria #2. From here, head into the room we previously visited in the southwest corner.

You'll find Amaria #3 in the pocket towards the center of the room.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Find Amaria #3 and say no (-4 Amaria)
- Find Amaria #3 and say yes (-3 Amaria)

After the scenes that play out here, you'll end up in the Fiore Mansion. Prepare yourself, then return to the gym when ready.

Take the teleporter to the gym arena and talk to Amaria. 

Amaria will ask you if you want to battle in Singles or Doubles - but she'll actually challenge you in the format opposite of what you request!

Surprise, the Water gym leader has a team built for the Water Surface and Underwater Fields. These fields, especially the latter, are pretty suffocating for most Pokemon, drastically slowing them down and allowing Amaria to hit hard with Whirlpool, Dive, etc. On the surface Electric-types and maybe Grass-types can get away with their usual tricks somewhat, although with Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Swampert you won't have the easiest time sweeping and the group all have lots of coverage, and on Reshiram route only, the latter can Mega Evolve! These three also have Swift Swim, which is always on for these two fields. Wishiwashi doesn't stop schooling, so keep that in mind. Lapras with its seed and Curse can set up on you and is also immune to status conditions on these fields, so you might be in for a shock if it sets up and is unkillable. This team isn't super complicated, just hits hard and is prepared to deal with most of what you throw at it.

You can consider trying to change up the field - Murkwater Surface can wear down her Pokemon with chip damage... although she can change it back with half of her team's Whirlpool. Icy Surface can allow you to actually use hazards and ignore all the speed shenanigans... although she can change it back with Swampert's Earthquake or two uses of Kingdra's Scald. You can also create a team specifically for one of the fields. Raichu-Alola for example does great on the Water Surface, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokemon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokemon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water-type moves. Especially Underwater, your own Water types with Swift Swim can be very useful here as well - if you can get past her Kingdra, your own Ludicolo can be particularly good here. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.

    - Protect
    - Rest
    - Perish Song
    - Surf

Amaria's Doubles team is built well around the Water Surface and the spread of Surf to your party while taking little/no damage from the spread to her party members, as Vaporeon and Seismitoad both have Water Absorb. This means your own Water-types will potentially have a harder time on this fight than the singles fight. With Primarina'and Blastoise's coverage, Lanturn to check your Electric-types and no-status condition Lapras to potentially ruin a sweeper's day thanks to Perish Song and Protect, she has a pretty bulky team that can deal with lots of teams you attempt to use. On Zekrom Route only, her Blastoise can mega-evolve, making its Aura Sphere a bit stronger and raising its stats somewhat. 

As with the singles fight you may consider transforming the field. Murkwater Surface will deal passive damage to her team members each turn... but Lanturn and Blastoise may change it back with Whirlpool. Icy Field helps alleviate the speed issues, boosts, etc... but can be changed back with Seismitoad's Earthquake. The latter is potentially a good route to go with if you have a fast special-attacking Grass type who can one shot Seismitoad on turn 1. You can also try using the Water Surface or Underwater to your advantage - without Swift Swim on any of her Pokemon, bringing some Swift Swimmers of your own might let you outspeed and crush her with the right setups. Raichu-Alola can do ok on the Water Surface in this fight, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokemon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokemon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water-type moves. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.


Regardless of which fight you chose, you'll be rewarded with the *Torrent Badge* and *TM55 Scald*. Sweet.

Continue into the next room in the bottom right. Going right at the fork will lead you to an *Elemental Seed*. Follow the path through, surfacing. Continue to follow the path at the next dive spot. At the fork, go left instead of right. The next room contains Amaria #1 swimming around the upper loop. 

Exit this room at the top and surface to get a *Max Revive*. Dive back down, this time exiting the large room in the southeast exit. In a loop to the right, you'll find Amaria #2. Exit this room on the northeast side.

Go left at the first fork to reach the *Slowbronite*! Back at the fork head straight up, and then left as soon as you can to surface. There's a hidden *Ability Capsule* at the base of the waterfall. Grab it, then head back up the waterfall and dive down into the room we were just in. In the northeast is Amaria #3. From here, head into the room we previously visited in the southwest corner.

Continue through this room and follow the path to the next in the bottom left corner. Exit the next room via the left-most exit, and at the fork in the next room, go right. Surface here, then follow the path at the next dive spot. This is the fork where we started our diving, so enter the door at the top and surface, then leave. Prepare yourself, then return to the gym when ready.

Take the teleporter to the gym arena and talk to Titania, then to Amaria. 

Amaria will ask you if you want to battle in Singles or Doubles.

Amaria's Doubles team is built well around the Water Surface and the spread of Surf to your party while taking little/no damage from the spread to her party members, as Vaporeon and Seismitoad both have Water Absorb. This means your own Water-types will potentially have a harder time on this fight than the singles fight. With Primarina'and Blastoise's coverage, Lanturn to check your Electric-types and no-status condition Lapras to potentially ruin a sweeper's day thanks to Perish Song and Protect, she has a pretty bulky team that can deal with lots of teams you attempt to use. On Zekrom Route only, her Blastoise has a Fighting-type Z-move, as well.

As with the singles fight you may consider transforming the field. Murkwater Surface will deal passive damage to her team members each turn... but Lanturn and Blastoise may change it back with Whirlpool. Icy Field helps alleviate the speed issues, boosts, etc... but can be changed back with Seismitoad's Earthquake. The latter is potentially a good route to go with if you have a fast special-attacking Grass type who can one shot Seismitoad on turn 1. You can also try using the Water Surface or Underwater to your advantage - without Swift Swim on any of her Pokemon, bringing some Swift Swimmers of your own might let you outspeed and crush her with the right setups. Raichu-Alola can do ok on the Water Surface in this fight, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokemon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokemon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water-type moves. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.


Regardless of which fight you chose, you'll be rewarded with the *Torrent Badge* and *TM55 Scald*. Sweet.

# Episode 18: Void-Kissed

Exit the gym! Time to progress the story just a little bit in order to knock out some sidequests.

Head over to Calcenon City, then enter "that one apartment building where a bunch of plot happens, for some reason". You know the one.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree with Hardy about charging the base (+1 Hardy, -1 Florinia)
- Disagree with Hardy about charging the base (-1 Hardy, +1 Florinia)

Head out towards Route 4. In the gatehouse, talk to Charlotte if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you believe her while you have >= 0 points with her (+1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you believe her while you have < 0 points with her (-1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you don't believe her while you have >= 0 points with her (-1 Charlotte)
- Tell Charlotte you don't believe her while you have < 0 points with her (+1 Charlotte)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you are going to do something about it (+1 Charlotte)

Head out to Route 4. On the east end of the right, you'll see Hardy standing next to a Rock Climbing wall, and as you might guess, he gives us *TMX9 Rock Climb*. Up the nearby hill would be where we'd go to continue the story, but we do have a few sidequests to take care of in the meantime!

## Reborn Restoration Project 3

With 16 badges in hand, we can finally complete the third and last of the Grand Hall restoration projects. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #3 (+1 Adrienn)

Once you've funded all three projects, the guy at the desk will give you the *Absolite*. 

If you'd like to complete another one, the choices and corresponding references are here:

- [Affordable Living in Obsidia](#affordable-living-in-obsidia-project) ($60000)
- [Railnet Reconstruction](#railnet-reconstruction-project) ($100000)
- [Azurine Nature Center](#azurine-nature-center-project) ($80000)

## Starter Egg Quest Part 2

Since the last time we made progress on this quest, it is now guaranteed that we can complete all three of the restoration projects, meaning by now it is guaranteed that we can breed Bulbasaur, Chimchar, and either Oshawott or Litten depending on gang choice. We also recently found Rowlet, so we can donate four more eggs to Kamaya in the Grand Hall.

This brings the total up to 17/21 eggs donated; since we passed 15, that means we get the *Reset Disc- SPDEF* as a reward. The next time I will bring us back here, we will for sure have the last four starters to finish this quest.

## Rock Climb Exploration

We've chopped down menacing small trees. We've smashed brittle rocks and pushed aside heavy boulders. We've crossed massive bodies of water, gone up perilous waterfalls and dived down to the deepest trenches imaginable. We've lit up the darkest of dungeons and flown across the vast Reborn Region. But now? It's finally time to climb rocks.

You can probably tell we're reaching the endgame, so there are tons of excellent but optional rewards that we can now get with Rock Climb. Follow along to grab 'em all, or jump to the Route 4 section to get on with the story. Note that any rock walls that I don't mention here are merely shortcuts (and, mostly obsolete thanks to Fly).

### Climbin' at Azurine & Apophyll

I'll start with some easy ones. Fly over to Azurine Island. Surf up from the nature center - towards the middle of the big island, you'll see a climbable wall. At the end of the short path above it, you'll be able to pick up the *Poisonium-Z*!

Next, fly over to Apophyll Beach. Make your way towards Pyrous Mountain, and climb down to get *TM52 Focus Blast*. Hope you don't miss!

### Climbin' at Teknite Ridge

First, fly over to the desert. Make your way all the way to the Teknite Cave in the northwest. Progress through the cave until you reach the split paths on 4F. Use the top left exit and make your way all the way to the dead end. 

By hopping across some rocks to the top left corner, you'll notice a climbing wall. At the top, you can find a hidden *Ability Capsule* and a **Jangmo'o** egg! Sweet.

That's not all we can do in the Teknite Ridge, but we will be accessing a different side of the ridge to finish up.

Fly over to the Beryl Ward, and enter the Beryl Cave. On 1F, you can use Rock Climb to access a new area. Grab the hidden *Red Shard* and head into the next room, which has a hidden *Hard Stone*. Climb up once more to emerge into a new section of the Teknite Ridge.

**Teknite Ridge (Beryl Cave Area)**

|Gliscor           |1  |                  |   |                  |   |

Hidden on this map, we can obtain a *Green Shard*, *Energy Powder*, *Dusk Ball*, *Common Candy*, and *Calcium*. Enter the cave at the top.

**Teknite Cave (Beryl Cave Area)**

|Cave              |%  |

|Aggron            |1  |
 
Grab the hidden *Heart Scale*. We'll need to transform this field to Dark Crystal Cavern - using the TM for Dark Pulse, this should be doable. 

Once you succeed, smash the wall at the top and proceed to the next room. Head up once you're ready for a fight.

**Pokemon Fulgor. Field: Dark Crystal Cavern**
- Volcarona, Lv. 100, @Sitrus Berry, Ability: Swarm, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Quiver Dance
    - Signal Beam
    - Giga Drain
    - Heat Wave

A fight against one excellent Pokemon, but I'm sure you can find a way to defeat it by now. Pick up the *Catching Charm: Ruby* here, as well as the hidden *Fire Stone* and *Ability Capsule*. Talk to the sunburst thing in the top right side of the room to battle and catch **Larvesta**! 

Exit the cave. You can fly out from the Ridge.

### Climbin' at Route 2 and Route 3

Fly to the Celestinine Cascade. By heading down the stairs from the Fiore Gym, climb the first rock wall you see to get *TM28 Leech Life*. If you haven't moved the nearby Crustle to access the cave behind it, Rock Climb will make doing this easy.

Make your way to the north side of Route 2. On the right, you'll see a short climb leading to 5 *Exp. Candy XL*. 

Next, climb the ladder to Route 3. Climb down the single tile Rock Climb to skip the first cave, then go as far right as you can. Enter the next cave and climb the rock in the top left corner inside to get a hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. From here, proceed all the way through the cave as we did once before until you emerge back on Route 3.

From here, go right and climb down the rocks nearby. Grab the hidden *Synthetic Seed* and enter the nearby cave. Here, you can get *TM53 Energy Ball*, a *Dragon Fang*, and a hidden *Full Restore*. Exit this cave.

### Climbin' in Tanzan Depths

Fly over to the Tanzan Cove and enter the main part of Tanzan Mountain. Go past the meteor base and down the stairs to enter the Tanzan Depths.

In the area where we fought Steelix, make your way to the top left and climb across the metal beam. Climb up here. You'll find a *Muscle Band*, *Rock Memory*, *Big Nugget*, and *Kangaskhanite* here as well as hidden items: *Escape Rope*, 4 *Tiny Mushrooms*, *Green Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Exp. Candy XL*, *Awakening*, *Blue Shard*, and *Carbos*. 

Enter any one of the three caves.

**Tanzan Depths (Small Back Caves)**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Sandslash         |30 |
|Graveler-Alola    |20 |
|Dugtrio           |15 |
|Durant            |14 |
|Hippowdon         |14 |
|Seviper           |5  |
|Steelix           |1  |
|Excadrill         |1  |

Use Earthquake, Magnitude, etc. in a battle twice to make some green crystal gems fall - this is necessary to explore the other part of the Tanzan Depths.

Use an Escape Rope or Dig to save time if you'd like, and return to Tanzan Cove. Surf across the cove and enter the Tanzan Mountain entrance here. Climb down the rocks.

In the next room, you can find an *Exp. Candy XL* as well as a hidden *Super Repel*, *Escape Rope*, 2 *PokeSnax*, *Purple Shard*, *Stardust*, and *Great Ball*, as well as tons of mining rocks. Once you get everything, break the ground by using Magnitude or Earthquake twice in battle once more.

The floor will collapse, creating a new climbing wall. Head down. In the next room, talk to the Green Crystal to get Larvitar to move. You can get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Awakening* in here. Proceed to the next room.

Here is the first of the Larvitar puzzles. By knocking down the four green crystals, we can use them as directions that we want Larvitar to go. As long as there is a path in the specified direction (up, down, left, right) to a translucent rock, it will go there and remove it. I will provide routes in invisible text that remove the most rocks and allow you to get all items.

> U U U R R D R R R U R L D R R R D D R

Pick up the now-accessible *Jolly Mint* and *Timid Mint*. Proceed to the next room.

> L U R D U R R R U L R D R L U R U L R R R R R R D R R D L D D L D U R D D 

Pick up the now-accessible *Focus Sash*, *Modest Mint*, and *Nugget*. The door in the bottom left side where Larvitar entered will lead you to an *Ability Capsule*. Backtrack and enter the next room in the top right.

> L U U R U U L D U R D R D U U R R R U U R R R D D D L D U L R D D L D R

Pick up the *Amplified Rock*, *Adamant Mint*, and 4 *Glitter Balls*, then proceed.

In this next room, you can get the *Rockium-Z* as well as a hidden *Dark Gem* and 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. And, of course, you can battle and catch **Larvitar**! 

That's all we can do here, so escape from this cave.

### Climbin' in the Iolia Valley

Make your way to the east side of Route 1, then Rock Slide down into the Iolia Valley. Make your way to Luna's gym room. You can actually rock climb in here. 

Do so, then use the purple crystal to grab a *Dark Material*. Exit the cave.

We should now have 3 Dark Materials - one is at the top of the waterfall in this valley, the other was in the locked room of the Sanctum. With all three in your bag as well as a Soul Candle, fly over to Lapis Ward and make your way down to the Subseven Sanctum.

Talk to the summoning table for a battle with **Deino**.

### Climbin' in the Mountains

Next, it's time to enter the three-mountain complex one more time for a few goodies. Fly over to the Route 1 Nature Center, grab a Tauros and make your way to the Celestinine Mountain B2F entrance via the North Aventurine Woods.

At the top of the ice puzzle, you'll see a climbing wall. Go up it, then surf to the left and push the nearby boulder to the left. Rock climb back down, this time making your way down the stairs to the left of the ice puzzle. Head up past the pushed boulder to get a *Life Orb*. Pokemon Showdown, here we come.

From here, our next destination is Ametrine Mountain 2F. You can either go through the mountain complex to get there or just fly to the Circus or Ametrine City and make your way there that way.

We've gone this path once before to get some items. Climb the waterfall to 3F, then cross the ice north. Carefully go across the ice on the top left side to climb another fall to 4F. Once you reach 4F, save the game for in case you mess up, then beach at the top. You'll see a rock chilling in the middle of the ice puzzle towards the top left side. Drop down the ledge such that you'll be stopped by that rock, then go right and up into a climbable wall. Grab a hidden *Blue Shard* then go up to 5F. 

Complete an ice puzzle here, grab a *Paralyze Heal*, then take the waterfall down. Not down one floor, not two, but down EIGHT floors, you'll land on Ametrine Mountain B4F.

**Ametrine Mountain B4F**

|Snorunt           |4  |                  |   |

Yay, another pseudo legendary now obtainable.

On this floor, you can also pick up the *Icium-Z* as well as a *Jolly Mint* and 4 *Exp. Candy XL*. You can also find a hidden *Burn Heal* and *Antidote* down here.

That's all we can do in here, so escape the mountains however you please.

## Upper Route 4

That wraps up all the optional rocks that we can climb, so fly on back to Calcenon and head east to where Hardy is on Route 4. Climb the rocks here.

Note that there are a lot of different encounter tables for the various maps of Route 4.

On the map you can get a hidden *Red Shard*, *Guard Spec*, *Heart Scale*, and *Green Shard*. Climb the rock to the next map.

Grab a hidden *Cotton Candy* here then use the left of the two rock climbs to go up. Grab a hidden *Telluric Seed* and proceed up the next slope. Here, you can get a hidden *Max Repel*, *Red Shard*, and *Escape Rope* on this level. Towards the bottom left side, there is a climbing path that goes down and left. Climb down it.

This brings us back to the first map we were on, at a different point. Grab a hidden *Synthetic Seed* then climb up the rocks on the left. Grab the *Full Restore* and the hidden *Green Shard*.

Make your way back to the previous map and go up the slope towards the top. On this map, a chill will settle in the air.

Pick up the hidden *Super Potion*. As hinted at as we entered, we're going to need to transform the field. Battles are fought on the Mountain Field - to transform it into Snowy Mountain, you'll need to use Blizzard, Subzero Slammer via the Ice-type Z crystal we got previously, or by letting Hail be on the field for 3 turns. Piloswine will be able to use Blizzard, so you can try to encounter one if you don't have these moves.

Once you do, snow will gather on the map.

Grab the *Ice Stone* atop the hill once you're able to. Climb back down the hill, and back down to the first fork. Climb up the hill to a new map with a lake on it.

On this map, you will find a hidden *Red-Hots*, *X Sp. Def*, *Magical Seed*, *Ice Gem*, *Salt-Water Taffy*, *Ice Heal*, and *Hyper Potion*. There are lots of paths we can go from here, and I will start by doing the rock climb path in the top left, accessible via surfing on the water. To reach the water, surf from the hop rock with the little stairs at the bottom.

Once you succeed, climb the mountain. We'll land on a higher part of a map from earlier. Enter the shed here. 

Pick up *TM73 Thunder Wave* here. Press 'A' while you're above the disconnected wires to connect them, prepare your team, then make your way to the top left corner for a fight.

**BreloomBot CL:4R1-C3. Field: Short-Circuit Field**
- CL:4R1-C3 Breloom, Lv. 90, @Muscle Band, Ability: Technician, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 4/252/0/0/0/252
  - Spore
  - Magnet Bomb
  - Shadow Punch
  - Shift Gear

This is a very tough fight with a custom, overpowered Breloom robot! Thankfully it's still a 6v1 so you should be able to figure out a way to take it out. It does have mixed attacks, the ability to put you to sleep, and a set up move, so be careful as it alone can counter many strategies. 

Once you win, a **Gastly** will pop out of the robot. It will run around the robot to hide from you, but you can battle it by talking to it if you're quick enough. I recommend disabling speed up for this part. 

Return to the area with the lake. This time, take the rock climbing path in the top right corner. Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* here.

As you're hinted to do, we'll need to transform the Snowy Mountain Field here into a Mountain. Many of the burning Fire-type moves like Lava Plume and Fire Pledge will do the trick. You can also use a Fire-type Z-move. Once the field is changed, you'll be sent to a new map. Use the hopping stones to enter the cave.

As in the previous map, it is hinted that we're gonna want to change the field, this time from Icy Field to Cave Field. Doing this will open the above water encounters as well as letting you grab the *Heracronite* and hidden *Focus Sash* in the pond.

Of course, this room also has a secret. From the pond, go clockwise around the ring. You'll be able to sneak behind a rock here. A counter-clockwise loop will lead to 3 hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. Follow the loop clockwise, until you see the shortcuts in the bottom walls to climb up further. Use these to reach the cave exit, but don't go out quite yet. From here, follow the outermost loop clockwise all the way around to get a hidden *Big Nugget*. Backtrack this loop, then exit the cave at the top.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* and *Nugget*. Talk to Bagon here and show it how to Fly... and it will do so, off the cliff. Backtrack through Charous Mountain all the way back to the map with the lake.

This time, make your way all the way to the bottom right corner of the map. Climb down here. Once more, burn the Snow on the Mountain away to uncover the *Lycanium-Z*.

Climb back to the previous map, this time going down the rocks to the left. You can find a hidden *Swift Wing*, *Big Pearl*, and *Chesto Berry*.

Use the rock wall in the bottom right corner to reach a new map. Grab the hidden *Escape Rope* here. Transform the field to Snowy Mountain and a new rock climb path will be created, so follow it up.

Pick up the *Ultra Potion* and hidden *Liechi Berry*, then melt the Snowy Mountain as we've done before. In exchange for a Revive, you'll be able to obtain our friend from earlier and the final pseudo-legendary: **Bagon**. 

Head back two maps. This time, use the rock climb in the bottom-left corner to go down to another map with a large lake.

You can find a hidden *Elemental Seed*, *Ultra Ball*, *Moon Stone*, and *Rawst Berry* here. Surfing across the water to the little island, you can get a *Max Elixir* and a hidden *Heart Scale*.

Climb the rocks in the upper left corner to reach a new section of the first Upper Route 4 map we landed on, containing the *Mimikium-Z*. Let's snuggle forever. Return to the previous map.

That's it for Route 4 exploration and goodies, so talk to Hardy in the big open area on the left side of the area.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Take on Hardy's bet (+1 Hardy)

Enter the building, and look around with Hardy. Once he leaves, follow him outside and talk to him again. Move the metal plate. If you took on the bet you'll get $2000. 

Up and to the right, you'll see a now-accessible ladder, and Absol. Don't we love it when Absol shows up? Head down the ladder...

## Glass Workstation

Talk to Hardy, then follow him into the elevator. Talk to Bennett.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say "To be stronger than anyone" (-1 Bennett)
- Say "To win Luna" (Neutral)
- Say "To make things different" (+2 Bennett)
- Say that you don't remember (+1 Bennett)

Once you wake up, climb up the ladder, and go left into the opening. Follow Glaceon down the path. You'll see one of its abilities: to bridge short gaps on the upper floor with its ice. Jump down to the bottom floor. There's a door towards the bottom here which contains a healing machine and PC.

This building is basically a big puzzle. Feel free to skip ahead if you'd rather solve it yourself.

Talk to Glaceon again to see another of its abilities: creating a path over lava. Confront the Meteor Grunt at the top, and he will run away. Thankfully there is another way in: down and to the left, you'll see a glass window! By now hopefully we should know what to do when we see glass.

Defeat the Team Meteor Grunt, and talk to the monitor in the corner to open the door. Glaceon will start to follow you. You can talk to it to heal status conditions on your team members for free. You can also choose whether to pet Glaceon or not, for the quest but also for points and a different battle later on. Pretty intense choice, I know.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Glaceon (+2 Lumi)
- Don't pet Glaceon (-3 Lumi)

Exit this room and make your way left. Use Glaceon's ability on the lava in both places, then make your way to the left. Glaceon can also create paths across sand, so do so here. Make your way to the top left side of the room and attempt to enter the small room towards the top. Defeat the grunt.

He'll lock you out, so make your way back towards the right. A path will be cleared for you, so break the nearby glass and defeat another grunt inside. Talk to the monitor in the corner to open the door, then talk to Espeon's cage. We can't get it out of here quite yet, however. 

Exit this room at the bottom. You'll notice another glass window to the right, which you can again smash your way into. Defeat the grunt and pick up the *Timid Mint*, 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, and *PP All*. Exit this room.

There's nowhere else to go but up the ladder to the right. Unfortunately Glaceon can't follow you up the ladder, so keep that in mind. Anyways, follow this linear path into another room, defeat the grunt, and grab the *Cage Key*. Head all the way back, join back up with Glaceon, and free Espeon!

Espeon can use Future Sight, which shows a blurry image of our next objectives. Helpful if you get stuck... or you can just read on. Anyways, you can also choose to pet Espeon for the quest, and for points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Pet Espeon (+1 Eve)
- Don't pet Espeon (-1 Eve)

You'll notice that Espeon and Glaceon won't both be able to follow you at the same time, so you'll need to position the one you don't wanna take with you in the right place. You'll see what I mean now: switch to Glaceon outside, then head to the left of the nearby pallet of glass. Talk to Glaceon, and tell it to stay where it is. Head back to get Espeon, who can use telekinesis to move glass. Back on the side where Glaceon is, move this glass pallet up by interacting with it, then pressing up. 

From here, go right across the sand, then up at the first lava bridge. Move the glass at the top to the left, then smash your way into the nearby room via the window. Defeat the two scientists here, then talk to the monitor at the top to unlock the elevator.

Back outside, move the right glass pallet down to save a bit of time later on. Make your way to the bottom right corner of this room and move the glass up to get the *Sablenite*. Move this pallet back down by going around.

Heading left, you'll see three pallets of glass close to each other. Before we move these, you're going to want to actually swap Espeon for Glaceon. Drop off Glaceon on the right side of these three pallets. Go pickup Espeon once more, and move the pallets respectively up, left, and down to open a path. 

From here, swap back to Glaceon, then drop it off near the ladder in the bottom right. Head back up to grab Espeon, then make your way back to the ladder where Glaceon is. Move the nearby glass up, then enter the door along this path. Past a grunt is 2 *EV Boosters*.

Anyways, head outside and go left. Move the bottom-most of the three glass pallets back up so we can pass along the bottom. Switch to Glaceon and make a path over the ice in the bottom left. Switch back to Espeon.

Enter the bottom left room where we found the key. Move each of the five glass pallets left to reach *TM29 Psychic*! Exit this room. Cross the lava and move the nearby glass up. Go right from here, and move a glass pallet to the right to get the *Gyaradosite*! 

Make your way to Glaceon, and reverse the steps we took to get both Pokemon to the bottom so that both Pokemon are now back towards the top. After clearing a path to the elevator in the top left corner, switch to Glaceon and head up to B1F.

From here, follow the path to the left, bridging gaps with ice. Enter the next room. Defeat the grunt to pick up 3 *Exp. Candy XL* and an *EV Tuner*. Back at the elevator, go straight to the right and use Glaceon to bridge a gap towards *PULSE Readout 8*. Up and left from here, you'll find a room containing glass, so we'll come back later. Continue bridging gaps and enter the room on the right.

It's been a while since we've seen Aster on this route. This time he encorporates a few of Eclipse's Pokemon into his own team. As usual, he focuses on Rock and Ground types, with Passimian there to provide hard hitting coverage. His team is generally pretty fast and physical, so speed control and/or some physical tanks will probably be able to find success. If you can tank an Explosion from Solrock and set up, he has no priority moves to prevent a sweep.

He'll give you the *Meteor Card*.

### Finishing Up in the Workstation

If you didn't get it from Aster, grab the *Meteor Card* at the top. You can also get 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Open the pods in this room. 

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Use Heal Bell on Noel (+1 Noel)

Take the elevator back to the bottom floor. Before we continue, take Glaceon into the elevator where Hardy is sleeping.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Use Heal Bell on Hardy twice (+1 Hardy)

Next, switch back to Espeon. Return to the room on the upper floor with the glass. Move the glass out of the way. Note that despite every pallet in the dungeon so far appearing to only move "along the grain", you'll need to push the bottom right one down to finish this puzzle. It's a bit odd but mess around with this puzzle a few times and you'll figure it out. Anyways, you'll get a *Reborn Ball*! This is Reborn's Master Ball.

Return to B2F, and switch to Glaceon. Move Glaceon up and to the left of the rightmost sand pit, then switch back to Espeon. From here, take Espeon to the top right, pushing the first and second glass pallets to the right. Head back and switch to Glaceon, then use it to make a path across lava in the top left. Grab the 5 *Exp. Candy XL*. 

Position Glaceon exactly in this spot: 

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/glass_glaceon.jpg"/>

Next, pick up Espeon and stand directly under Glaceon. Move the two glass pallets out of the way so you can switch to Glaceon and make a bridge across the lava to the north. Switch back to Espeon and head up, moving two more pallets out of the way and revealing the Meteor Card scanner. Use it to open the door.

Undo the moves we did to reach the top right corner. Head to the top left corner and use Espeon to finally clear a path to the door. This is it for exploration. Prepare your team as best you can for the shenanigans to come, and enter the door at the top!

### The Glass Gauntlet

Now begins one of the most glorious parts of Reborn. I'll let each of the fights speak for itself.

This battle is our first 12v6! On average each of our Pokemon has to be knocking out 2 each in order to win this thing. While that is a fairly large disadvantage, there are lots of tactics we can use to come out on top in this fight: The best advice I can give for Reborns 12v6 doubles fights (of course, there will be more) is that conserving momentum is extremely important. In this case, Cain and Shelly each have Pokemon all 7+ levels *under* the cap, and neither team is particularly suited to abuse this field effect in particular, so it's a good fight to ease into the 12v6 setup.

Of course, Shelly's entire team is weak to Rock Slide, so it's not a bad idea to operate from the doubles priniciple: "support your Rock Slider at all costs". Heat Wave is also pretty potent here for similar reasons - a sun team can devastate here. You can fairly easily opt for a speed control strategy of some sort - Magic Bouncing back the Sticky Web or embracing it and abusing 8 turn Trick Room are excellent choices. You can also use Factory Field to your advantage blah blah... you knew that by now. Optimize your team to the max cap, come with a strategy to conserve momentum, and you'll be able to find a way to come out on top.

Ok, so after finally overcoming a fight with all the odds stacked against you... surprise, a singles fight against a mystery trainer. You can't switch out your team at all but thankfully you do get a heal before this one.

Here's the thing. This fight, generally speaking, isn't gonna be the worst thing in the world. It's a 6v6 and your opponent has a mostly frail team plus Umbreon and sort of Gothitelle. If that's all there was to say, I'd assume you'd be able to find a way through this one and that would be that. The problem is: *any Pokemon that are fainted at the end of this fight stay fainted for the next*, basically as if you use Full Restores on all living Pokemon and nothing more. And for the next fight, you'll really want as many Pokemon as you can take. 

So, with the goal of simply making sure that every one of your Pokemon stays alive? Weavile has a Focus Sash, meaning your lead for the whole gauntlet needs to be able to deal two hits of damage without dying (or switch). Mismagius is fast and if you make the mistake of letting it set up a Nasty Plot, there's a good chance it will claim a soul or two. Honchkrow is really nasty, with Sucker Punch allowing it to punish weakened Pokemon. Umbreon is annoyingly bulky, with Foul Play to hurt your physical attackers even more. Mega Absol is of course really strong and you're usually going to find yourself in a kill or be killed scenario with it. Finally there is Gothitelle... who has Shadow Tag and Calm Mind. Meaning if there's any Pokemon on your team the AI has realized it can beat by switching in Gothitelle at any time... that Pokemon is as good as dead!

So now you see the challenge this seemingly simple 6v6 fight offers. If you think you can beat the next fight with 4-5 Pokemon alive, feel free to try if you are having a hard time with this one. There are some general tips I recommend to make it through this one with minimal casualties, however. For Weavile, Fake Out, multi-hit moves, and Sandstorm are all viable ways to break the sash, so setting up your gauntlet team with one of these first in your party will probably help. Honchkrow likes to come in on a weakened Pokemon, so try to anticipate Sucker Punch and either switch or set up further if you can. Keep in mind if you're faster than Honchkrow, other priority moves like Quick Attack will go before Sucker Punch. Make sure you're always ready for a Gothitelle switch in, or maybe learn exactly when the AI will try to switch it in so you can pivot to something that can knock it out. Speed control, either by superior stats, Tailwind, Trick Room, etc., will then be key to one-shotting Mismagius and Absol before they can get you. If you are able to 2HKO Umbreon, it won't be able to heal itself, so making sure you have either a physical attacker that can live some Foul Plays or a really strong special attacker are key. Even though you already have to plan for other fights with your team... keeping these tips in mind will help you overcome this obstacle, hopefully.

Even after making it through the previous two battles, you're thrusted into a third, and surprise, its another 12v6. While opponent levels are indeed a bit lower, without being able to change your team after the previous two fights and the aforementioned faint follow-through, you might even be stuck doing this fight as a 12v4 or 12v5. The good news here is that almost everything in this fight is a frail Ice or Psychic type. The real exceptions here are Bronzong and Metagross, both of which are extremely bulky and can hit really hard on this field, Clefable, who likes to spread Paralysis as a lead, and Bisharp, who can keep up the pressure with Sucker Punch and has enough bulk to live a good chunk of even super effective moves. Ninetales' hail and Aurora Veil are, as always, very beneficial to their team, as is the 8-turn Psychic Terrain Alakazam will try to get off. Really seems like there are lots of threats and not enough Pokemon to cover them all.

Otherwise there's not really a ton I can say: spam 'D' to drop a save before this fight and just play it out as many times as it takes for you to realize where the threats to your team are, and how you can overcome them. Conserving momentum is key as before, Trick Room as always is very potent, and weather and/or the field can help you steamroll. Using Snatch or Brick Break to mess with Aurora Veil, changing the weather, etc. are good options. Even if you have dropped a save mid-gauntlet, don't be afraid to throw away some money (or load a backup save) to better prepare for the gauntlet.

Once you win this battle, you'll find yourself in an area simply called "???".

## Inside The Void

This area is fairly straightforward, as whatever branching paths there are don't really lead anywhere. It's a very story-centric area, so if you are digging the story, talk to every NPC you can and pay attention to your surroundings as you make your way through the void.

When you reach a table full of starters, talk to the position corresponding to the starter you picked when starting the game.

Later on, you'll pass Aya's segment. You can optionally talk to Cain for a third time.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Cain in The Void after Aya's section (+1 Cain)

After seeing Luna and Taka on the left side, a voice will talk to you. Prepare your team before going up, as there's a fight coming up!

**PULSE Hypno. Field: Starlight Arena**
- PULSE Hypno, Lv. 100, @Big Root, Ability: No Guard, Calm Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 0/0/252/4/252/0
    - Hypnosis
    - Dream Eater
    - Dark Pulse
    - Calm Mind

The only way it's healing itself is with Dream Eater, so a Dark-type can slowly whittle it down. With a 4X weakness to bug and a weakness to field-boosted Fairy moves, there's a good chance you'll have something to deal with it. You can also stall with Toxic! Chesto Berries, Safeguard, Sleep Talk, etc. can all help you deal with its 100% accurate Hypnosis as well. Honestly if you can make it through the gauntlet with your team I'm sure you can find a way to beat one PULSE.

Keep following the path, and you'll eventually exit the Void. After another massive conversation, accept the fast travel request to get the heck out of the Glass Workstation.

## The Raid on Agate City

Back in Calcenon City, talk to Shelly towards the right side of the map. Enter the "story building" in Calcenon for some points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly while she is talking to Titania/Serra (+1 Shelly)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reshiram Route only: Talk to Titania while she is talking to Shelly (+1 Titania)
- Zekrom Route only: Talk to Serra while she is talking to Shelly (+1 Serra)

Talk to Eve near the Pokemon Center.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Eve and learn about all the PULSEs remaining (+1 Eve)

Enter the "story building" once more. The squad will leave for Agate City, so fly over to Vanhanen Labyrinth and enter Agate City from the south once more.

A note:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Reshiram Route only: Talk to Titania while doing the Agate raid (-1 Titania)

Defeat the grunts as you progress upwards. Past the Light Shard is a mini-gauntlet.

This fight is a 12v10, with Hardy on your side. Shouldn't be too crazy with his help, just know that whatever team you prepare for the following battle is what you'll be stuck with for this one.

**Meteor Leader Solaris (Full Restore). Field: No Field**
- Staraptor, Lv. 89, @Leftovers, Ability: Intimidate, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 156/100/0/0/0/252

    - Swords Dance
    - Earthquake
    - Dragon Claw
    - Stone Edge

After all this time, we finally get to fight Meteor's Leader Solaris, one-on-one. No field effects are in play this fight: it's just the raw power of basically a Gen 7 OU team versus yours. Staraptor with Intimidate that hits hard? Yep. Technician Scizor with ridiculously strong Bullet Punch? Yep. Dragon Dance Gyarados? Yep. Tyranitar and Excadrill sand core? Of course. And on top of all that is his Mega Garchomp. That is not a typo above: it really does have max EVs in every stat, thanks to its PULSE 2. Get used to these for the end game. Essentially what this means is Garchomp will hit hard but also be bulky enough to live a couple of attacks.

At this point you also have a lot of mega Pokemon and Z-moves to your name. In particular, I find that the Icium-Z can often ensure a kill on Garchomp if you need. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a single special attack on his team... so you can focus your team entirely on physical defense. Some fast (or slow under Trick Room) special attackers running Fire, Ice, and Electric moves will be able to get 5 out of 6 of his party members super-effectively... leaving Tyranitar an excellent candidate for a Close Combat or something. I believe in your ability to defeat this guy!

Make your way to the right. You'll reach a dead end, so surf up to the left of a tree to continue on.

In the next room, Lin will flex on us. Grab the hidden *Super Potion* and *Lucky Egg*, then backtrack to the main part of the city. To the east of the Pokemon Center, watch the scenes play out then talk to Shelly. Hardy will then extend an offer to challenge his gym!

## Agate City & Sidequests

We could accept Hardy's gym battle offer right away, but there are some sidequests with excellent rewards now open: to cut to the chase, we can actually get every single non-legendary Pokemon before fighting Hardy - and if we do get them all, there's a really awesome reward waiting for us. So, let's get into it.

## Custom Pokemon Form Lookup

Pokemon Reborn uses Gen 7 Pokemon, forms, and mechanics. Details for all canon forms can be found on [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) or your favorite Pokemon Database. However, these resources will not have any information on Reborn's custom forms.

While Pokemon Reborn doesn't have any entirely new Pokemon, it does include new forms for many Pokemon. Aside from the Aevian forms, all of these are not available to the player and are instead boss Pokemon. I include full details for these below. Note that these forms can be considered spoilers!

Any attributes that are not listed are unchanged from the base form.
