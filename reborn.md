# Section 1

Welcome to my 100% walkthrough. I love this game, I hope you will too, and I hope this walkthrough can help you if you get stuck or if you want to collect everything that you can in the game.

## All Aboard!

The game will first ask you to choose a player character and gender. It will then ask you if you want to view controls. You can actually rebind controls with F1 and even add controller support! Once you've gotten acquainted with your chosen controls, you'll find yourself on the train.

Ame will ask you if you have any special instructions or passwords. From the game's readme:

<div id="quote">
    <p> At the start of the game, you will be prompted for special instructions, or passwords. Below is a list of applicable passwords. Please note that these are features are considered a bonus, and may have some  unexpected interactions at times... 
    </p><br><br>
    <p>Implement a hard EXP cap when maxed on badges, similar to Pokemon Rejuvenation: </p><br>
        <ul><li>Password: hardcap</li></ul><br>
    <p>Cause randomized early game Pokemon events to bias towards a specific type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Password: mononormal</li>
            <li>Password: monofire</li>
            <li>Password: monowater</li>
            <li>Password: monograss</li>
            <li>Password: monoelectric</li>

            <li>Password: monoground</li>
            <li>Password: monoflying</li>
            <li>Password: monobug</li>
            <li>Password: monopsychic</li>
            <li>Password: monorock</li>
            <li>Password: monoghost</li>
            <li>Password: monodragon</li>
            <li>Password: monodark</li>
            <li>Password: monosteel</li>
            <li>Password: monofairy</li>
        </ul><br>
    <p>Prevent Pokemon from being healed after their HP drops to 0:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nuzlocke</li></ul><br>
    <p>Randomly reshuffles species and moves as rolled at game start:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: randomizer</li></ul><br>
    <p>Pokemon do not need to know HM (TMX) moves in order to use them in the field:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: easyhms</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Prohibits the player's use of items in trainer battles:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: noitems</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 252 EVs and 31 IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: fullevs</li></ul><br>
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 0 EVs and IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: litemode</li></ul><br>    
    <p>Makes all Field	Notes visible immediately</p>
        <ul><li>Password: allfieldapp</li></ul><br>
    <p>Remove some randomness by making all attacks do consistent damage rather than a roll:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nodamageroll</li></ul><br>
    <p>Multiple passwords, including differing monotypes, may be used in tandem with 
    each other, but progress at your own risk~</p><br><br>
    <p>Other hidden passwords may be able to be found in the game.</p>
</div>

If this is your first time playing, don't worry too much about passwords - in fact you can activate passwords later on into the game if you'd like. 

If you want some of my opinions on these passwords:

- If you want to do a challenge run, try one of the *mono\[type\]* passwords. It doesn't enforce any explicit rules for battle, it simply guarantees you suitable Pokemon for random events. I love to do monotype runs (for example, [here's one I have already completed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonReborn/comments/uh5wnk/i_cleared_the_entirety_of_e19_with_only_water/) ) so I really recommend trying one of these especially for a second playthrough.
- I don't prefer these personally, but you can do *nuzlocke* or *randomizer* if you'd like, just note that Nuzlocke doesn't enforce a first-mon-per-area rule explicitly. You can even do both at the same time.
- *hardcap* lets you avoid disobeying via overlevelling, and *easyhms* allows you to use HM's without teaching them to your Pokemon.  I think it is worthwhile to play the game without these two to get the "classic" reborn experience at least once, but if you know you'd prefer the quality of life that comes with these passwords feel free to use them.
- *noitems* makes it so you can't use in battle items like Potion and X-Attack. I prefer this for the extra difficulty it provides and how it increases the value of moves like Recover.
- *nodamagerolls* makes it so moves will always roll the same damage. There are some fights in this game you practically must reset for a couple times at least, so minimizing the randomness is in my opinion pretty handy.
- *fullevs* ramps up the difficulty significantly by making every Pokemon both hit hard and have some bulk. I only recommend this for players with experience.
- *allfieldapp* lets you see data about fields from the start. If you're following this guide I'll be picking up all the notes naturally anyways, so unless you really want to know right away how each field works you'll be ok skipping this one.
- *litemode* is a good choice if you are struggling or want to experience the wonderful characters, world, and puzzles without as much emphasis on battling prowess.

Regardless, *this guide will be from the perspective of a player who is using no passwords.* 

After you're done inputting passwords, enjoy the rest of your train ride!

## Grand Hall

As soon as you're off the train, you'll have a conversation with Ame and Julia. I won't be explaining story events much at all in this walkthrough. This conversation does quietly show off a mechanic in Pokemon Reborn: relationship points! Certain dialogue triggers and events will make certain characters like you more or less. What do they do? [Ame's Devblog post](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/development/records/about-relationship-points-r83/) explains it pretty well, so you can read that to decide if you want to care about them or not.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Julia)
- No (Neutral)

Immediately down from your starting position, in a rock you'll find a hidden *Normal Gem*. There are tons of hidden items in this game, and we won't get the Itemfinder for another two badges or so. I will try my best to explain the positions of all the hidden items that I can until then.

Heading to the right, you'll see a black and green streetsign. Two tiles to the right is a pile of trash containing a hidden *Poke Ball*. To the right you'll find a manhole cover - on the left side is a hidden *Red Shard*. Shards will actually be pretty useful in Reborn for obtaining Ability Capsules and Pokemon as well as learning moves via move tutors.

Proceed to the right into Opal Ward. A girl at the bottom of the area will give you a *Potion*. In general, talk to as many people in Reborn as you can - they offer helpful tips for battles, give you useful items, etc.

If the weather is sunny you will see an Ice Cream Cart here.

Opal Ward Ice Cream Shop

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$600       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$800       |
|*Blue Moon Ice Cream*\*|$20000     |

Every day the Ice Cream Shop appears, there is a 1 in 21 chance that they will be selling the rare Blue Moon Ice Cream. If you talk to them and they are not, then they will not carry Blue Moon Ice Cream until the next sunny day. However, if you save before speaking to them, you can reset the game until they are carrying Blue Moon Ice Cream. It is too expensive for us right now by far, but should you ever want to buy it keep this trick in mind.

Talk to the girl in front of the big building here, and you'll head in. Welcome to the Grand Hall.

Upstairs, you'll be asked which starter Pokemon you'd like to get. You actually get to choose between 21 starters, or you can let fate decide by using the computer at the top of the room. One amazing thing about Reborn is that you can obtain every single Pokemon in the first seven generations within a single savefile of Reborn without trading, and that includes the starters. So, regardless of which you pick, you'll be able to get the other 20 eventually. Your choices are:
- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**

One amazing feature that Pokemon Reborn has is that it doesn't arbitrarily lock each Pokemon's 'hidden' ability behind weird methods. Every Pokemon has an equal chance of having its Hidden Ability as its normal abilities regardless of how you obtain them. That means you can get Intimidate Litten, Sheer Force Totodile, Contrary Snivy and more right now. It is ultimately up to you what you choose of course. Many players recommend Torchic due to its Speed Boost ability, but each starter can be useful in its own way.

If you save in front of the starters (quicksave is, by default, 'D'), you can reset (resetting is, by default, F12. You will become very familiar with this button.) until you get one with satisfactory nature, ability, IV's, and even shininess. The shiny rate in this game is roughly 1 in 91 in this game, so you might just end up with a shiny starter on your first try!

Talk to Ame as soon as you're done, and you'll be taken downstairs and fight your first battle!

Pretty Boy Cain. Field: No Field
- Nidoran M. (Nidoran-M), Lv. 5, Ability: Hustle, Bashful Nature, IVs: 3
    - Tackle
    - Leer
  
Use your starter's stat lowering move once if you'd like then spam your attacking move and hopefully you can win. Note that winning this one is not required, but if you win, you'll get Relationship Points (+1 Cain).

Once you are done with that battle, you'll be healed, then thrust into another without changing things up. While this isn't too bad right now, this will happen more in this game. One thing I should note is that if you spam the quicksave key specifically while a character is moving, you can save between battles. 

Apprentice Victoria. Field: 
- Litten, Lv. 5, Ability: Blaze, Bashful Nature, IVs: 10
    - Scratch
    - Growl

You'll be Lv. 6 now if you won the last one. Use a similar strategy and hopefully you'll come out on top. Note that again winning this one is not required, but if you win, you'll get Relationship Points (+1 Victoria).

After the battle, Ame will give you the *Pokedex*, the *Pokegear,* and of course the *Running Shoes*! Plus, Victoria will give you 5 *Pokeballs*.

Now, we can explore the Grand Hall. This is the region's hub building - we will be checking back here often. 

Talk to the guy in the top left - he will tell us about the password *litemode*. We already knew about this one from the readme, but you can enter it in the future if you'd like.

A guy behind the desk will allow us to bring in grinding trainers to the grand hall. Right now they're a bit too tough for us, but we can come back a bit before the gym leader to grind later.

Talk to a guy next to some display cases if you'd like to buy some candy.

Grand Hall Common Candy Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy* | $75       |

As you might guess, Common Candies are the opposite of rare candies - they'll decrease your Pokemon's level. If you're not doing hardcap, they can help us keep your Pokemon under the level cap, thus obeying your commands. We shouldn't need any right now though. To his right is another shop:

Grand Hall Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Pokeball*     |$200       |

In this guide I will be catching every single Pokemon as soon as it becomes available, so if you're going to do the same you're gonna need a lot of Pokeballs. As in the mainline games, you get a *Premier Ball* with every 10 Pokeballs you purchase. In a pinch we can almost always safely return to a Pokemon Center, so buying Potions and Antidotes may be just to save time for now.

On your way out the door, you'll see two people right by the exit. One of them will offer you a Pokemon for $500. But when you do, someone will steal it! If you want to skip this event for now until you have more money you can - we won't actually get to have this Pokemon for... 14 more badges.

That's all we can really do in the Grand Hall for now, so head outside.

## Opal Ward

Note that for now I will not be listing the teams of all of the rando trainers scattered around the region - that would be a lot of content that might not be so useful. If you would like to see the regular trainers, let me know.

Anyways, there is grass here, which means we can obtain new team members! I will be **bolding** any Pokemon that are new.

Opal Ward

|Land (Morning/Day)|%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Rattata**       |30 |**Rattata**       |30 |
|**Bidoof**        |30 |**Meowth**        |20 |
|**Patrat**        |15 |**Ekans**         |20 |
|**Pidgey**        |15 |**Hoothoot**      |17 |
|**Meowth**        |5  |**Spinarak**      |13 |
|**Ekans**         |5  |                  |   |

Specifically I recommend training up Bidoof as soon as possible - it gets Headbutt at Level 13, which allows you to catch Pokemon in trees. We will also be able to trade away Bibarel for a different Pokemon pretty soon, so that's something to keep in mind.

On the left side of the area, in the left broken statue you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*.

Talk to the trainer here with the Snubbull or Stufful, and they will leave. Back at the bottom of the area, you'll now be able to fight trainers to get onto Opal Bridge. I will be going from the left side, clockwise around the bridge. 

Head up and to the left, beating the trainers as you go. A rock in the top left corner contains a hidden *Awakening*. To the right, you'll fight a Gentleman. All the way down from him and one tile to the left contains a hidden *Blue Shard*.

To the right, you'll find three bullies. You'll need two Pokemon to be able to fight the last two, so catch a second if you haven't yet. When you win, you'll get **Pachirisu** or **Zigzagoon**, randomly determined. Note that whenever there is a random event like this, you will be able to get the other one(s) later in the game. The *monoelectric* password would guarantee Pachirisu, for example, while *mononormal* would guarantee Zigzagoon. If you got Zigzagoon, you can train that up instead of Bidoof if you'd like for Headbutt which it learns at level 11.

The first rock you see down from here contains a hidden *Antidote*. After defeating the trainers that's pretty much all we can do here, so head back towards the train station.

# Lower Peridot Ward

In the Lower Peridot Ward, things have opened up! Head up as soon as you can. A rock on the left side will contain a hidden *Escape Rope*. Talk to the guy here, and give him $150 total. We can't do anything in the house behind him quite yet, so head up from here. 

You'll find a gym here. We can't go in yet, but if you go up and around to the right, you'll find a *Gift Box*. 

Also, specifically when the weather is thunderstorming, you'll find **Blitzle** here. Since it's Lv. 15 it might be a bit too tough to deal with right now, so you can come back later. Note that this is the first encounter that is only possible with the right weather - if you'd like to avoid having to wait you can use the *weathermod* password at your next opportunity.

To the left, you'll find a couple of black and green street signs. All the way down and one tile to the right of the top-left sign, you'll find a hidden *Paralyze Heal*. 

To the left, you'll find another Pokemon Center. The rock just outside to the left contains a hidden *Elemental Seed*. Hang on to this for now - it will be useful later on. In a house to the left, you can take a quiz to find out what kind of Pokemon you'd be, just for fun. Enneagram? Myers-Briggs? Nah. *This* is the real personality quiz.

Anyways, down and to the right from here you'll find some more trainers and also a Teddiursa! It will run off and we'll have to chase it. I will cover all the locations later on, but keep in mind finding it three times will allow you to battle and catch it.

Immediately above Teddiursa you'll find a pile of trash paper on the left side, between two girders. One tile up and one tile right from that contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

There's nothing else here for now, so head down and left from this area and enter the first house that you can. Inside, you'll find a *Pokesnax*! This item is crucial for getting certain Pokemon. Back outside, go one tile left and all the way down. In the final tile you can stand on is a hidden *Exp. Candy XS*. 

Head back up and to the right, and you'll find another trainer. The building directly above him has a pile of trash paper to its right, which contains a hidden *Blue Shard*. Up from here, in a box you can find a hidden *Common Candy*. Since we are holding the snax, talk to the dumpster next to it to catch **Gulpin**. Inside the house, also thanks to the snax, you'll be able to catch **Whismur**. 

Return to the guy we gave money to - behind him in a house you will find **Minccino** or **Espurr**, randomly determined. With the snax in your bag, it will join you! 

Head to the left of the Pokemon center, and go down. In a house, a guy will give you the *Old Rod*! 

Back outside, we can actually fish in the dirty water.

Lower Peridot Ward

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Grimer**        |100|

You can talk to the group below if you'd like, but you can't do anything here quite yet. To the right, you'll find a building to the left and up of the snax house. Inside, you'll be able to battle a guy. If you win, he'll let you into his pool, where you can find a *Sea Incense*.

Lower Peridot Ward Pool

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Goldeen**       |70 |
|**Finneon**       |30 |

Head out, and back up past the Old Rod house. You'll find the Name Rater's house here. Up from here, the first barrel you see will hide a *Heart Scale*. Straight to the left and down between the two brown buildings you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*. 

Enter the building here and talk to the old man for a battle. If you win, you'll be able to enter his garden. 

Seacrest's Garden

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Ledyba**        |30 |**Caterpie**      |30 |Hoothoot          |30 |
|**Cherubi**       |24 |**Wurmple**       |30 |Spinarak          |24 |
|**Wurmple**       |20 |**Sunkern**       |30 |**Wurmple**       |20 |
|**Caterpie**      |20 |**Cherubi**       |10 |**Caterpie**      |20 |
|**Sunkern**       |6  |                  |   |**Sunkern**       |6  |

Back outside, head to the right. Enter the first building here. You'll find out about an injured Skitty - when we get an Oran Berry we will be back. Head outside and go right.

You'll fight a trainer in a small park. Once you beat her, talk to her again for a *Rose Incense*. Down and to the left from here you'll find a *Paralyze Heal* hidden in a box.

Back up from here, enter the building. Talk to the guy here and give him the Gift Box we found earlier, and you'll obtain a **Delibird**! The building to the right of this one contains an ailing **Kricketot** which you can obtain by talking to the person here. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Accept Kricketot (+1 Shelly)
- Reject Kricketot (-1 Shelly)

Kricketune with its Fury Cutter attack and Technician ability can be incredible in the early game, so consider using it.

Back outside, talk to the yellow haired guy for a battle. When you beat him you can access the Lower Peridot Alley.

Lower Peridot Alley

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Trubbish**      |60 |
|**Stunky**        |22 |
|**Poochyena**     |18 |

Poochyena evolves early and can have the Moxie ability, so it can be fantastic in the early game.

To the right of the blue bin is a hidden *Dark Gem*. After defeating the trainer on the left you'll get a *Super Potion*. During thunderstorms specifically, you'll be able to get **Tynamo**!

Head outside and go to the right under the bridge. When the weather is rainy, you'll find **Pansear** or **Panpour**, randomly determined. The second from the right box on the bottom row contains a *Purple Shard*. Head to the right.

Underground Railnet

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Noibat**        |74 |
|**Woobat**        |20 |
|Stunky            |6  |

Woobat can be pretty solid if you evolve it early thanks to its Simple ability.

Plus, a rock at the top left contains a hidden *Guard Spec.* Once you're done here, head back to the left and go up past Seacrest's Garden to enter the northern part of Peridot Ward.

## Full Password List

I don't recommend reading this list until you've played through the game once - the passwords in the readme are usually sufficient for first-time playthroughs, and this list is pretty comprehensive and spoils some gameplay elements. Regardless, I have listed every password and its effect below:
