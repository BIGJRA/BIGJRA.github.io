# Section 1

Welcome to my walkthrough.

## All Aboard!

The game will first ask you to choose a player character and gender. It
will then ask you if you want to view controls. You can actually rebind 
controls with F1 and even add controller support! Once you've gotten 
acquainted with your chosen controls, you'll find yourself on the train.

Ame will ask you if you have any special instructions or passwords. From the
game's readme:

<div id="quote">
<p> At the start of the game, you will be prompted for special instructions, or
passwords. Below is a list of applicable passwords. 
Please note that these are features are considered a bonus, and may have some 
unexpected interactions at times... </p><br>

<p>Implement a hard EXP cap when maxed on badges, similar to Pokémon Rejuvenation: </p><br>
	<p>Password: hardcap</p><br>

<p>Cause randomized early game Pokémon events to bias towards a specific type:
	<p>Password: mononormal</p><br>
	<p>Password: monofire</p><br>
	<p>Password: monowater</p><br>
	<p>Password: monograss</p><br>
	<p>Password: monoelectric</p><br>
	<p>Password: monoice</p><br>
	<p>Password: monofighting</p><br>
	<p>Password: monopoison</p><br>
	<p>Password: monoground</p><br>
	<p>Password: monoflying</p><br>
	<p>Password: monobug</p><br>
	<p>Password: monopsychic</p><br>
	<p>Password: monorock</p><br>
	<p>Password: monoghost</p><br>
	<p>Password: monodragon</p><br>
	<p>Password: monodark</p><br>
	<p>Password: monosteel</p><br>
	<p>Password: monofairy</p><br>

<p>Prevent Pokémon from being healed after their HP drops to 0:</p><br>
	<p>Password: nuzlocke</p><br>
	
<p>Randomly reshuffles species and moves as rolled at game start:</p><br>
	<p>Password: randomizer</p><br>
	
<p>Pokémon do not need to know HM (TMX) moves in order to use them in the field:</p><br>
	<p>Password: easyhms</p><br>
	
<p>Prohibits the player's use of items in trainer battles:</p><br>
	<p>Password: noitems</p><br>
	
<p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokémon to have 252 EVs and 31 IVs in all stats:</p><br>
	<p>Password: fullevs</p><br>
	
<p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokémon to have 0 EVs and IVs in all stats:</p><br>
	<p>Password: litemode</p><br>
	
<p>Makes all Field	Notes visible immediately</p><br>
	<p>Password: allfieldapp</p><br>
	
<p>Remove some randomness by making all attacks do consistent damage rather than a roll:</p><br>
	<p>Password: nodamageroll</p><br>

<p>Multiple passwords, including differing monotypes, may be used in tandem with 
each other, but progress at your own risk~</p><br>

<p>Other hidden passwords may be able to be found in the game.</p></div>
