# To Julia

Welcome to my 100% walkthrough. I love this game, I hope you will too, and I hope this walkthrough can help you if you get stuck or if you want to collect everything that you can in the game.

## All Aboard!

The game will first ask you to choose a player character and gender. It will then ask you if you want to view controls. You can actually rebind controls with F1 and even add controller support! Once you've gotten acquainted with your chosen controls, you'll find yourself on the train.

Ame will ask you if you have any special instructions or passwords. From the game's readme:

<div id="quote">
    <p> At the start of the game, you will be prompted for special instructions, or passwords. Below is a list of applicable passwords. Please note that these are features are considered a bonus, and may have some  unexpected interactions at times... 
    </p><br><br>
    <p>Implement a hard EXP cap when maxed on badges, similar to Pokemon Rejuvenation: </p><br>
        <ul><li>Password: hardcap</li></ul><br>
    <p>Cause randomized early game Pokemon events to bias towards a specific type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Password: mononormal</li>
            <li>Password: monofire</li>
            <li>Password: monowater</li>
            <li>Password: monograss</li>
            <li>Password: monoelectric</li>
            <li>Password: monoice</li>
            <li>Password: monofighting</li>
            <li>Password: monopoison</li>
            <li>Password: monoground</li>
            <li>Password: monoflying</li>
            <li>Password: monobug</li>
            <li>Password: monopsychic</li>
            <li>Password: monorock</li>
            <li>Password: monoghost</li>
            <li>Password: monodragon</li>
            <li>Password: monodark</li>
            <li>Password: monosteel</li>
            <li>Password: monofairy</li>
        </ul><br>
    <p>Prevent Pokemon from being healed after their HP drops to 0:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nuzlocke</li></ul><br>
    <p>Randomly reshuffles species and moves as rolled at game start:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: randomizer</li></ul><br>
    <p>Pokemon do not need to know HM (TMX) moves in order to use them in the field:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: easyhms</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Prohibits the player's use of items in trainer battles:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: noitems</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 252 EVs and 31 IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: fullevs</li></ul><br>
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 0 EVs and IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: litemode</li></ul><br>    
    <p>Makes all Field	Notes visible immediately</p>
        <ul><li>Password: allfieldapp</li></ul><br>
    <p>Remove some randomness by making all attacks do consistent damage rather than a roll:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nodamageroll</li></ul><br>
    <p>Multiple passwords, including differing monotypes, may be used in tandem with 
    each other, but progress at your own risk~</p><br><br>
    <p>Other hidden passwords may be able to be found in the game.</p>
</div>

If this is your first time playing, don't worry too much about passwords - in fact you can activate passwords later on into the game if you'd like. 

If you want some of my opinions on these passwords:

- If you want to do a challenge run, try one of the *mono\[type\]* passwords. It doesn't enforce any explicit rules for battle, it simply guarantees you suitable Pokemon for random events. I love to do monotype runs (for example, [here's one I have already completed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonReborn/comments/uh5wnk/i_cleared_the_entirety_of_e19_with_only_water/) ) so I really recommend trying one of these especially for a second playthrough.
- I don't prefer these personally, but you can do *nuzlocke* or *randomizer* if you'd like, just note that Nuzlocke doesn't enforce a first-mon-per-area rule explicitly. You can even do both at the same time.
- *hardcap* lets you avoid disobeying via overlevelling, and *easyhms* allows you to use HM's without teaching them to your Pokemon.  I think it is worthwhile to play the game without these two to get the "classic" reborn experience at least once, but if you know you'd prefer the quality of life that comes with these passwords feel free to use them.
- *noitems* makes it so you can't use in battle items like Potion and X-Attack. I prefer this for the extra difficulty it provides and how it increases the value of moves like Recover.
- *nodamagerolls* makes it so moves will always roll the same damage. There are some fights in this game you practically must reset for a couple times at least, so minimizing the randomness is in my opinion pretty handy.
- *fullevs* ramps up the difficulty significantly by making every Pokemon both hit hard and have some bulk. I only recommend this for players with experience.
- *allfieldapp* lets you see data about fields from the start. If you're following this guide I'll be picking up all the notes naturally anyways, so unless you really want to know right away how each field works you'll be ok skipping this one.
- *litemode* is a good choice if you are struggling or want to experience the wonderful characters, world, and puzzles without as much emphasis on battling prowess.

Regardless, *this guide will be from the perspective of a player who is using no passwords.* 

After you're done inputting passwords, enjoy the rest of your train ride!

## Grand Hall

As soon as you're off the train, you'll have a conversation with Ame and Julia. I won't be explaining story events much at all in this walkthrough. This conversation does quietly show off a mechanic in Pokemon Reborn: relationship points! Certain dialogue triggers and events will make certain characters like you more or less. What do they do? [Ame's Devblog post](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/development/records/about-relationship-points-r83/) explains it pretty well, so you can read that to decide if you want to care about them or not.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Julia)
- No (Neutral)

Immediately down from your starting position, in a rock you'll find a hidden *Normal Gem*. There are tons of hidden items in this game, and we won't get the Itemfinder for another two badges or so. I will try my best to explain the positions of all the hidden items that I can until then.

Heading to the right, you'll see a black and green streetsign. Two tiles to the right is a pile of trash containing a hidden *Poke Ball*. To the right you'll find a manhole cover - on the left side is a hidden *Red Shard*. Shards will actually be pretty useful in Reborn for obtaining Ability Capsules and Pokemon as well as learning moves via move tutors.

Proceed to the right into Opal Ward. A girl at the bottom of the area will give you a *Potion*. In general, talk to as many people in Reborn as you can - they offer helpful tips for battles, give you useful items, etc.

If the weather is sunny you will see an Ice Cream Cart here.

Opal Ward Ice Cream Shop

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$600       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$800       |
|*Blue Moon Ice Cream*\*|$20000     |

Every day the Ice Cream Shop appears, there is a 1 in 21 chance that they will be selling the rare Blue Moon Ice Cream. If you talk to them and they are not, then they will not carry Blue Moon Ice Cream until the next sunny day. However, if you save before speaking to them, you can reset the game until they are carrying Blue Moon Ice Cream. It is too expensive for us right now by far, but should you ever want to buy it keep this trick in mind.

Talk to the girl in front of the big building here, and you'll head in. Welcome to the Grand Hall.

Upstairs, you'll be asked which starter Pokemon you'd like to get. You actually get to choose between 21 starters, or you can let fate decide by using the computer at the top of the room. One amazing thing about Reborn is that you can obtain every single Pokemon in the first seven generations within a single savefile of Reborn without trading, and that includes the starters. So, regardless of which you pick, you'll be able to get the other 20 eventually. Your choices are:
- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**

One amazing feature that Pokemon Reborn has is that it doesn't arbitrarily lock each Pokemon's 'hidden' ability behind weird methods. Every Pokemon has an equal chance of having its Hidden Ability as its normal abilities regardless of how you obtain them. That means you can get Intimidate Litten, Sheer Force Totodile, Contrary Snivy and more right now. It is ultimately up to you what you choose of course. Many players recommend Torchic due to its Speed Boost ability, but each starter can be useful in its own way.

If you save in front of the starters (quicksave is, by default, 'D'), you can reset (resetting is, by default, F12. You will become very familiar with this button.) until you get one with satisfactory nature, ability, IV's, and even shininess. The shiny rate in this game is roughly 1 in 91 in this game, so you might just end up with a shiny starter on your first try!

Talk to Ame as soon as you're done, and you'll be taken downstairs and fight your first battle!

Pretty Boy Cain. Field: No Field
- Nidoran M., Lv. 5, Ability: Hustle, Bashful Nature, IVs: 3
    - Tackle
    - Leer
  
Use your starter's stat lowering move once if you'd like then spam your attacking move and hopefully you can win. Note that winning this one is not required, but if you win, you'll get Relationship Points (+1 Cain).

Once you are done with that battle, you'll be healed, then thrust into another without changing things up. While this isn't too bad right now, this will happen more in this game. One thing I should note is that if you spam the quicksave key specifically while a character is moving, you can save between battles. 

Apprentice Victoria. Field: No Field
- Litten, Lv. 5, Ability: Blaze, Bashful Nature, IVs: 10
    - Scratch
    - Growl

You'll be Lv. 6 now if you won the last one. Use a similar strategy and hopefully you'll come out on top. Note that again winning this one is not required, but if you win, you'll get Relationship Points (+1 Victoria).

After the battle, Ame will give you the *Pokedex*, the *Pokegear,* and of course the *Running Shoes*! Plus, Victoria will give you 5 *Pokeballs*.

Now, we can explore the Grand Hall. This is the region's hub building - we will be checking back here often. 

Talk to the guy in the top left - he will tell us about the password *litemode*. We already knew about this one from the readme, but you can enter it in the future if you'd like.

A guy behind the desk will allow us to bring in grinding trainers to the grand hall. Right now they're a bit too tough for us, but we can come back a bit before the gym leader to grind later.

Talk to a guy next to some display cases if you'd like to buy some candy.

Grand Hall Common Candy Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy* | $75       |

As you might guess, Common Candies are the opposite of rare candies - they'll decrease your Pokemon's level. If you're not doing hardcap, they can help us keep your Pokemon under the level cap, thus obeying your commands. Note that the current level cap is 20 - until we beat the gym leader, Pokemon won't obey at Lv. 21 and beyond. We shouldn't need any common candies right now though. To his right is another shop:

Standard Shop (0 Badges)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Pokeball*     |$200       |

In this guide I will be catching every single Pokemon as soon as it becomes available, so if you're going to do the same you're gonna need a lot of Pokeballs. As in the mainline games, you get a *Premier Ball* with every 10 Pokeballs you purchase. In a pinch we can almost always safely return to a Pokemon Center, so buying Potions and Antidotes may be just to save time for now.

On your way out the door, you'll see two people right by the exit. One of them will offer you a Pokemon for $500. But when you do, someone will steal it! If you want to skip this event for now until you have more money you can - we won't actually get to have this Pokemon for... 14 more badges.

That's all we can really do in the Grand Hall for now, so head outside.

## Opal Ward

Note that for now I will not be listing the teams of all of the rando trainers scattered around the region - that would be a lot of content that might not be so useful. If you would like to see the regular trainers, let me know.

Anyways, there is grass here, which means we can obtain new team members! I will be **bolding** any Pokemon that are new.

Opal Ward

|Land (Morning/Day)|%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Rattata**       |30 |**Rattata**       |30 |
|**Bidoof**        |30 |**Meowth**        |20 |
|**Patrat**        |15 |**Ekans**         |20 |
|**Pidgey**        |15 |**Hoothoot**      |17 |
|**Meowth**        |5  |**Spinarak**      |13 |
|**Ekans**         |5  |                  |   |

Specifically I recommend training up Bidoof as soon as possible - it gets Headbutt at Level 13, which allows you to catch Pokemon in trees. We will also be able to trade away Bibarel for a different Pokemon pretty soon, so that's something to keep in mind.

On the left side of the area, in the left broken statue you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*.

Talk to the trainer here with the Snubbull or Stufful, and they will leave. Back at the bottom of the area, you'll now be able to fight trainers to get onto Opal Bridge. I will be going from the left side, clockwise around the bridge. 

Head up and to the left, beating the trainers as you go. A rock in the top left corner contains a hidden *Awakening*. To the right, you'll fight a Gentleman. All the way down from him and one tile to the left contains a hidden *Blue Shard*.

To the right, you'll find three bullies. You'll need two Pokemon to be able to fight the last two, so catch a second if you haven't yet. When you win, you'll get **Pachirisu** or **Zigzagoon**, randomly determined. Note that whenever there is a random event like this, you will be able to get the other one(s) later in the game. The *monoelectric* password would guarantee Pachirisu, for example, while *mononormal* would guarantee Zigzagoon. If you got Zigzagoon, you can train that up instead of Bidoof if you'd like for Headbutt which it learns at level 11.

The first rock you see down from here contains a hidden *Antidote*. After defeating the trainers that's pretty much all we can do here, so head back towards the train station.

## Lower Peridot Ward

In the Lower Peridot Ward, things have opened up! Head up as soon as you can. A rock on the left side will contain a hidden *Escape Rope*. Talk to the guy here, and give him $150 total. We can't do anything in the house behind him quite yet, so head up from here. 

You'll find a gym here. We can't go in yet, but if you go up and around to the right, you'll find a *Gift Box*. 

Also, specifically when the weather is thunderstorming, you'll find **Blitzle** here. Since it's Lv. 15 it might be a bit too tough to deal with right now, so you can come back later. Note that this is the first encounter that is only possible with the right weather - if you'd like to avoid having to wait you can use the *weathermod* password at your next opportunity.

To the left, you'll find a couple of black and green street signs. All the way down and one tile to the right of the top-left sign, you'll find a hidden *Paralyze Heal*. 

To the left, you'll find another Pokemon Center. The rock just outside to the left contains a hidden *Elemental Seed*. Hang on to this for now - it will be useful later on. In a house to the left, you can take a quiz to find out what kind of Pokemon you'd be, just for fun. Enneagram? Myers-Briggs? Nah. *This* is the real personality quiz.

Anyways, down and to the right from here you'll find some more trainers. During a clear daytime, you'll find a Teddiursa! It will run off and we'll have to chase it. 

Immediately above this intersection you'll find a pile of trash paper on the left side, between two girders. One tile up and one tile right from that contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

There's nothing else here for now, so head down and left from this area and enter the first house that you can. Inside, you'll find a *Pokesnax*! This item is crucial for getting certain Pokemon. Back outside, go one tile left and all the way down. In the final tile you can stand on is a hidden *Exp. Candy XS*. 

Head back up and to the right, and you'll find another trainer. The building directly above him has a pile of trash paper to its right, which contains a hidden *Blue Shard*. Up from here, in a box you can find a hidden *Common Candy*. Since we are holding the snax, talk to the dumpster next to it to catch **Gulpin**. Inside the house, also thanks to the snax, you'll be able to catch **Whismur**. 

Return to the guy we gave money to - behind him in a house you will find **Minccino** or **Espurr**, randomly determined. With the snax in your bag, it will join you! 

Head to the left of the Pokemon center, and go down. In a house, a guy will give you the *Old Rod*! 

Back outside, we can actually fish in the dirty water.

Lower Peridot Ward

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Grimer**        |100|

You can talk to the group below if you'd like, but you can't do anything here quite yet. To the right, you'll find a building to the left and up of the snax house. Inside, you'll be able to battle a guy. If you win, he'll let you into his pool, where you can find a *Sea Incense*.

Lower Peridot Ward Pool

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Goldeen**       |70 |
|**Finneon**       |30 |

Head out, and back up past the Old Rod house. You'll find the Name Rater's house here. Up from here, the first barrel you see will hide a *Heart Scale*. Straight to the left and down between the two brown buildings you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*. 

If it is still a clear daytime, here you'll be able to talk to Teddiursa again, who will run off to a random location. I will cover all the locations later on, but keep in mind finding it three times from here will allow you to battle and catch it.

Enter the building here and talk to the old man for a battle. If you win, you'll be able to enter his garden. 

Seacrest's Garden

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Ledyba**        |30 |**Caterpie**      |30 |Hoothoot          |30 |
|**Cherubi**       |24 |**Wurmple**       |30 |Spinarak          |24 |
|**Wurmple**       |20 |**Sunkern**       |30 |**Wurmple**       |20 |
|**Caterpie**      |20 |**Cherubi**       |10 |**Caterpie**      |20 |
|**Sunkern**       |6  |                  |   |**Sunkern**       |6  |

There is a trade for Sunkern we can do later on, so I recommend catching one.

Back outside, head to the right. Enter the first building here. You'll find out about an injured Skitty - when we get an Oran Berry we will be back. Head outside and go right.

You'll fight a trainer in a small park. Once you beat her, talk to her again for a *Rose Incense*. Down and to the left from here you'll find a *Paralyze Heal* hidden in a box.

Back up from here, enter the building. Talk to the guy here and give him the Gift Box we found earlier, and you'll obtain a **Delibird**! The building to the right of this one contains an ailing **Kricketot** which you can obtain by talking to the person here. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Accept Kricketot (+1 Shelly)
- Reject Kricketot (-1 Shelly)

Kricketune with its Fury Cutter attack and Technician ability can be incredible in the early game, so consider using it.

Back outside, talk to the yellow haired guy for a battle. When you beat him you can access the Lower Peridot Alley.

Lower Peridot Alley

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Trubbish**      |60 |
|**Stunky**        |22 |
|**Poochyena**     |18 |

Poochyena evolves early and can have the Moxie ability, so it can be fantastic in the early game.

To the right of the blue bin is a hidden *Dark Gem*. After defeating the trainer on the left you'll get a *Super Potion*. During thunderstorms specifically, you'll be able to get **Tynamo**!

Head outside and go to the right under the bridge. When the weather is rainy, you'll find **Pansear** or **Panpour**, randomly determined. The second from the right box on the bottom row contains a *Purple Shard*. Head to the right.

Underground Railnet

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Noibat**        |74 |
|**Woobat**        |20 |
|Stunky            |6  |

Woobat can be pretty solid if you evolve it early thanks to its Simple ability.

Plus, a rock at the top left contains a hidden *Guard Spec.* Once you're done here, head back to the left and go up past Seacrest's Garden to enter the northern part of Peridot Ward.

## Peridot Ward

Between two boxes on the left, you can find a hidden *Pokeball*. In a rock up and to the right from here is a hidden *Oran Berry*. That means we can head back down and enter the first building on the right to get **Skitty**. 

Head back up, then go left. To the left of the factory there is a barrel containing an *Ability Capsule*! Make sure you get it soon because it will eventually become unobtainable.

To the right of here is a trainer with a red hat. Depending on where he challenges you you may need to go around, but between a rock and a barrel above him you'll find a hidden *Burn Heal*. The barrel on the other side of this small building contains a hidden *Red Shard* The in-game trade I mentioned earlier is in this house, but we probably aren't quite ready for it yet, so head up.

Up and to the left of the rock above the street sign you can find a hidden *Blue Shard*, and straigh up from here the top of two boxes contains a *Paralyze Heal*. Up from here go left, then in a rock behind a dumpster you can get a hidden *Calcium*. I really recommend selling it for a clean $4900 - if you haven't noticed the trainers in this area don't give you much money.

Defeat the youngsters here and enter this house. A lady will tell you she is afraid of some muggers who aren't here yet, so we can head outside. The fountain out here will actually contain **Surskit** when it is raining. Two tiles down from the left part of the manhole cover here you can find a hidden *Ether*. 

Up from here, when the weather is clear or sunny, as long as you are holding Rose Incense you can catch a falling **Budew**. A rock above contains a *Potion* and one to the left contains a *Red Shard*.

Inside this house you'll find the guy who stole our Pokemon earlier, but you gotta pay another $500! Just kidding, you gotta fight both him and the initial salesman and you won't even get your Pokemon. We'll just have to continue this quest later.

Head down and enter the tall building to your right. Inside two suspicious people will see you and run off. Back in the Igglybuff lady's house you'll have to defeat them. Once you do, you can get **Igglybuff**! Anyways, to the right of the tall building you can defeat another blonde haired guy to get access to another alleyway.

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Trubbish          |45 |
|Poochyena         |34 |
|**Purrloin**      |21 |

In a jar to the left you can find a *Repel*. A box above will contain a *Green Shard*. Our first *Data Chip* is above. You can use it to add a password at any PC, if you'd like.

Outside, enter the small building to the left and pickup the *Potion*. Outside, head straight to the left, and enter the first building. At night, you can catch **Grubbin** or **Joltik**, randomly determined.

Straight to the left out the door you'll find some trash paper, and to the left of it is a hidden *Common Candy*. Inside the next building is another *Common Candy*. 

The "Standard Shops" in this game operate similarly to main Pokemon game shops in that they update their inventory based on how many badges you have - the Peridot Ward one will have the same inventory as the Grand Hall one until we get a badge, then they will both upgrade. 

Anyways, a small house up from here contains a *Protein*, which again I recommend selling for more ball money. Outside to the right in a box is a hidden *Potion*. A pile of trash paper in the very top left contains a hidden *Clever Wing* (which, again, is good to sell). A guy in the adjacent building will give us a *Common Candy*. Outside there is a shop.

Peridot Ward Snax Shop

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|Pokesnax   |$650       |

If you use up your Pokesnax and need more, this is the place. Note that he won't be here unless the weather is clear or sunny. 

In the "Jasper" gate here you can find a *Genius Wing* in a rock. Outside you'll find a hidden *Green Shard* a tile to the right of the pair of trash paper tiles. To the right past the trainer a rock contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

Now that we've completed this loop, head back to the bottom left corner of the area. Inside both sides of the dumpster you'll find a *Blue Shard* and *Common Candy*. 

When you're ready, talk to the green haired guy for a battle.

- Sandile, Lv. 13, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 10
    - Power Trip
    - Snatch
    - Rage
    - Sand Tomb
- Rowlet, Lv. 14, Ability: Overgrow, IVs: 15
    - Leafage
    - Peck
    - Ominous Wind
    - Confuse Ray

This one is a bit harder than the first two rival fights of course, but nothing you can't handle. Watch out for his Budew, who likes to heal, and his Sandile who can rip through your team of six thanks to Moxie if you're not careful.

Around this time, my Bidoof was able to learn Headbutt, so there are a few Pokemon you can now obtain. First, head to the garden:

Seacrest's Garden

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Swablu**        |55 |
|**Burmy**         |45 |

Note that we will eventually want a Mothim for an in-game trade. Next, head back to Opal Ward.

Opal Ward 

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Pineco**        |40 |
|**Spearow**       |30 |
|**Combee**        |30 |

Now is a good time to finish the Teddiursa quest if you haven't already. Keep in mind this has to be done on a clear day. After talking to it in the bottom part of the Lower Peridot Ward and then again on the left side near the Name Rater's house, you'll need to find it three more times. It can be found in one of the following locations, then will be found in the two after it in the list (cyclically).

1. Nearby the train station, where we started the game.
2. Under the Opal Bridge, nearby Panpour/Pansear. 
3. Above Mosswater Industrial in between two buildings.
4. Next to the Upper Peridot Ward Pokemart.
5. Next to the rock containing the Calcium near the fountain.
6. Nearby the dumpster where we got Gulpin.
7. In the bottom left corner of Seacrest's garden.

**Teddiursa** will then battle you. 

With that out of the way, time to progress the story. Make sure you have your best team for some battles coming up.

You have to two choices: you can head straight to the Mosswater Industrial above Seacrest's Garden, or take a detour first to the Lower Peridot Ward gym. In either case, talk to the character standing in front of the factory when you're ready.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Headed straight to Mosswater Industrial (Fern +1)
- Detoured to Lower Peridot Gym before going to Mosswater (Julia +1)

## Mosswater Industrial

Time for our first dungeon proper! Fern will join us as a partner - note that if you leave the factory before completing it, you will lose Relationship Points (-1 Fern) the first time. However, talking to Fern while he is following you will grant Relationship Points (+1 Fern) the first time you do it, as well. Another cool thing is that partners will heal you after each battle!

Enter the next room and talk with Ace. We'll be wandering around the factory, defeating Team Meteor Grunts and looking for codes. 

To the left across a bridge, you'll see one flashing terminal: XX7X. In the top left you'll find another terminal: X1XX. The three terminals nearby give us some lore that will be relevant later... A terminal to the right shows 3XXX, and the one in the top right corner shows XXX9. Read the other two terminals nearby for more lore, then head down to the elevator and type in our now completed password.

On the second floor, Rini will start us off with part of the second password: XX6X. Before we proceed, head out the door on the bottom right and follow the path to get an *Exp. Candy S*. Back in the main room, head out to the right, and interact with the terminal here to get the hint XXX2, and the other for lore. Head out to the left, and down at the first opportunity. In this room, use the terminal to discover the hint X8XX. Back outside, go left. In here is another terminal: 4XXX, plus one more with some lore. Back outside again, go up at the bridge, pickup *Paralyze Heal*, type in the code and head in. Beat the grunts and pickup the explosives!

Back in the central room, choose which of the two characters to talk to.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Julia after getting the boomies (+1 Julia, -1 Florinia)
- Talk to Florinia after getting the boomies (-1 Julia, +1 Florinia)

Either way, head in to the room at the top when you're ready for a fight.

Meteor Private Aster and Meteor Private Eclipse. Field: Factory Field
- Rockruff, Lv. 16, Ability: Steadfast, IVs: 31
    - Thunder Fang
    - Howl
    - Bite
    - Rock Throw
- Rockruff, Lv. 16, Ability: Vital Spirit, IVs: 31
    - Fire Fang
    - Howl
    - Bite
    - Rock Throw

Depending on what Pokemon you have this can be a bit difficult since they like to one-shot Fern's Budew, but your sheer numbers can probably overwhelm them regardless.

Outside the factory, Florinia will ask you a question.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Florinia)
- No (Neutral)

You will then be given the Field Notes App in your Pokegear, and offered to turn on a graphical feature that shows off field effect boosts in battle. I recommend doing this! You will also be given the *Electric Terrain Readout*. Anyways, if you noticed, we were battling on the Factory Field earlier. Most of the important trainers in this game we will be fighting on these custom field effects, so the Field Notes will be very helpful.

Before we continue with the story, there are a couple quests we can take care of now. 

Head down and talk to the purple haired guy above the train station. A hotshot will steal his painkillers! Follow him inside the North Peridot Alley, where you can fight him. Once you defeat him, return to the guy who will give you 5 *Exp. Candy S*. Nice.

By now hopefully you've been able to evolve your Bidoof into **Bibarel** at Lv. 15. If so, head into the house across from Mosswater to do an in-game trade for **Munna**! If not, now is a good time to grind the repeatable trainers in the upper-right corner of the Grand Hall - remember, they will give you Exp. Candy after each battle and even auto-heal your party! You can also do this as you like to do last preparations for the gym.

## Volt Badge

Enter the Neo-Circuit Power-Plant gym when you're ready. Beat all the trainers in this main room, talk to the Voltorb standing behind them, and blow up the barriers one by one. When you're ready, talk to the gym leader in her room.

Cheer Captain Julia (2x Potion). Field: Electric Terrain.
- Minun, Lv. 12, Ability: Minus, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Charge Beam
    - Encore
    - Quick Attack
- Geodude (Geodude-Alola), Lv. 12, Ability: Galvanize, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Self-Destruct
    - Tackle
    - Charge
    - Rollout
- Voltorb, Lv. 12, Ability: Aftermath, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Explosion
    - Rollout
    - Charge Beam
    - Sonic Boom
- Plusle, Lv. 13, Ability: Lightning Rod, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Charge Beam
    - Encore
    - Quick Attack
- Oricorio (Oricorio-Pom-Pom), Lv. 14, Ability: Dancer, Quirky Nature, IVs: 10
    - Work Up
    - Tailwind
    - Pound
    - Air Cutter
- Electrode, Lv. 15, Ability: Aftermath, Bashful Nature, IVs: 24
    - Charge Beam
    - Sonic Boom
    - Rollout
    - Charge

Pokemon Reborn's first gym leader comes in pretty hot. You'll notice that she mostly uses two strategies across her team: stacking Special Attack with Charge Beam and wearing out your Lv. 20 and under Pokemon quickly with Sonic Boom. Her Electrode of course is very fast, and can employ both of these strategies effectively and then take out a chunk of your HP on the way out with Aftermath. Geodude and Voltorb also like to explode, and since the former's is boosted by STAB, Galvanize, and the field... it's gonna hurt. It doesn't help that Oricorio can hit hard and boost the speed of the entire team for a few turns.

Her team luckily isn't super bulky, so trying to get something going with your own sweepers might be the key. Kricketune and Mightyena can really shine here, as well as your second stage starter especially with Torrent / Blaze / Overgrow. The single Elemental Seed we got earlier may be a good thing to try because of the Speed boost it grants to your Pokemon. Alternatively, if you got Zigzagoon you can use Mud Sport to destroy the field, making things a bit more even for you.

Once you emerge victorious, you'll be given the *Volt Badge* as well as *TM57 Charge Beam*. TM's are infinite-use, so slap it on anything that can learn it. You also get to go up to Lv. 25 now! Great job completing section 1 of Pokemon Reborn!

# To Florinia

## Obsidia Ward

Head outside, and talk to Victoria outside the gym. She'll tell us our next destination is to the east of the Grand Hall.
