# Section 1

Welcome to my walkthrough.

## All Aboard!

The game will first ask you to choose a player character and gender. It will then ask you if you want to view controls.You can actually rebind controls with F1 and even add controller support! Once you've gotten acquainted with your chosen controls, you'll find yourself on the train.

Ame will ask you if you have any special instructions or passwords. From the game's readme:

<div id="quote">
    <p> At the start of the game, you will be prompted for special instructions, or passwords. Below is a list of applicable passwords. Please note that these are features are considered a bonus, and may have some  unexpected interactions at times... 
    </p><br><br>
    <p>Implement a hard EXP cap when maxed on badges, similar to Pokemon Rejuvenation: </p><br>
        <ul><li>Password: hardcap</li></ul><br>
    <p>Cause randomized early game Pokemon events to bias towards a specific type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Password: mononormal</li>
            <li>Password: monofire</li>
            <li>Password: monowater</li>
            <li>Password: monograss</li>
            <li>Password: monoelectric</li>
            <li>Password: monoice</li>
            <li>Password: monofighting</li>
            <li>Password: monopoison</li>
            <li>Password: monoground</li>
            <li>Password: monoflying</li>
            <li>Password: monobug</li>
            <li>Password: monopsychic</li>
            <li>Password: monorock</li>
            <li>Password: monoghost</li>
            <li>Password: monodragon</li>
            <li>Password: monodark</li>
            <li>Password: monosteel</li>
            <li>Password: monofairy</li>
        </ul><br>
    <p>Prevent Pokemon from being healed after their HP drops to 0:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nuzlocke</li></ul><br>
    <p>Randomly reshuffles species and moves as rolled at game start:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: randomizer</li></ul><br>
    <p>Pokemon do not need to know HM (TMX) moves in order to use them in the field:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: easyhms</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Prohibits the player's use of items in trainer battles:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: noitems</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 252 EVs and 31 IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: fullevs</li></ul><br>
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 0 EVs and IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: litemode</li></ul><br>    
    <p>Makes all Field	Notes visible immediately</p>
        <ul><li>Password: allfieldapp</li></ul><br>
    <p>Remove some randomness by making all attacks do consistent damage rather than a roll:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nodamageroll</li></ul><br>
    <p>Multiple passwords, including differing monotypes, may be used in tandem with 
    each other, but progress at your own risk~</p><br><br>
    <p>Other hidden passwords may be able to be found in the game.</p>
</div>

If this is your first time playing, don't worry too much about passwords - in fact you can activate passwords later on into the game if you'd like. 

If you want some of my opinions on these passwords:

- If you want to do a challenge run, try one of the *mono\[type\]* passwords. It doesn't enforce any explicit rules for battle, it simply guarantees you suitable Pokemon for random events.
- I don't prefer these personally, but you can do *nuzlocke* or *randomizer* if you'd like, just note that Nuzlocke doesn't enforce a first-mon-per-area rule explicitly. You can even do both at the same time.
- *hardcap* lets you avoid disobeying via overlevelling, and *easyhms* allows you to use HM's without teaching them to your Pokemon. I think it is worthwhile to play the game without these two to get the "classic" reborn experience at least once, but if you know you'd prefer the quality of life that comes with these passwords feel free to use them.
- *noitems* makes it so you can't use in battle items like Potion and X-Attack. I prefer this for the extra difficulty it provides and how it increases the value of moves like Recover.
- *nodamagerolls* makes it so moves will always roll the same damage. There are some fights in this game you practically must reset for a couple times at least, so minimizing the randomness is in my opinion pretty handy.
