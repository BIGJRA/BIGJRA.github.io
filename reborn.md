# Reborn, the City of Ruin

Welcome to my 100% walkthrough. I love this game, I hope you will too, and I hope this walkthrough can help you if you get stuck or if you want to collect everything that you can in the game.

Unfortunately by nature of how complete this guide is, there are some parts that may spoil events that happen further down the line a bit. I try to be vague about these things as best as possible, but you may want to consider playing the game once first without referencing this walkthrough.

Oh, and as a fun fact - the first 18 main content headers (like the one above) are the titles to the first 18 episodes of the game. Episode 19 is the final version of the game hence does not have one, so I had to make my own from then on.

## All Aboard!

The game will first ask you to choose a player character and gender. It will then ask you if you want to view controls. You can actually rebind controls with F1 and even add controller support! Once you've gotten acquainted with your chosen controls, you'll find yourself on the train.

Ame will ask you if you have any special instructions or passwords. From the game's readme:

<div id="quote">
    <p> At the start of the game, you will be prompted for special instructions, or passwords. Below is a list of applicable passwords. Please note that these are features are considered a bonus, and may have some  unexpected interactions at times... 
    </p><br><br>
    <p>Implement a hard EXP cap when maxed on badges, similar to Pokemon Rejuvenation: </p><br>
        <ul><li>Password: hardcap</li></ul><br>
    <p>Cause randomized early game Pokemon events to bias towards a specific type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Password: mononormal</li>
            <li>Password: monofire</li>
            <li>Password: monowater</li>
            <li>Password: monograss</li>
            <li>Password: monoelectric</li>
            <li>Password: monoice</li>
            <li>Password: monofighting</li>
            <li>Password: monopoison</li>
            <li>Password: monoground</li>
            <li>Password: monoflying</li>
            <li>Password: monobug</li>
            <li>Password: monopsychic</li>
            <li>Password: monorock</li>
            <li>Password: monoghost</li>
            <li>Password: monodragon</li>
            <li>Password: monodark</li>
            <li>Password: monosteel</li>
            <li>Password: monofairy</li>
        </ul><br>
    <p>Prevent Pokemon from being healed after their HP drops to 0:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nuzlocke</li></ul><br>
    <p>Randomly reshuffles species and moves as rolled at game start:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: randomizer</li></ul><br>
    <p>Pokemon do not need to know HM (TMX) moves in order to use them in the field:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: easyhms</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Prohibits the player's use of items in trainer battles:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: noitems</li></ul><br> 
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 252 EVs and 31 IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: fullevs</li></ul><br>
    <p>Sets all opposing trainer Pokemon to have 0 EVs and IVs in all stats:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: litemode</li></ul><br>    
    <p>Makes all Field	Notes visible immediately</p>
        <ul><li>Password: allfieldapp</li></ul><br>
    <p>Remove some randomness by making all attacks do consistent damage rather than a roll:</p>
        <ul><li>Password: nodamageroll</li></ul><br>
    <p>Multiple passwords, including differing monotypes, may be used in tandem with 
    each other, but progress at your own risk~</p><br><br>
    <p>Other hidden passwords may be able to be found in the game.</p>
</div>

If this is your first time playing, don't worry too much about passwords - in fact you can activate passwords later on into the game if you'd like. 

If you want some of my opinions on these passwords:

- If you want to do a challenge run, try one of the *mono\[type\]* passwords. It doesn't enforce any explicit rules for battle, it simply guarantees you suitable Pokemon for random events. I love to do monotype runs (for example, [here's one I have already completed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonReborn/comments/uh5wnk/i_cleared_the_entirety_of_e19_with_only_water/) ) so I really recommend trying one of these especially for a second playthrough.
- I don't prefer these personally, but you can do *nuzlocke* or *randomizer* if you'd like, just note that Nuzlocke doesn't enforce a first-mon-per-area rule explicitly. You can even do both at the same time.
- *hardcap* lets you avoid disobeying via overlevelling, and *easyhms* allows you to use HM's without teaching them to your Pokemon.  I think it is worthwhile to play the game without these two to get the "classic" reborn experience at least once, but if you know you'd prefer the quality of life that comes with these passwords feel free to use them.
- *noitems* makes it so you can't use in battle items like Potion and X-Attack. I prefer this for the extra difficulty it provides and how it increases the value of moves like Recover.
- *nodamagerolls* makes it so moves will always roll the same damage. There are some fights in this game you practically must reset for a couple times at least, so minimizing the randomness is in my opinion pretty handy.
- *fullevs* ramps up the difficulty significantly by making every Pokemon both hit hard and have some bulk. I only recommend this for players with experience.
- *allfieldapp* lets you see data about fields from the start. If you're following this guide I'll be picking up all the notes naturally anyways, so unless you really want to know right away how each field works you'll be ok skipping this one.
- *litemode* is a good choice if you are struggling or want to experience the wonderful characters, world, and puzzles without as much emphasis on battling prowess.

Regardless, *this guide will be from the perspective of a player who is using no passwords.* 

After you're done inputting passwords, enjoy the rest of your train ride!

## Grand Hall

As soon as you're off the train, you'll have a conversation with Ame and Julia. I won't be explaining story events much at all in this walkthrough. This conversation does quietly show off a mechanic in Pokemon Reborn: relationship points! Certain dialogue triggers and events will make certain characters like you more or less. What do they do? [Ame's Devblog post](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/development/records/about-relationship-points-r83/) explains it pretty well, so you can read that to decide if you want to care about them or not. Whenever a choice is not listed, it has no effect on the points.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Julia)

Immediately down from your starting position, in a rock you'll find a hidden *Normal Gem*. There are tons of hidden items in this game, and we won't get the Itemfinder for another two badges or so. I will try my best to explain the positions of all the hidden items that I can until then.

Heading to the right, you'll see a black and green streetsign. Two tiles to the right is a pile of trash containing a hidden *Poke Ball*. To the right you'll find a manhole cover - on the left side is a hidden *Red Shard*. Shards will actually be pretty useful in Reborn for obtaining Ability Capsules and Pokemon as well as learning moves via move tutors.

Proceed to the right into Opal Ward. A girl at the bottom of the area will give you a *Potion*. In general, talk to as many people in Reborn as you can - they offer helpful tips for battles, give you useful items, etc.

If the weather is sunny you will see an Ice Cream Cart here.

Opal Ward Ice Cream Shop

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$600       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$800       |
|*Blue Moon Ice Cream*\*|$20000     |

Every day the Ice Cream Shop appears, there is a 1 in 21 chance that they will be selling the rare Blue Moon Ice Cream. If you talk to them and they are not, then they will not carry Blue Moon Ice Cream until the next sunny day. However, if you save before speaking to them, you can reset the game until they are carrying Blue Moon Ice Cream. It is too expensive for us right now by far, but should you ever want to buy it keep this trick in mind.

Talk to the girl in front of the big building here, and you'll head in. Welcome to the Grand Hall.

Upstairs, you'll be asked which starter Pokemon you'd like to get. You actually get to choose between 21 starters, or you can let fate decide by using the computer at the top of the room. One amazing thing about Reborn is that you can obtain every single Pokemon in the first seven generations within a single savefile of Reborn without trading, and that includes the starters. So, regardless of which you pick, you'll be able to get the other 20 eventually. Your choices are:
- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**

One amazing feature that Pokemon Reborn has is that it doesn't arbitrarily lock each Pokemon's 'hidden' ability behind weird methods. Every Pokemon has an equal chance of having its Hidden Ability as its normal abilities regardless of how you obtain them. That means you can get Intimidate Litten, Sheer Force Totodile, Contrary Snivy and more right now. It is ultimately up to you what you choose of course. Many players recommend Torchic due to its Speed Boost ability, but each starter can be useful in its own way.

If you save in front of the starters (quicksave is, by default, 'D'), you can reset (resetting is, by default, F12. You will become very familiar with this button.) until you get one with satisfactory nature, ability, IV's, and even shininess. The shiny rate in this game is roughly 1 in 91 in this game, so you might just end up with a shiny starter on your first try!

Talk to Ame as soon as you're done, and you'll be taken downstairs and fight your first battle!

Pretty Boy Cain. Field: No Field
- Nidoran M., Lv. 5, Ability: Hustle, Bashful Nature, IVs: 3
    - Tackle
    - Leer
  
Use your starter's stat lowering move once if you'd like then spam your attacking move and hopefully you can win. Note that winning this one is not required. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Cain in battle (+1 Cain)

Once you are done with that battle, you'll be healed, then thrust into another without changing things up. While this isn't too bad right now, this will happen more in this game. One thing I should note is that if you spam the quicksave key specifically while a character is moving, you can save between battles. 

Apprentice Victoria. Field: No Field
- Litten, Lv. 5, Ability: Blaze, Bashful Nature, IVs: 10
    - Scratch
    - Growl

You'll be Lv. 6 now if you won the last one. Use a similar strategy and hopefully you'll come out on top. Note that again winning this one is not required.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Victoria in battle (+1 Victoria)

After the battle, Ame will give you the *Pokedex*, the *Pokegear,* and of course the *Running Shoes*! Plus, Victoria will give you 5 *Poke Balls*.

Now, we can explore the Grand Hall. This is the region's hub building - we will be checking back here often. 

Talk to the guy in the top left - he will tell us about the password *litemode*. We already knew about this one from the readme, but you can enter it in the future if you'd like.

A guy behind the desk will allow us to bring in grinding trainers to the grand hall. Right now they're a bit too tough for us, but we can come back a bit before the gym leader to grind later.

Talk to a guy next to some display cases if you'd like to buy some candy.

Grand Hall Common Candy Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy* | $75       |

As you might guess, Common Candies are the opposite of rare candies - they'll decrease your Pokemon's level. If you're not doing hardcap, they can help us keep your Pokemon under the level cap, thus obeying your commands. Note that the current level cap is 20 - until we beat the gym leader, Pokemon won't obey at Lv. 21 and beyond. We shouldn't need any common candies right now though. To his right is another shop:

Default Mart (0 Badges)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

In this guide I will be catching every single Pokemon as soon as it becomes available, so if you're going to do the same you're gonna need a lot of balls. As in the mainline games, you get a *Premier Ball* with every 10 balls you purchase. In a pinch we can almost always safely return to a Pokemon Center, so buying Potions and Antidotes may be just to save time for now.

On your way out the door, you'll see two people right by the exit. One of them will offer you a Pokemon for $500. But when you do, someone will steal it! If you want to skip this event for now until you have more money you can - we won't actually get to have this Pokemon for... 14 more badges.

That's all we can really do in the Grand Hall for now, so head outside.

## Opal Ward

Note that for now I will not be listing the teams of all of the rando trainers scattered around the region - that would be a lot of content that might not be so useful. If you would like to see the regular trainers, let me know.

Anyways, there is grass here, which means we can obtain new team members! I will be **bolding** any Pokemon that are new.

Opal Ward

|Land (Morning/Day)|%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Rattata**       |30 |**Rattata**       |30 |
|**Bidoof**        |30 |**Meowth**        |20 |
|**Patrat**        |15 |**Ekans**         |20 |
|**Pidgey**        |15 |**Hoothoot**      |17 |
|**Meowth**        |5  |**Spinarak**      |13 |
|**Ekans**         |5  |                  |   |

Specifically I recommend training up Bidoof as soon as possible - it gets Headbutt at Level 13, which allows you to catch Pokemon in trees. We will also be able to trade away Bibarel for a different Pokemon pretty soon, so that's something to keep in mind. There is also an in-game trade for Watchog a little bit down the road, so you may want to consider at least catching a Patrat for now.

On the left side of the area, in the left broken statue you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*.

Talk to the trainer here with the Snubbull or Stufful, and they will leave. Back at the bottom of the area, you'll now be able to fight trainers to get onto Opal Bridge. I will be going from the left side, clockwise around the bridge. 

Head up and to the left, beating the trainers as you go. A rock in the top left corner contains a hidden *Awakening*. To the right, you'll fight a Gentleman. All the way down from him and one tile to the left contains a hidden *Blue Shard*.

To the right, you'll find three bullies. You'll need two Pokemon to be able to fight the last two, so catch a second if you haven't yet. When you win, you'll get **Pachirisu** or **Zigzagoon**, randomly determined. Note that whenever there is a random event like this, you will be able to get the other one(s) later in the game. The *monoelectric* password would guarantee Pachirisu, for example, while *mononormal* would guarantee Zigzagoon. If you got Zigzagoon, you can train that up instead of Bidoof if you'd like for Headbutt which it learns at level 11.

The first rock you see down from here contains a hidden *Antidote*. After defeating the trainers that's pretty much all we can do here, so head back towards the train station.

## Lower Peridot Ward

In the Lower Peridot Ward, things have opened up! Head up as soon as you can. A rock on the left side will contain a hidden *Escape Rope*. Talk to the guy here, and give him $150 total. We can't do anything in the house behind him quite yet, so head up from here. 

You'll find a gym here. We can't go in yet, but if you go up and around to the right, you'll find a *Gift Box*. 

Also, specifically when the weather is thunderstorming, you'll find **Blitzle** here. Since it's Lv. 15 it might be a bit too tough to deal with right now, so you can come back later. Note that this is the first encounter that is only possible with the right weather - if you'd like to avoid having to wait you can use the *weathermod* password at your next opportunity.

To the left, you'll find a couple of black and green street signs. All the way down and one tile to the right of the top-left sign, you'll find a hidden *Paralyze Heal*. 

To the left, you'll find another Pokemon Center. The rock just outside to the left contains a hidden *Elemental Seed*. Hang on to this for now - it will be useful later on. In a house to the left, you can take a quiz to find out what kind of Pokemon you'd be, just for fun. Enneagram? Myers-Briggs? Nah. *This* is the real personality quiz.

Anyways, down and to the right from here you'll find some more trainers. During a clear daytime, you'll find a Teddiursa! It will run off and we'll have to chase it. 

Immediately above this intersection you'll find a pile of trash paper on the left side, between two girders. One tile up and one tile right from that contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

There's nothing else here for now, so head down and left from this area and enter the first house that you can. Inside, you'll find a *Pokesnax*! This item is crucial for getting certain Pokemon. Back outside, go one tile left and all the way down. In the final tile you can stand on is a hidden *Exp. Candy XS*. 

Head back up and to the right, and you'll find another trainer. The building directly above him has a pile of trash paper to its right, which contains a hidden *Blue Shard*. Up from here, in a box you can find a hidden *Common Candy*. Since we are holding the snax, talk to the dumpster next to it to catch **Gulpin**. Inside the house, also thanks to the snax, you'll be able to catch **Whismur**. 

Return to the guy we gave money to - behind him in a house you will find **Minccino** or **Espurr**, randomly determined. With the snax in your bag, it will join you! 

Head to the left of the Pokemon center, and go down. In the top of two trash paper tiles you can find a *Poison Gem*. In a house below, a guy will give you the *Old Rod*! 

Back outside, we can actually fish in the dirty water.

Lower Peridot Ward

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Grimer**        |100|

You can talk to the group below if you'd like, but you can't do anything here quite yet. To the right, you'll find a building to the left and up of the snax house. Inside, you'll be able to battle a guy. If you win, he'll let you into his pool, where you can find a *Sea Incense*.

Lower Peridot Ward Pool

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Goldeen**       |70 |
|**Finneon**       |30 |

Head out, and back up past the rod guy's house. You'll find the Name Rater's house here. Up from here, the first barrel you see will hide a *Heart Scale*. Straight to the left and down between the two brown buildings you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*. 

If it is still a clear daytime, here you'll be able to talk to Teddiursa again, who will run off to a random location. I will cover all the locations later on, but keep in mind finding it three times from here will allow you to battle and catch it.

Enter the building here and talk to the old man for a battle. If you win, you'll be able to enter his garden. 

Seacrest's Garden

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Ledyba**        |30 |**Caterpie**      |30 |Hoothoot          |30 |
|**Cherubi**       |24 |**Wurmple**       |30 |Spinarak          |24 |
|**Wurmple**       |20 |**Sunkern**       |30 |**Wurmple**       |20 |
|**Caterpie**      |20 |**Cherubi**       |10 |**Caterpie**      |20 |
|**Sunkern**       |6  |                  |   |**Sunkern**       |6  |

There is a trade for Sunkern we can do later on, so I recommend catching one.

Back outside, head to the right. Enter the first building here. You'll find out about an injured Skitty - when we get an Oran Berry we will be back. Head outside and go right.

You'll fight a trainer in a small park. Once you beat her, talk to her again for a *Rose Incense*. A rock below her in the park contains an *Antidote*, and down and to the left from here you'll find a *Paralyze Heal* hidden in a box.

Back up from here, enter the building. Talk to the guy here and give him the Gift Box we found earlier, and you'll obtain a **Delibird**! The building to the right of this one contains an ailing **Kricketot** which you can obtain by talking to the person here. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Accept Kricketot (+1 Shelly)
- Reject Kricketot (-1 Shelly)

Kricketune with its Fury Cutter attack and Technician ability can be incredible in the early game, so consider using it.

Back outside, talk to the yellow haired guy for a battle. When you beat him you can access the Lower Peridot Alley.

Lower Peridot Alley

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Trubbish**      |60 |
|**Stunky**        |22 |
|**Poochyena**     |18 |

Poochyena evolves early and can have the Moxie ability, so it can be fantastic in the early game.

To the right of the blue bin is a hidden *Dark Gem*. After defeating the trainer on the left you'll get a *Super Potion*. During thunderstorms specifically, you'll be able to get **Tynamo**!

Head outside and go to the right under the bridge. When the weather is rainy, you'll find **Pansear** or **Panpour**, randomly determined. The second from the right box on the bottom row contains a *Purple Shard*. Head to the right.

Underground Railnet (Opal Area)

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Noibat**        |74 |
|**Woobat**        |20 |
|Stunky            |6  |

Woobat can be pretty solid if you evolve it early thanks to its Simple ability.

Plus, a rock at the top left contains a hidden *Guard Spec.* Once you're done here, head back to the left and go up past Seacrest's Garden to enter the northern part of Peridot Ward.

## Peridot Ward

Between two boxes on the left, you can find a hidden *Poke Ball*. In a rock up and to the right from here is a hidden *Oran Berry*. That means we can head back down and enter the first building on the right to get **Skitty**. 

Head back up, then go left. To the left of the factory there is a barrel containing an *Ability Capsule*! Make sure you get it soon because it will eventually become unobtainable.

To the right of here is a trainer with a red hat. Depending on where he challenges you you may need to go around, but between a rock and a barrel above him you'll find a hidden *Burn Heal*. The barrel on the other side of this small building contains a hidden *Red Shard* The in-game trade I mentioned earlier is in this house, but we probably aren't quite ready for it yet, so head up.

Up and to the left of the rock above the street sign you can find a hidden *Blue Shard*, and straight up from here the top of two boxes contains a *Paralyze Heal*. Up from here go left, then in a rock behind a dumpster you can get a hidden *Calcium*. I really recommend selling it for a clean $4900 - if you haven't noticed the trainers in this area don't give you much money.

Defeat the youngsters here and enter this house. A lady will tell you she is afraid of some muggers who aren't here yet, so we can head outside. The fountain out here will actually contain **Surskit** when it is raining. Two tiles down from the left part of the manhole cover here you can find a hidden *Ether*. 

Up from here, when the weather is clear or sunny, as long as you are holding Rose Incense you can catch a falling **Budew**. A rock above contains a *Potion* and one to the left contains a *Red Shard*.

Inside this house you'll find the guy who stole our Pokemon earlier, but you gotta pay another $500! Just kidding, you gotta fight both him and the initial salesman and you won't even get your Pokemon. We'll just have to continue this quest later.

Head down and enter the tall building to your right. Inside two suspicious people will see you and run off. Back in the Igglybuff lady's house you'll have to defeat them. Once you do, you can get **Igglybuff**! Anyways, to the right of the tall building you can defeat another blonde haired guy to get access to another alleyway.

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Trubbish          |45 |
|Poochyena         |34 |
|**Purrloin**      |21 |

In a jar to the left you can find a *Repel*. A box above will contain a *Green Shard*. Our first *Data Chip* is above. You can use it to add a password at any PC, if you'd like.

Outside, enter the small building to the left and pickup the *Potion*. Outside, head straight to the left, and enter the first building. At night, you can catch **Grubbin** or **Joltik**, randomly determined. Note that this will use up one of your snax, so you'll need to buy more to do other snax-related events.

Straight to the left out the door you'll find some trash paper, and to the left of it is a hidden *Common Candy*. Inside the next building is another *Common Candy*. 

The "Default Marts" in this game operate similarly to main Pokemon game shops in that they update their inventory based on how many badges you have - the Peridot Ward one will have the same inventory as the Grand Hall one until we get a badge, then they will both upgrade. 

Anyways, a small house up from here contains a *Protein*, which again I recommend selling for more ball money. Outside to the right in a box is a hidden *Potion*. A pile of trash paper in the very top left contains a hidden *Clever Wing* (which, again, is good to sell). A guy in the adjacent building will give us a *Common Candy*. Outside there is a shop.

Peridot Ward Snax Shop

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|*Pokesnax* |$650       |

If you use up your Pokesnax and need more, this is the place. Note that he won't be here unless the weather is clear or sunny. 

In the "Jasper" gate here you can find a *Genius Wing* in a rock. Outside you'll find a hidden *Green Shard* a tile to the right of the pair of trash paper tiles. To the right past the trainer a rock contains a hidden *Purple Shard*.

Now that we've completed this loop, head back to the bottom left corner of the area. Inside both sides of the dumpster you'll find a *Blue Shard* and *Common Candy*. 

When you're ready, talk to the green haired guy for a battle.

Swag Jockey Fern (Potion). Field: No Field
- Budew, Lv. 13, @Oran Berry, Ability: Poison Point, IVs: 10
    - Mega Drain
    - Natural Gift
    - Stun Spore
    - Covet
- Sandile, Lv. 13, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 10
    - Power Trip
    - Snatch
    - Rage
    - Sand Tomb
- Rowlet, Lv. 14, Ability: Overgrow, IVs: 15
    - Leafage
    - Peck
    - Ominous Wind
    - Confuse Ray

This one is a bit harder than the first two rival fights of course, but nothing you can't handle. Watch out for his Budew, who likes to heal, and his Sandile who can rip through your team of six thanks to Moxie if you're not careful.

Around this time, my Bidoof was able to learn Headbutt, so there are a few Pokemon you can now obtain. First, head to the garden:

Seacrest's Garden

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Swablu**        |55 |
|**Burmy**         |45 |

Note that we will eventually want a Mothim for an in-game trade, so ensure you catch a Male Burmy at some point. Next, head back to Opal Ward.

Opal Ward 

|Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Pineco**        |40 |
|**Spearow**       |30 |
|**Combee**        |30 |

Now is a good time to finish the Teddiursa quest if you haven't already. Keep in mind this has to be done on a clear day. After talking to it in the bottom part of the Lower Peridot Ward and then again on the left side near the Name Rater's house, you'll need to find it three more times. It can be found in one of the following locations, then will be found in the two after it in the list (cyclically).

1. Nearby the train station, where we started the game.
2. Under the Opal Bridge, nearby Panpour/Pansear. 
3. Above Mosswater Industrial in between two buildings.
4. Next to the Upper Peridot Ward Pokemart.
5. Next to the rock containing the Calcium near the fountain.
6. Nearby the dumpster where we got Gulpin.
7. In the bottom left corner of Seacrest's garden.

**Teddiursa** will then battle you. 

With that out of the way, time to progress the story. Make sure you have your best team for some battles coming up.

You have to two choices: you can head straight to the Mosswater Industrial above Seacrest's Garden, or take a detour first to the Lower Peridot Ward gym. In either case, talk to the character standing in front of the factory when you're ready.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Headed straight to Mosswater Industrial (Fern +1)
- Detoured to Lower Peridot Gym before going to Mosswater (Julia +1)

## Mosswater Industrial

Time for our first dungeon proper! Fern will join us as a partner. Partners are special in this game for a few reasons. Leaving your partner (here, leaving Mosswater Industrial) has a negative effect:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Leave Fern and exit the factory (-1 Fern, just once)

However, talking to your partner while they're walking with you has a positive effect:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Fern while you are together (+1 Fern, just once)
  
Another cool thing is that partners will heal you after each battle!

Enter the next room and talk with Ace. We'll be wandering around the factory, defeating Team Meteor Grunts and looking for codes. 

To the left across a bridge, you'll see one flashing terminal: XX7X. In the top left you'll find another terminal: X1XX. The three terminals nearby give us some lore that will be relevant later... A terminal to the right shows 3XXX, and the one in the top right corner shows XXX9. Read the other two terminals nearby for more lore, then head down to the elevator and type in our now completed password.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Push the same elevator button as the floor you are on (-1 Fern)

On the second floor, Rini will start us off with part of the second password: XX6X. Before we proceed, head out the door on the bottom right and follow the path to get an *Exp. Candy S*. Back in the main room, head out to the right, and interact with the terminal here to get the hint XXX2, and the other for lore. Head out to the left, and down at the first opportunity. In this room, use the terminal to discover the hint X8XX. Back outside, go left. In here is another terminal: 4XXX, plus one more with some lore. Back outside again, go up at the bridge, pickup *Paralyze Heal*, type in the code and head in. Beat the grunts and pickup the explosives!

Back in the central room, choose which of the two characters to talk to.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Julia after getting the boomies (+1 Julia, -1 Florinia)
- Talk to Florinia after getting the boomies (-1 Julia, +1 Florinia)

Either way, head in to the room at the top when you're ready for a fight.

Meteor Private Aster and Meteor Private Eclipse. Field: Factory Field
- Rockruff, Lv. 16, Ability: Steadfast, IVs: 31
    - Thunder Fang
    - Howl
    - Bite
    - Rock Throw
- Rockruff, Lv. 16, Ability: Vital Spirit, IVs: 31
    - Fire Fang
    - Howl
    - Bite
    - Rock Throw

Depending on what Pokemon you have this can be a bit difficult since they like to one-shot Fern's Budew, but your sheer numbers can probably overwhelm them regardless.

Outside the factory, Florinia will ask you a question.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Florinia)

You will then be given the Field Notes App in your Pokegear, and offered to turn on a graphical feature that shows off field effect boosts in battle. I recommend doing this! You will also be given the *Electric Terrain Readout*. Anyways, if you noticed, we were battling on the Factory Field earlier. Most of the important trainers in this game we will be fighting on these custom field effects, so the Field Notes will be very helpful.

Before we continue with the story, there are a couple quests we can take care of now. 

Go to the factory area where we first met Fern, and talk to the scientist guy on the right side of the factory. He will give us the *Factory Field Readout*, so now we have more details whenever we have battles on the Factory Field that was in Mosswater.

Head down and talk to the purple haired guy above the train station. A hotshot will steal his painkillers! Follow him inside the North Peridot Alley, where you can fight him. Once you defeat him, return to the guy who will give you 5 *Exp. Candy S*. Nice.

By now hopefully you've been able to evolve your Bidoof into **Bibarel** at Lv. 15. If so, head into the house across from Mosswater to do an in-game trade for **Munna**! If not, now is a good time to grind the repeatable trainers in the upper-right corner of the Grand Hall - remember, they will give you Exp. Candy after each battle and even auto-heal your party! You can also do this as you like to do last preparations for the gym.

## Volt Badge

Enter the Neo-Circuit Power-Plant gym when you're ready. Beat all the trainers in this main room, talk to the Voltorb standing behind them, and blow up the barriers one by one. When you're ready, talk to the gym leader in her room.

Cheer Captain Julia (2x Potion). Field: Electric Terrain.
- Minun, Lv. 12, Ability: Minus, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Charge Beam
    - Encore
    - Quick Attack
- Geodude (Geodude-Alola), Lv. 12, Ability: Galvanize, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Self-Destruct
    - Tackle
    - Charge
    - Rollout
- Voltorb, Lv. 12, Ability: Aftermath, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Explosion
    - Rollout
    - Charge Beam
    - Sonic Boom
- Plusle, Lv. 13, Ability: Lightning Rod, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Charge Beam
    - Encore
    - Quick Attack
- Oricorio (Oricorio-Pom-Pom), Lv. 14, Ability: Dancer, Quirky Nature, IVs: 10
    - Work Up
    - Tailwind
    - Pound
    - Air Cutter
- Electrode, Lv. 15, Ability: Aftermath, Bashful Nature, IVs: 24
    - Charge Beam
    - Sonic Boom
    - Rollout
    - Charge

Pokemon Reborn's first gym leader comes in pretty hot. You'll notice that she mostly uses two strategies across her team: stacking Special Attack with Electric Terrain boosted Charge Beam, and wearing out your Lv. 20 and under Pokemon quickly with Sonic Boom. Her Electrode of course is very fast, and can employ both of these strategies effectively and then take out a chunk of your HP on the way out with Aftermath. Geodude and Voltorb also like to explode, and since the former's is boosted by STAB, Galvanize, and the field... it's gonna hurt. It doesn't help that Oricorio can hit hard and boost the speed of the entire team for a few turns.

Her team luckily isn't super bulky, so trying to get something going with your own sweepers might be the key. Kricketune and Mightyena can really shine here, as well as your second stage starter especially with Torrent / Blaze / Overgrow. The single Elemental Seed we got earlier can grant a Speed boost to the Pokemon holding it, which can be a key component of your strategy. Alternatively, if you got Zigzagoon you can use Mud Sport to destroy the field, making things a bit more even for you.

Once you emerge victorious, you'll be given the *Volt Badge* as well as *TM57 Charge Beam*. TM's are infinite-use, so slap it on anything that can learn it. You also get to go up to Lv. 25 now! Great job completing section 1 of Pokemon Reborn!

# Reap What's Been Sewn

## 1 Badge Quests

Head outside, and talk to Victoria outside the gym. She'll tell us our next destination is to the east of the Grand Hall.

Before we continue though, there are a couple quests we can complete before we proceed to the next area. 

Head nearby the train station in Lower Peridot. While it is raining, if you have a snax in your bag you can give it away to get **Numel**! 

Nearby you'll find a hiker. Talk to him, then talk to the person in the house containing Whismur earlier on. Return to the hiker and follow him to the house to receive **Onix**!

Next, enter the Grand Hall. The Common Candy salesman is now gone but in his place is a person who will give us the *Rainbow Field* readout. You probably can't do much with this one yet, but once you are able to create the Rainbow Field yourself, you do lots of crazy things in battle on it.

Now that we have a badge, Pokemarts will be updated:

Default Mart (1 Badge)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Repel*        |$400       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

Having a couple repels never hurts, but money is still scarce and catching them all is an expensive task, so I still recommend focusing mostly on balls.

You'll also notice that there are more trainers on Opal Bridge - when you get a new badge, this often happens, so watch out!

## Obsidia Ward

When you're ready, talk to Victoria on the right side of Opal Bridge. New area time!

Head into the Central Salon. Inside, you'll find a friendship checker as well as a groomer who will raise your Pokemon's friendship for $1500. Do this once if you have the money. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Get at least one massage at the Central Salon (+1 Serra)

A lady on the right will ask to see a Pokemon with maximum friendship. Your starter is likely here by now if it's stayed in your party the whole game so far, you've done all the sidequests, and you haven't let it faint too much. If you do show her one, you'll get the *Soothe Bell*! Helpful if you want to accelerate the evolution of your Igglybuff, Woobat, etc.

The building to the right is Critical Capture, where you can buy custom balls.

Critical Capture Shop Right Clerk

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Heavy Ball*   |$300       |
|*Moon Ball*    |$300       |
|*Fast Ball*    |$300       |
|*Love Ball*    |$400       |
|*Nest Ball*    |$500       |
|*Net Ball*     |$500       |
|*Dive Ball*    |$500       |
|*Timer Ball*   |$1000      |
|*Friend Ball*  |$3000      |

Most of these are really not too worth it right now compared to the regular variety (especially Friend Ball... yikes) but I recommend picking up a few Love Balls - their 4x catch rate can be activated 100% of the time given you're trying to catch a non-genderless Pokemon and you have at least 1 male and at least 1 female Pokemon in your party, helpful for Pokemon with lower catch rates we may encounter.

Outside, head right and up. Enter the Pokemon Center, and talk to both the girl on the left and the mother on the right to activate some quests.

Enter the building to the right, and talk to the daycare couple one-by-one over and over until they drop their facade and battle you. Eventually, we will be freeing the real daycare couple! 

In a house to the left, we'll learn about an in-game trade we can't complete just yet. Head outside and to the left, grab a hidden *Steel Gem* in a rock, and go down the stairs to access a new part of the railnet.

Underground Railnet (Obsidia Area)

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Noibat            |60 |
|Woobat            |20 |
|**Klink**         |20 |

Klink is pretty good on the Factory Field which we'll be seeing a lot in this game.

There is also an *Escape Rope* hidden in the left area.

Head back out and enter the Devon Corp building on the main street.

Devon Corp Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Potion*         |$300       |
|*Repel*          |$400       |
|*Poke Ball*      |$200       |

Nothing special here for sale, but if you talk to the mysterious salesman, he'll give you a free *Premier Ball* the first time. 

The next building in line is the Sweet Kiss Candy Shop building. In the top left corner, you can complete a puzzle to get **Swirlix**! The completed puzzle looks like this:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/swirlix.jpg"/>

At the top, a kid really wants some Vanilla Ice Cream. Since he's blocking the machine though we can't get any here - you'll have to wait until it's sunny and buy some from Opal Ward. Give it to this kid and then buy a Vanilla Ice Cream for $1000 from the vending machine - it will be a **Vanillite** in disguise! After this the vending machine will be normal again.

Sweet Kiss Ice Cream Vending Machine Shop

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$700       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$1000      |

There is a 1% chance you will actually get a *Blue Moon Ice Cream* whenever you buy any one of these. Choc and Berry are more expensive here than in Opal Ward, so there's really no reason to buy these here ever.

Sweet Kiss Top Clerk Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Whipped Dream*    |$1000      |
|*Peppermint*       |$600       |
|*Chewing Gum*      |$800       |
|*Pop Rocks*        |$750       |
|*Salt-Water Taffy* |$850       |
|*Red-Hots*         |$850       |
|*Cotton Candy*     |$5000      |

If you're planning on evolving Swirlix, grab a Whipped Dream. Cotton Candy functions as a Revive, but is very expensive. The rest are just expensive versions of the status healing items, but all raise friendship.

Sweet Kiss Bottom Clerk Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy*     |$150       |
|*Exp. Candy XS*    |$500       |
|*Rare Candy*       |$12000     |

I don't think you need to spend your precious money on Exp. Candy since grinding trainers give them every time you beat them.

Back outside, follow Victoria to the right. If you'd like to get to battle Victoria and potentially get a point with her in a bit, talk to Florinia. 

Two tiles south of the nearby statue you'll find a *Pokesnax*, and another *Pokesnax* is hidden down and to the right, above the upper right part of the rightmost building. Head back to the left and go down towards the South Obsidia Ward! The tile above the bottommost dancing vine contains a hidden *Potion*.

Enter the building here and talk to the guy here. His Lillipup will run off - we will have to chase it. As I did with Teddiursa, I will come back to it once we can access all the locations. For now, exit the building. Two tiles to the right, you'll find a hidden *Dire Hit*. 

Head down from here. Between the first two girders is a hidden *Blue Shard*, and past the trainer in the first box you can find a hidden *Green Shard*. 

While it's windy, you can catch wild **Hoppip** here! Anyways, enter the slums.

## Obsidia Slums

Grab a *Potion* in the trash can to the left and head up. A box in the upper right corner contains a *Great Ball*. Heading down and to the left, the open toolchest next to the nerd contains a *Pokesnax*; the pot to the left contains a *Red Shard*.

To the left you'll find a Light Shard, which heals your party but disappears after. You can always leave it here for a little while until you need it more, if you'd like.

If you talked to Victoria near the park earlier, head up and talk to Victoria for a battle. If you didn't or you want to skip her battle, talk to the fridge in the upper right corner to delete the barrier.

Apprentice Victoria (2x Potion). Field: No Field 
- Ralts, Lv. 18, @Wise Glasses, Ability: Synchronize, IVs: 31
    - Magical Leaf
    - Confusion

    - Flame Charge
    - Dual Chop
    - Power Trip
    - Bulk Up
Her Torracat likes to try to set up on you, so be careful of that. Otherwise her team isn't anything too crazy - Ralts and Pichu are pretty weak and you can set up on them.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Victoria in the Slums (+1 Victoria)

After that's done, head down the escalator to the right. There are encounters in this area.

Obsidia Slums B1F

|Cave              |%  |

|**Pancham**       |10 |
|**Yungoos**       |10 |
|**Crabrawler**    |10 |

There's an *Oran Berry* in this rock, and a *Great Ball* below. You can sneak between the escalators here - pick up a hidden *Max Repel* in a rock and a *Carbos* (read: $4900) in the next room. We can't progress further here, so go back upstairs and go through the door

A box to the left contains *Pop Rocks*. Defeat the trainer, hop across, defeat another, and pick up the hidden *Rawst Berry* in a rock up here. Head upstairs.

Hop your way to the left, down, pick up a hidden *Potion* in a box here, then go right and pick up the *Moon Stone* here. If you've been dying for Delcatty or Wigglytuff, now's your chance. Anyways, head up the stairs here.

Talk to Corey here, then pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy S* in a jar below. Grab the *Zinc* at the top and head back down.

Make your way to the top right corner of 3F and then head down. In the very bottom right there is a hidden *Ice Heal*.

Head left and emerge onto the roof. There's another Light Shard here - usually they mean either "you're halfway through a dungeon" or "there's a super hard fight coming up". Anyways, follow the path and talk to Mankey in the elevator. Take it to 1F to open a shortcut, then take it to B1F.

Slums B1F Vending Machine Shop

|Item           |Price      |

Sometimes you even get two! Anyways, the jar to the left of the elevator contains a hidden 
*Normal Gem* and the toolchest at the bottom by the youngster contains a *Exp. Candy S*. 

If you talk to this guy, he'll battle you - turns out this is the guy who stole our $1000 Pokemon from the thieves in Peridot! But... he sold it to someone else. To be continued!

Before we enter the big door in here, go left and talk to the second box for hidden *Red-Hots*. In the bottom left corner is a hidden *Green Shard*. You can sneak up and to the left past the elevator, if you do, you can get a hidden *Purple Shard* in the topmost rock.

Enter the gap on the left and pick up the *Friend Ball*. Head back out.

Talk to the box in front of the elevator to watch it scurry away. Enter the elevator and go to 1F. Grab the *Net Ball* and talk to the kid here to make him move. In the elevator again go to 2F to grab *TM60 Quash*. Oh yeah.

Enter the big door back on B1F and head up. Once you see this box move twice, head straight to the right to get a hidden *Oran Berry* in a box. In a trash can at the top of this room you can find a hidden *Poke Ball*. In the next room, it's time for a battle!

Pokemon Gang. Field: No Field
- Scraggy, Lv. 15, Ability: Intimidate, IVs: 15
- Scraggy, Lv. 16, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 10
- Scraggy, Lv. 17, Ability: Shed Skin, IVs: 10
- Scrafty, Lv. 20, Ability: Moxie, IVs: 12

As long as you are able to bully Scrafty when it comes out you should be able to make this work with a team of six.

There's a *Potion* in a rock to the left and a *Blue Shard* in the last rock before leaving the room. In the next room, there's a hidden *Potion* in the box on the left and an *Exp. Candy S* in a rock towards the exit. 

Back in the main basement area, go between the escalators to get a *Cotton Candy*. A rock down from here contains a *Burn Heal*. In the room to the right, you can find a hidden *Antidote*, a *Cheri Berry* in the trashcan downstairs as well as a *Super Potion* lying around and an *Exp. Candy S* in the rock below. 

Back upstairs and in the hub, take the escalator to go up. A box on the right contains an *Awakening*. Head to the right and jump your way through this path, pick up a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* and an *Antidote* in rocks on the right side, and go down. Here you'll find an abandoned egg. When it hatches it will be **Bronzor**, **Ducklett**, or **Drowzee**, determined randomly.

Back in the main hub, talk to the backpacker below to get the grate opened for a shortcut, then head back to where Victoria was arguing with the guy earlier and talk to the trashcan to get a *Pokesnax*.

With that, head back to the top right corner and enter the door. Talk to the Spoink hiding under some beams here. Then we can finally emerge into the daylight! There is a hidden ** two spaces right and two spaces down from the bottom-most rock in this area. Enter Coral Ward at the bottom when you are ready.

## Coral Ward

Welcome to Coral Ward. In the right rock as you enter you can get a *Potion*, then an *Ultra Potion* in a rock to the left of the apartments. Heading down from here you can grab a hidden *Purple Shard* one tile down and one tile right of the bottom left warehouse entrance, and a *Chewing Gum* in the box below. There is a *Repel* in the right rock below the singular house. Finally there is an *Aspear Berry* in a rock between the two warehouses on the right.

Inside the apartment complex at the top, you'll meet Danielle who will give you a quiz. Feel free to go find the answers yourself if you'd like. Otherwise, here they are. Whenever you see the following spoiler bar, highlight the text to view the spoiler.

> 4, 7, 31

As a reward for completing the quiz you'll get the *Misty Terrain Readout*. Useful, since Coral Ward is covered in mist.

In a house below, there is an in-game trade. Raise your Patrat to Lv. 20 to get **Watchog**, then trade it for a **Nosepass**.

On the dock, if it is raining and you have Snax, you can obtain **Lotad**.

Talk to the blue haired girl towards the top.

- Nidorino, Lv. 20, Ability: Rivalry, Adamant Nature, IVs: 10
    - Poison Tail
    - Supersonic
    - Fury Attack
    - Peck

This one isn't too crazy. Notice that Popplio's Icy Wind is boosted by the field, so watch out if you were planning on using anything weak to Ice. Nidorino hits somewhat hard but a Steel type can wall it.

After the battle, you'll be given *TMX1 Cut*!

## Obsidia Park

Return to South Obsidia Ward and use your new TMX to chop down the tree. Thankfully in this game HMs, renamed TMX, can be deleted from your Pokemon at will.

Talk to the kid here - we will reunite him with his mother as soon as we can. Enter the Glazamonia Salon here. If we ever get a Furfrou, we can groom it here. They also offer massages for $2000. A lady here will ask us to investigate the Central Salon for them - we will do so later.

Back in Obsidia Ward, we can actually access one more area before we proceed: at the left end of the ward, chop down the tree and go south. Defeating this trainer gives us access to the Obsidia Alleyway.

Obsidia Alleyway

|Trubbish          |45 |
|**Koffing**       |22 |
|Yungoos           |20 |
|Poochyena         |13 |

There is a hidden *Potion* in the first rock on top, and a *Green Shard* in the box in the top right.

At the top of the area during the morning and day, you'll find a Litleo, who will run off.

At night, you'll see two Mightyena's bullying **Electrike**, who will join you if you can defeat them.

To the left of the area, a **Minun** or a **Plusle** will pop out and join you if you give it snax. You can get both by exiting and re-entering.

If this is a bit too hard for now feel free to skip this one, but if you enter the Underground Railnet from the Obsidia entrance you'll find Litleo and have to fight a strong Pokemon. 

Pokemon Mechanightmare. Field: Cave Field
- Klinklang, Lv. 35, Ability: Clear Body, Modest Nature, IVs: 30
    - Discharge
    - Charge Beam
    - Mirror Shot
    - Autotomize

If you're able to defeat this thing, you'll get **Litleo**!

With all that out of the way, return to the park area and talk to Victoria, Amaria, and Florinia. Head into Obsidia Park. Note that once we are done here we can't re-enter, so if you want the hidden items and such grab them while we're here. All of the Pokemon will be available later, though.

Obsidia Park

|**Sunflora**      |5  |
|Slakoth           |5  |
|**Bonsly**        |5  |

Head to the left and grab an *Oran Berry* in the third bush. Grab the *Poke Ball* beyond the first grunt then go right. A bush here will contain a *Chesto Berry*. Cut the wiggly tree and backtrack. Cut another wiggly tree near the entrance and follow the path. After passing the grey street twice the first bush will contain a *Leppa Berry*. Cut this wiggly tree.

Again we are backtracking to go through the middle path to cut a wiggly tree, then through the left path. Following the newly opened area up, grab a *Pecha Berry* in a bush, then head right to cut a wiggly tree to open up a shortcut!

To the right, you can cut another and follow its path to a fight with a grunt. Straight down from here is a hidden *Super Potion*! Follow the path to watch a scene, but a wiggly tree then head back and up at the road. A bush past the road hides a *Green Shard*.

Cut two more wiggly trees. Before we head left, we can actually sneak up past a tree to reach a building: inside, you'll find *TM54 False Swipe* and the *Warehouse Key*. Back outside, follow a path straight to the left to obtain an *X Sp. Def*  

Back down from here, follow the leftward path. In the second rock you'll find an *Antidote*. Use the Light Shard if you'd like, then prepare for a battle!

Meteor Admin ZEL. Field: Forest Field
- PULSE Tangrowth C, Lv. 22, Ability: Filter, Calm Nature, IVs: 7. Stat Spread: 100/70/200/10/70/160. Typing: Grass/Poison
    - Wrap
    - Vine Whip
    - Acid Spray
    - Mega Drain

This is our first battle with a PULSE! As you can see from its stats (HP/Atk/Def/Spe/SpA/SpD) Tangrowth is pretty slow, which luckily means you can take the chance to cripple it with paralysis or stat debuffs. It doesn't hit ridiculously hard either, so your Pokemon will likely be able to live a few turns before being knocked out, but you do have to be cautious of field-boosted Grass moves. The difficulty lies in its combination of Acid Spray and Mega Drain, as it likes to weaken you then heal back to full. Making sure that you're dealing more damage than it is able to heal will be the key here.

Once you succeed, the vines will recede and we'll be back in the park. A bush to the left contains a hidden *Heart Scale* while sneaking around through the bottom right area of the park will lead you to a rock containing an *Exp. Candy M*.

|                  |   |Sunflora          |5  |                  |   |

Catch a Sentret for an in-game trade, and evolve it by raising it to Lv. 15 to get **Furret**. In the house nearby the Pokemon Center, you can trade it to get **Castform**!

While we're nearby, enter the Pokemon center and talk to the mom inside. Tell her where her son is to get an *Ability Capsule*!

Take another visit to the Central Salon and talk to the people inside. Then return to the Glamazonia Salon and talk to the lady, who'll let you take home **Glameow**. They'll also lower their massage price to $1400. That's not all for this quest though, no. Take your Glameow to the Central Salon and show it to the lady on the right; she'll allow us to battle her.

Posh Suzy. Field: No Field
- Tsareena, Lv. 45, Ability: Queenly Majesty, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Synthesis
    - Aromatherapy
    - Play Rough
    - Trop Kick

Obviously this is a pretty tough fight for this point in the game, feel free to return to it later. Maybe a fire type might be able to lower its stats or something since it resists both of its attack moves?

If you're able to win, you'll get **Bounsweet**!

Heading north from the park, all the way right from the manhole cover you can find a hidden *Super Potion*. 

The first building here is the Department Store. Head inside, we can buy some things.

Department Store 1F Left Shop

|*Ice Heal*     |$250           |

We can also talk to an employee to get the *Membership Card* and the *Department Store Sticker: Porygon*. Each time we get a stamp, we can access another floor of the building. We'll be slowly getting these across our adventure.

Our Pokemon have been getting random EV's so far - if you in the future want to EV train your Pokemon, you can buy these to make the process easier. In Reborn, 20 EVs per berry are lowered instead of the canon 10. Don't worry about them for now - EV training will become a lot easier later on.

Outside, head left and grab hidden *Cotton Candy* and *Red Shard* in some rocks. That's pretty much all we can do in Obsidia for now, but before we continue the story we can take a brief detour back to Coral Ward for some goodies.

The warehouse key we got earlier works on three of the warehouses here. In the left one, you'll find the real daycare couple! By freeing them, the daycare will now be in service for all your breeding needs.

The second warehouse contains a *Macho Brace* as well as **Spoink** randomly hiding in one of the boxes. The third warehouse contains a Meteor Grunt. Talking to him allows us to get a Pokemon later on. Also in here is a **Happiny**!

## Onyx Ward

Head up into Onyx Ward from the northeastern corner of Obsidia. Onyx Ward is pretty small, but there are some things we can do here before challenging the gym.

Head up on the right side. Across from the third lamppost on the sidewalk you can find a hidden *Cheri Berry*. Making your way around to the top left corner past the front of the school, the second tile from the left contains a hidden *Antidote*. The rock below contains a *Carbos* and the rock down from here contains a *Pokesnax*. 

Anyways, we can't yet enter the Move Relearner house, so enter the apartment to the right. Talk to the girl on the left twice - for saving the Daycare couple, she'll give us an egg! It will be one of the following, determined randomly: **Clauncher**, **Seel**, **Remoraid**, **Spheal**, **Clamperl**, or **Frillish**. That's all here for now, so head next door to the game corner.

Onyx Arcade Loto Attendant

|*Reborn Ball*  |5 Matches     |
|*PP Max*       |4 Matches     |
|*PP Up*        |3 Matches     |
|*Max Revive*   |2 Matches     |
|*Full Restore* |1 Matches     |

We don't have a Coin Case yet, so there's not much to do yet. We can play the lottery once a day though. 

Enter the trainer school at the top left entrance. Fern will lock us out, so head outside and defeat the trainer to enter the school at the top right entrance.

This area is mostly linear with a few detours. Talk to every green bookshelf and stray green book that you find lying around - they'll give us lore as well as the answers to some questions we'll need to answer later on.

In the first door upstairs, a guy will give you the *Coin Case*! The next room contains *Protective Pads*. The room after that contains a *Quick Claw*. Talk to a guy staring at the wall in the hallway from the right to open up a door to the left.

In this door, go to the left. Here you'll find the first move tutors.

Onyx Trainer School Move Tutor 1

|Move           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|Iron Defense   |$1000      |
|Snore          |$500       |
|Bind           |$500       |
|Spite          |$250       |

It's worth noting that every move tutor in the game will only charge you once per move - so don't feel bad about deleting a tutor move once you've learned it once since you can go get it back for free.

Onyx Trainer School Move Tutor 2

|Move           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|Magic Coat     |$500       |
|Magic Room     |$500       |
|Wonder Room    |$500       |
|Telekinesis    |$100       |

In the room above there are more tutors!

Head upstairs to grab the *Desert Field Readout*!

Head downstairs from here, head out to the main hall and go downstairs again.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Hardy)

Enter the door above and to the right and talk to the girl for a *Telluric Seed*. Unlock this gate for a backtrack shortcut.

Head to the left. Defeat these trainers then head into the room on the left. Time for another rival battle.

Swag Jockey Fern (2x Super Potion). Field: No Field
- Sandile, Lv. 23, Ability: Moxie, Bashful Nature, IVs: 20
    - Mud-Slap
    - Bite
    - Sand Attack
    - Rage
- Roselia, Lv. 24, Ability: Poison Point, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Leech Seed
    - Stun Spore
    - Mega Drain
    - Poison Sting
- Dartrix, Lv. 25, Ability: Overgrow, Bashful Nature, IVs: 28
    - Pluck
    - Razor Leaf
    - Ominous Wind
    - Nature Power

Fern can be tough to defeat now that his Budew and Rowlet have evolved. Roselia likes to try to tank your attacks and heal back thanks to Leech Seed and Mega Drain, while Dartrix tries to hit hard with its STABs or go for an omniboost. Sandile can sweep with Moxie if you're not careful, so lead with something that can handle it and you should be fine.

Before we continue to the gym, now is a good time to wrap up a couple of quests and areas. 

First, head on over to the Arcade. With our Coin Case, we can now go to town here. Note that by interacting with NPC's and random tiles throughout, you can pick up 1065 Coins for free.

Onyx Arcade Coin Shop

|Item       |Price          |
|-----------|---------------|
|50 Coins   |$1000          |
|500 Coins  |$10000         |

Unless you're coming back here really late in the game, don't buy coins. They're way too expensive and by playing Voltorb Flip, you can get them for free. You can also play the slots or the roulette... but these are really slow and Voltorb Flip is 100% the way to go here. The magic number to get all the rewards is 23900 Coins.

Speaking of Voltorb Flip, here are the tips I recommend as a long time Voltorb Flip Player:

1. You can use a calculator to get started with learning what optimal moves are, but in general your coins over time is best served by just playing the game quickly yourself. Even when you lose, it's not too hard to pick back up and try again, even if you get shot all the way down to Level 1. 
2. The game often forces you to make guesses, sometimes 50-50 guesses even. Try to make the guesses that have the least chance of failure first when you find yourself in a no-guarantees situation.
3. Any row (or column, I will call them rows for simplicity) that adds up to 5 can be entirely ignored since there are no 2's and 3's. The only times you should intentionally flip 1's are when you are 100% sure they are not Voltorbs and simply want to make the board have less unflipped tiles.
4. Any rows without Voltorb should be flipped immediately. When there are no such rows... just make your best guess as to where 2's and 3's are in the rows with the least Voltorb probabilities and go from there.
5. It is crucial that you learn what the remaining point values in a row is. For example, in a row with 8/2V, suppose you have flipped one tile and it is a 3. Then in 4 remaining spots, two are Voltorb, so the other two sum to 5. This means one is a 2 and one is a 3, meaning you can try to pick which columns can fit the 2 at that spot and which could fit the 3. Alternatively, in a 5/1V, the minute you see a 2 flipped, you are done, since the rest can then only be 1 or Voltorb.
6. Have fun! It is a bit frustrating when you get to Level 7 and then immediately flip a Voltorb, going all the way back. But the most important thing is fun - remember you can come back later to play and get the rewards.

Onyx Arcade TM Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*TM45 Attract*     |1000 Coins |
|*TM42 Facade*      |4000 Coins |
|*TM90 Substitute*  |7000 Coins |

Of these, Substitute is probably the best one, but you can certainly get some mileage out of the other two with the right Pokemon.

Onyx Arcade Pokemon Shop

|Pokemon        |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|**Snover**     |600 Coins  |
|**Slugma**     |1000 Coins |
|**Mantyke**    |1800 Coins |
|**Nidoran M**  |3500 Coins |
|**Shinx**      |5000 Coins |

Even if you're not interested in getting everything here, most of these Pokemon are good for the upcoming gym. If the egg we previously got was Remoraid, you can get Mantyke and immediately evolve it which is neat. Nidoran M also can immediately evolve twice with the Moon Stone we got earlier. Snover can generate Snow Warning if you'd like to use that to your advantage.

Back outside, head into the building to the left. Fern's friend will feel bad and let us access the rooftop garden. Up here you'll find *TM63 Embargo*.

Onyx Ward Rooftop

|Land              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Bellsprout        |35 |
|**Tranquill**     |25 |
|Pidove            |20 |
|Spearow           |10 |
|Venonat           |10 |

When the weather is clear up here, you can also find a **Pichu** behind a tree if you have snax in your bag.

There is another event we can do, but it only works on certain weekday nights. For now, we have access to three alleyways. You'll need to go to any one of the following: 

- Obsidia Alleyway, on a Monday night
- North Peridot Alleyway, on a Thursday night
- Lower Peridot Alleyway, on a Friday night

Whichever you go to at the right time, you'll find a **Zangoose** digging through the trash that you can catch.

Finally, now is a good time to go finish the search for Lillipup.

After talking to it in the apartment in South Obsidia Ward it will randomly go to one of these five places:

- On the second pier from the top in Coral Ward
- To the left and up from the Central Salon in Obsidia Ward
- Between the Panpour / Pansear area and the Railnet in Opal Ward
- At the very north point of Peridot Ward by the closed gate
- In the northwest corner of Peridot Ward, nearby the apartment containing Snubbull / Stufful

Once you find it, head back to the Onyx Ward. To the left of the Move Relearner house, you'll see the owner with it. You can then obtain **Lillipup**.

## Canopy Badge

With all that out of the way we can head back to the gym. In order to battle Florinia, we're gonna need to answer all the quiz questions. The answers are here, from right to left:

> 1, 367, True, 410, True, 37, 15, True

Head to the left and enter the gym room for a battle.

This is a pretty neat and out of the ordinary team that helps teach the player about the versatility of field effects. In general, the Desert Field actually doesn't really benefit Grass types or most grass type moves. Regardless, Florinia's team is mostly built around using the field successfully. Specifically, Needle Arm, Pin Missile, and Sand Tomb are all boosted by the field, and most of her Pokemon have access to these moves. Cacnea's Sand Veil is always activated here, and Ferroseed's Telluric Seed allows it to gain a bit more bulk and speed in exchange for being trapped by Sand Tomb. Sandstorm lasts for eight turns on the field, and Ferroseed, Cacnea, and Cradily will all be immune to its damage while you may not. Cradily also gets a Special Defense boost from the sand, adding to its already strong bulk with Stockpile and Recover. On top of all that, Nature Power turns into boosted Sand Tomb, and Cottonee has priority on this move due to Prankster!

All that goes to show how even fields that aren't *obviously* beneficial like Electric Terrain for Julia can lead to difficult teams. Aside from Pin Missile Linoone you don't really have many options to abuse the field yourself yet, so the key will be to overwhelming her. Fury Cutter is a pretty great move for this fight - you can get around Ferroseed's Iron Barbs with the Protective Pads we found earlier, and after a few uses the move will tear through Cradily before it can bulk up. Snover is also a good option if you want to cancel out the Sandstorm with a different weather condition, or you could use Castform's Sunny Day to sweep with Fire moves under the 8-turn Desert Field sun. You could also try to run a Flying-type offensive core, which ignores Sand Tomb and can pretty easily deal with everything except Cradily. You might have to think outside the box a little but this fight is fun to figure out, and you can do it.

After winning you'll get the *Canopy Badge* as well as *TM96 Nature Power*. You'll also receive the *PULSE Dex* as well as the *PULSE Readout 5C*. The level cap also shoots up to 35!

## 2 Badge Quests

There are a few things we can do now that we have 2 badges before we continue the story. First, head to the room containing the nurse in the Trainer School. A girl towards the left side will trade you battle advice for *TM100 Confide*!  

Now that we have 2 badges, the Pokemarts have updated inventory now:

Default Mart (2 Badges)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Super Potion* |$700       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Super Repel*  |$700       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

Head to Obsidia Park. While it's sunny outside and you have snax in your bag, you can catch a stationary **Petilil**!

Head into the Obsidia Slums. Nearby where we first entered on the first floor, you'll see a doctor talking to a child. Talk to him to get the *Itemfinder*! Note that this is a limited time event, so if you don't want to have to wait until we get four more badges to get the Itemfinder, act now! Since I assume you can use the itemfinder now, going forward in this guide, I will not describe exact locations of hidden items. You'll also find an *Exp. Candy M* here.

Head left and take the elevator down to B1F. Immediately head left and go up, following the path. If you have snax in your bag, you can catch **Makuhita**!

Back in Opal Ward, specifically if you randomly got Clamperl earlier in Onyx Ward, a person near the water at the bottom will give you a *Deepseatooth* or a *Deepseascale*, randomly determined.

Finally, head to the apartment in the top left corner of Peridot Ward. Now that we have two badges we can finally take home **Snubbull** or **Stufful**, randomly determined.

## Jasper Ward & Malchous Forest Park

Leave this house, and head into the Jasper gate to your right. Talk to the guard here and head into Jasper Ward.

Jasper Ward

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Beedrill**      |25 |
|**Sewaddle**      |24 |
|**Scatterbug**    |20 |
|Pidgey            |20 |
|**Carnivine**     |7  |
|**Pidgeotto**     |4  |

Talk to Corey and Heather here, then head into the police station. Talk to the chief here, who will tell you about his missing officers. You don't have to find them, but doing so is the first step to doing the more exclusive postgame story route. If you'd like to play the route of the game that involves not finding the officers in time, you can skip finding one of the officers until you complete up to the end of this section, then find them afterwards to get the quest rewards.

In general, I will mention story splits and how choices affect post-game route availability just so you can keep your options open.

Grab a hidden *Super Potion* outside then enter the building here, then exit through the top. Outside you'll find a Pokemon Center as well as a hidden *Antidote* and *Ether*. During a clear morning or day, you can talk to an **Emolga** to battle and catch it.

Head back down into the building below and exit to the left. Pick up a hidden *Pecha Berry* and continue into the next building. Head outside at the bottom.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (+1 Heather)
- No (-1 Heather)

Head to the left into the Forest Park.

Malchous Forest Park

|                  |   |Carnivine         |1  |                  |   |

Head towards the center of the area, and chop the wiggly tree nearby. Following the path that this opens up, you can grab hidden *X Speed, Full Heal,* and *Telluric Seed*. Chop the two wiggly trees nearby and receive a *Super Potion* from Heather.

Double back around to the path on top, defeat a grunt then chop the tree. Down from here you can now head left, so battle a grunt and proceed. 

Down from here you'll find some stairs leading to some grunts - but there is a secret passageway hidden to the left behind a tree. Follow this path to get a hidden *Revive* as well as an egg. When it hatches it will be **Deerling**, **Skiddo**, **Girafarig**, or **Nincada**, randomly determined.

Head back down, defeat the grunts, then go down from here. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and the **PULSE Readou*t 5B*. 

Head back up, talk to Heather for a heal, then climb the nearby pillar, hop over to the main building, and head in. Jump on down. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and *Exp. Candy M*. Head up for a battle. 

Meteor Admin Taka (Super Potion). Field: Rocky Field
- Exeggcute, Lv. 22, Ability: Harvest, IVs: 10
    - Poison Powder
    - Leech Seed
    - Barrage
    - Bullet Seed
- Chatot, Lv. 25, @Wide Lens, Ability: Keen Eye, IVs: 5
    - Sing
    - Nasty Plot
    - Chatter
    - Taunt
- PULSE Tangrowth B, Lv. 24, @Oran Berry, Ability: Arena Trap, Impish Nature, IVs: 31. Stat Spread: 100/70/200/10/70/160. Typing: Grass/Ground
    - Leech Seed
    - Vine Whip
    - Sand Tomb
    - Rock Tomb

Taka will fight you on the Rocky Field. We don't have details on this field yet, but you will observe that Rock Tomb will be stronger here. The Telluric Seed can be helpful here: by testing it you'll notice that it raises Defense but does Stealth Rock damage. Since Exeggcute doesn't hit that hard you can take the chance to set up on it and then hit Tangrowth hard. This entire team is weak to Ice, so keep that in mind.

After the battle, you'll be sent outside. Answer Corey how you like here, then grab hidden *X Defend* and *Green Shard* as well as a *Big Root*.

Exit Malchous Forest Park in the top right corner. In the first house, you'll be able to defeat a Meteor Grunt to free Police Officer #1. In the building next door, head up to 5F via the elevator, and talk to the girl inside so she'll leave.

Head back to the main part of Jasper via the bottom right exit of Malchous. On your way back to the Pokemon Center area, you can now grab a hidden *Pokesnax*.

Past the Pokemon Center, enter the first building you see. Talk to the guy here to activate a quest. You can also enter the elevator room here to get the *Forest Field Readout*. 

Outside, you can now grab a *Paralyze Heal* and save Police Officer #2. Grab a hidden *Super Potion* and *Green Shard* outside and head into the small building here. If you have snax and talked to the panicking guy earlier, you can get **Mareep**!

Before we continue into the next ward, there's a quick thing we can do. Exit Jasper Ward to the south (there's a shortcut below the Mareep building) and head to the right. Enter the first house you see in Peridot Ward, and talk to the girls inside for *Department Store Sticker: Tangela* as well as *TM88 Sleep Talk*.

|*Light Clay*   |$200           |
|*Everstone*    |$200           |

Since money is still tight, I wouldn't recommend binging too many of these items for now, especially since most of them suck. We'll be able to get tons of the weather extending rocks, Iron Ball, and Light Clay after the next badge for free, but if your strategy involves weather or screens they are pretty cheap right now so it might be worth it for those.

Head outside and up to access the next ward.

## Rhodochrine Jungle & The Underroot

Enter the Beryl Ward. We can't really explore much of this ward itself right now. Head to the right to access the Beryl Bridge. Hidden on the bridge you'll find a *Heart Scale*, *X Speed*, and *Pokesnax*. 

While it is windy, at the end of the bridge you can catch **Drifloon**! Talk to the kid here and he will go home.

Back in Beryl, head left.

|Sewaddle          |11 |
|Oddish            |9  |

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and an *X Attack* in the house. Make your way left, grab the hidden *Poke Ball*, and enter the jungle.

|                  |   |**Tangela**       |5  |                  |   |

Throughout this guide, whenever we are guaranteed the ability to catch Pokemon that was previously randomly determined such as Pachirisu, I will bold it both times. Catch a Ledian for an in-game trade later.

Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy XS* here, then head up and get a hidden *Rawst Berry* and *Rare Candy*, being careful to avoid stepping on the suspicious patch of grass. Head down and to the left, you'll see Meteor Grunts. You'll actually have a choice now on how to proceed - you can either step on the suspicious patch of grass or step on tall grass near the grunts to end up in a trap, or carefully sneak around the grunts and head up. 

The jungle is huge, so I explain the results of this choice first, guide both routes to the same location, then explore the jungle after this convergence. 

### Choice: Trapped in a Cage

If you were trapped in a cage, read on, otherwise, jump to the next section.

You'll wake up in a cage and Fern will taunt you here.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Reject begging Fern (-1 Fern)
- Beg Fern once, then reject him (Neutral)
- Beg Fern twice, then reject him (+1 Fern)
- Beg Fern three times, then reject him (+2 Fern)
- Beg Fern four times (+5 Fern)

If you do reject him, eventually you will be let out anyways. 

Head up and to the right to free Cain from his cage.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Freed Cain from the cage (+1 Cain)

Head down from here and talk to the lever. Heather will show up and pull the switch to activate these bridges.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Got stuck in a cage (-1 Heather)

Head east from here, and go slightly south once you reach a Meteor Grunt. Continue south until you hit a Gentleman, then go straight east and follow the path up the hill via stairs. The house here is a healing house, should you need it.

### Choice: Snuck Around the Grunts

If you managed to carefully sneak around the grunts, read on, otherwise jump to the next section.

Head up and to the right and you'll find Fern. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talked to Fern atop the hill (+1 Fern)

The building to your right is a healing house, should you need it.

### Exploring the Jungle

Now, regardless of your choice you should be in the same place, so I can continue. Itemfind here for an *Exp. Candy S* then head down the hill, pick up hidden *Full Heal* and go down from here. The grunts around the file will be gone now, so you can pick up a hidden *Guard Spec* to the west. 

Head back up and go left. Here you'll see a gentleman, and in this area a hidden *Liechi Berry* and *Great Ball*. Up a hill in the top right part of this valley you can chop a wiggly tree.

Head back down the hill after the scene and go to the left. On this next hill you can obtain a hidden *X Speed*. To the northeast you'll find a hidden *Antidote*. Head back down.

We'll get to the cave entrance at the top later, for now, sneak around the building in the bottom left and pick up a hidden *Dark Gem*. You can actually enter the felled building to the right, inside you'll find *TM77 Psych Up*.

Back outside, head up the ramp to the left and pick up the hidden *Green Shard*. Cross the wooden bridge to the left and head up. Here you can find a hidden *Salac Berry*, *Paralyze Heal*, and an *Antidote* (that you can only get from the left, for some reason). Head back down the stairs but this time follow the narrow path up and to the right. You'll cross a bridge over land here, grab a hidden *Blue Shard* and carefully pick up the *PULSE Readout 5A* without stepping on the shifty 2-by-2 patch of land. After you grab the readout, step on the trap here. This brings us to the Underroot - but we will explore this area fully in a little bit. For now, grab the hidden *Exp. Candy S* in a rock to the right, jump down the ledge and take the stairs here to return to the familiar part of the jungle.

That's it for this branch of the jungle - for now, we're gonna head all the way back to the healing house from earlier. Go straight down from here and follow the path across the bridge. Grab a hidden *Blue Shard* as you make your way left. Head up as soon as you can, here is a Light Shard and a building. Inside, you'll find a PC as well as a in-game trade: your Sunkern for either **Carbink**, **Mime Jr.**, **Cryogonal**, or **Furfrou**, determined randomly. Perhaps more notably, it will be holding the *Exp. Share*!

Head outside and follow the path left. You'll find a hidden *Red Shard*. At the next fork, go up, where you'll find a hidden *Super Potion* and a *Telluric Seed*.

Take the other path of the fork now. You'll find a hidden *Calcium* here. Head to the left across the bridge and pick up an *Exp. Candy M*. Specifically on sunny days, you can battle and catch **Tropius** here as well. It's very strong for this point in the game, so be careful.

Head back across the bridge, and from here go down to find a hidden *Purple Shard* and a *Great Ball*. That pretty much covers the part of the jungle we have been able to access for now, so it's time to explore the Underroot. Nearby you'll see a trap spot on the ground, step on it to fall in.

### Exploring the Underroot

Hidden here is an *Exp. Candy S*. We can't do anything with these glowy rocks for a while, so head out of this area.

The Underroot

|Land              |%  |Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|**Zigzagoon**     |20 |**Barboach**      |70 |
|**Morelull**      |20 |**Chinchou**      |30 |
|Noibat            |10 |
|**Psyduck**       |10 |
|**Kecleon**       |10 |
|**Spinda**        |10 |
|Woobat            |5  |
|**Shuppet**       |5  |
|**Phantump**      |5  |
|**Bunnelby**      |5  |

Head to the right first. You'll find a hidden *Chesto Berry* here. Take the nearby stairs to reach a new area of the jungle. You can find a hidden *Red Shard* and *Exp. Candy S* here. You can also battle and catch **Taillow** at the top.

Back in the Underroot, take the path up from here and cut the wiggly tree. Take the nearby stairs to access another section of jungle. Go up here to find a hidden *Ether* and **Stantler**. 

Follow the path all the way down and to the right. Inside a house here is a lady. She will tutor us a pretty good move... but only if you have a Grass-type starter. Since Grass type starters kinda suck compared to Fire-type and Water-type starters, here's a bit of compensation.

Rhodochrine Jungle Move Tutor (If you chose a Grass-type Starter)

|Move       |Price|
|-----------|-----|
|Giga Drain |Free |

Before we leave this section of jungle, there is a broken building with some lights on to the left. Enter this building and defeat a Team Meteor Grunt to free Police Officer #3.

Back in the Underroot go up and grab a hidden *Purple Shard*. To the left you'll find a hidden *Exp. Candy S* and a stationary **Seviper**.

Up and to the right you can get a hidden *Energy Root* and *Red Shard*, and free Police Officer #4. Head down and pass under the waterfall to the right. Head right for a hidden *Dire Hit* and *Poke Ball*. Back left from here, head up. This was an area we visited earlier - you can access the main part of the jungle via these stairs.

Head down from here and take the stairs downward. Hug the left wall as you go down. You'll find a *Potion*, *Blue Shard*, *Energy Powder*, *Heavy Ball*, and an *Elemental Seed* on the ground. Use the Light Shard if you need it and head back up.

At the first fork, now go to the right. Grab a hidden *Oran Berry* and a *Hyper Potion* on the ground. Back up from here, take a right at the next fork 
Go to the right when you can, get a hidden *Ice Heal*, and emerge into the jungle once more.

### Finishing Up in the Jungle

Head out and to the right, and you'll actually pop out in Beryl Ward. There is a hidden *Super Potion* and a *PP Up* here. Head into this library.

You can walk on the tops of bookshelves in here, do so to get *TM20 Safeguard* as well as the *Corrosive Field Readout*. Enter the door on the right. Inside you'll find an *Ill-Fated Doll* and by talking to Growlithe and then the crevasse you find will find out what happened to Police Officer #5. Reading on the job: never again.

Enter the left room of the library if you'd like. Inside you'll meet a man.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Radomus in the library (+1 Radomus)

Back outside, chop the tree to your left and enter the felled building. Beat the grunt and re-enter the jungle to the left. Grab a hidden *Exp. Candy S* and *Burn Heal*. You can talk to Amaria here, the second time she'll heal your party even.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Amaria in the jungle (+1 Amaria)

Cut down the wiggly tree nearby, then head back through the path through Beryl by the library, the jungle, and the underroot to return to the healing house in the eastern side of the jungle. It's time to finish up in this area, so prepare your team as necessary. 

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to save all five officers by this point.**

Meteor Manager Ace of Clubs (Super Potion). Field: Forest Field
- Zorua, Lv. 25, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Illusion, Serious Nature, IVs: 20

    - Growth
    - Mega Drain
    - Stored Power
    - Rock Tomb

Finally we get to battle Meteor's Ace themselves. I wish there was a way to not spoil the surprise of their first Pokemon in this guide, but that Pokemon and many more on their team have Grass moves that feed off of the terrain's 1.5x boost. Braixen can steal your items and hit pretty hard with Psybeam and Fire Spin, and Roselia as we've seen with Fern is a hard hitting and healing monster in the early game. With the PULSE in the back, this can be a tough fight, especially if you're not careful and let it use double-power Growth and/or let it collect Stamina boosts, since then it bowls you over with Stored Power and Mega Drain.

One thing to consider is that past Braixen a Bug-type can do pretty well here against their team, especially a special attacker or one with Swarm. Cut will also hit for double damage on Roselia and Tangrowth if you so choose. If you're holding a Telluric Seed still, it gives you a free Spiky Shield on its holder's first turn, so in a pinch you can abuse that to set up one of your own Pokemon so that Tangrowth goes down before it can boost too much. Or, you can simply use Slugma or Numel to light the field up and watch their time minus Braixen and Baltoy burn passively each turn.

Once you win, you can find a *Super Repel* in the next area. Head down. Here, you'll see a scene involving Corey.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Find all five officers before fighting Ace (+1 Heather, +1 Anna, +1 Shade)

## Beryl Ward & Beryl Cemetery

With that out of the way, we now can actually explore the main part of Beryl Ward. 

Before we do anything else, talk to the backpacker nearby a dumpster down from the Pokemart. If you give him $5000 he will give you the *Magnetic Lure*, an amazing item that, when equipped by your party leader, guarantees you will encounter a Pokemon you haven't caught yet in an area. No more do you have to aimlessly wander around an area looking for that 4% encounter!

Nearby, on clear days, you'll find another snax vendor. 

Beryl Ward Snax Shop

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|*Pokesnax* |$650       |

Enter the building up and to the left from this guy. On a sunny day, go onto the rooftop to be able to obtain **Helioptile** in exchange for some snax.

Inside the Pokemon center, an NPC will tell you a password: *easyhms*. This one was in the readme, but you can input it with a Data Chip if you didn't input it yet and Cut has been too annoying so far.

Around the town, you can find 2 hidden *Blue Shards*, *Escape Rope*, *Fighting Gem*, *Potion*, *Red Shard*, and *HP Up*. Continuing to the left into the cemetery area, you can find hidden *Elemental Seed* and *Poke Ball*.

Next, we're gonna head back through the jungle to get to the library. In the left room you can find a *TwistedSpoon*. Could be useful soon.

Back in the jungle, explore around the area where we fought Ace. You'll find a hidden *Petaya Berry*, *Red Shard* as well as a *Great Ball*.

That about wraps up everything we can do for now, so head into the abandoned gym at the top of the hill in Beryl.

## VS. Agent Borealis

Head into the gym.

### Choice: Didn't Save Police Officers in Time

If you didn't make this choice, skip ahead to the next subsection.

If you want to access Corey's bedroom, you can turn all the pillars red.

Head up and into the battle room.

Agent Corey (2x Super Potion). Field: Corrosive Field
- Skrelp, Lv. 26, @Focus Sash, Ability: Adaptability, Modest Nature, IVs: 10
    - Acid
    - Toxic Spikes
    - Water Pulse
    - Venom Drench

    - Venom Drench
    - Venoshock
    - Air Cutter
    - Roost
  
As you can probably tell from the Corrosive Field notes, you'll be worn down by Poison-type entry damage. Grass types have a really rough time here, and many special Ground moves otherwise super-effective against his team are cancelled out by a Poison type modifier. Thankfully half of his team isn't too dreadful: Skrelp and Nidorina don't hit too hard, and Croagunk isn't too bad if you're able to knock it out before it can ruin you with Sucker Punch. Mareanie hits hard with Merciless and Venoshock both always on, but since you outspeed it you may be able to strike at it first. However Skuntank can hit decently hard by stacking Acid Sprays, and with its bulk it can be a threat. Crobat however is a menace right now, since it basically outspeeds every Pokemon you can have by this point and hits like a truck on this field with activated Venoshock.

The key here is putting yourself in a position to be able to deal with Crobat. It's frail enough to die to one or two well placed super-effective hits, so by either raising your speed or sending in something with some bulk, you may find success. Of course, your own Poison types and Steel types are immune to a lot of the field's shenanigans, hence are good options. Psychic types too are good as long as you can play around Sucker Punch. As long as you aren't going with Mud Shot and Mud Bomb, Ground types can be good at knocking out the fodder to open up Crobat for the rest of your team. You can also try to use the field to your advantage to some extent: Sleep Powder becomes 100% accurate here, and the Telluric Seed gives any Pokemon a free turn of protect. Unfortunately unless you're using your own Poison-type strategies there isn't really much else you can do to exploit this field yourself, so bring a strong team and you can prevail. Worst case scenario you can grind your team up to Level 35 since the cap is so high right now.

### Choice: Saved Police Officers

If you didn't make this choice, skip ahead to the next section.

Talk to the chief to get the *Corrosive Mist Field Readout*. Defeat the officers milling about.

Turn all of the pillars blue. Each one will also change its neighbors, so keep that in mind while you solve this puzzle.

Talk to the agent in his room, then head up into the arena once you're ready.

Agent Borealis (Super Potion). Field: Corrosive Mist Field atop Corrosive Field
- Skrelp, Lv. 26, @Focus Sash, Ability: Adaptability, Modest Nature, IVs: 5
    - Acid
    - Bubble
    - Smokescreen
    - Venom Drench
- Mareanie, Lv. 26, Ability: Merciless, Sassy Nature, IVs: 5
    - Peck
    - Bite
    - Venoshock
    - Protect

    - Double Kick

    - Bite

    - Sucker Punch
    - Drain Punch
    - Venoshock
    - Mud Bomb
- Skuntank, Lv. 27, Ability: Aftermath, Careful Nature
    - Pursuit
    - Flamethrower

- Crobat, Lv. 30, Ability: Infiltrator, Timid Nature, IVs: 6
    - Venom Drench
    - Venoshock
    - Air Cutter
    - Nasty Plot

As you can probably tell from the Corrosive Mist Field notes, your non Poison and Steel-types will be Poisoned by the field. Your special flying moves and bubble-based attacks will be nerfed against him as well. Thankfully half of his team isn't too dreadful: Skrelp and Nidorina don't hit too hard, and Croagunk isn't too bad if you're able to knock it out before it can ruin you with Sucker Punch. Mareanie hits hard with Merciless and Venoshock exploiting your team being poisoned, but since you outspeed it you may be able to strike at it first. However Skuntank can hit decently hard by stacking Acid Sprays and hitting with boosted Flamethrower, and with its bulk it can be a threat. Crobat however is a menace right now, since it basically outspeeds every Pokemon you can have by this point and hits like a truck on this field with activated Venoshock, and if you let it boost it's basically over most of the time.

On this field, you really have to find a way to very quickly take out the team without suffering too many casualties yourself and find a way to deal with Crobat, since it likes to revenge kill your Pokemon that have already taken tons of Poison damage and sweep. However, it's frail enough to die to one or two well placed super-effective hits, so keeping a sturdy Rock, Electric, Ice, or Psychic type in the back holding the Atk/SpA boosting Elemental Seed may lead you to success. Of course, your own Poison types and Steel types are immune to a lot of the field's shenanigans, hence are good options. Psychic types too are good as long as you can play around Sucker Punch. I recommend using Fire moves too since they're boosted by the field - only Skrelp and Mareanie resist them and they can hit hard in the right circumstances. A unique thing you can do is exploit the fact that Incinerate, Flame Burst, and Self-Destruct will knock out both active Pokemon and switch you to Corrosive Field (suggestions for that, if needed, are in the previous subsection), so if you are having trouble with Crobat or Skuntank you can send in a full health Slugma, Numel and try to do a kill from the grave. Worst case scenario you can grind your team up to Level 35 since the cap is so high right now.

# Aftershocks

To continue the story, head to Beryl Bridge and watch the scene. After you see an explosion with Fern, our next destination will be the North Obsidia Ward, but there are some very worthwhile quests we can do in the meantime.

## The Mystery Egg and Other Quests

First, after the events at the bridge, enter Corey's gym and enter his bedroom area. Here you'll find the *Silver Ring*, which will help us get some familiar Pokemon! Speaking of which, make your way to the Underroot and head to the bottom right section, then go left and up to reach the large pool in the center. You'll find a **Skrelp** here who will see the Silver Ring and join your team.

Next, head to the Beryl Library. Talk to the Gothitelle here, then pick up trash and stray books all around the library by spamming the action button. Once you finish, talk to Gothitelle for a *Soul Candle*. You can also talk to one of the **Gothita** to obtain it.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Clean up the Library (+1 Adrienn)
  
Head on over to the Beryl Cemetery at night. Talk to one of the pumpkins with a Soul Candle in your bag and you can catch **Pumpkaboo**.

Head down into Jasper Ward and go left. You'll see a kid being bullied by some Venipede and Scolipede. Defeat them, and the kid will head back to his home.

Next, it's time for the big one. Head back to the Jasper Police Station and talk to the chief, then talk to the female **Growlithe**. That alone is a decent reward, but we can take this Growlithe and any male Pokemon in its egg group to the daycare to produce an egg. Bring an egg back to the police station and we can trade it with the guy at the bottom to get what the community calls the Mystery Egg.

The Mystery Egg can actually hatch to be one of 18 different Pokemon - all of which are pretty solid team members in an early-game scenario where a lot of the available Pokemon suck. You'll get one of the following, randomly determined:

- **Azurill**
- **Mareanie**
- **Staryu**
- **Togepi**
- **Sneasel**
- **Shroomish**
- **Gastly**
- **Axew**
- **Vulpix (Alolan)**
- **Pawniard**
- **Litwick**
- **Trapinch**
- **Cottonee**
- **Vulpix**
- **Elekid**
- **Starly**
- **Rockruff**
- **Larvesta**

Of course, we can get the other 17 at a later time.

## North Obsidia Ward

With that taken care of, we're going back to Opal Ward to head up at the bridge. You'll enter North Obsidia Ward. Defeat some trainers and you'll be able to explore the ward. You'll find hidden *Zinc*, *X Sp. Def*, *Super Potion*, *Ether*, *Common Candy*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Ability Capsule*, *Chewing Gum*, and *Great Ball*.

Finding this last item will put us in front of the nightclub: from 8PM to 4AM you can enter. You can get one of the best TM's in the game here: *TM17 Protect*!

Outside, the building to your right contains a *Telluric Seed*. There's an alleyway outside containing some gang members nearby. 

North Obsidia Alleyway

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Stunky            |25 |
|Trubbish          |20 |

|Yungoos           |20 |
|**Espurr**        |13 |
|**Mightyena**     |2  |

Don't talk to the guys here quite yet though - we'll be making a choice in a bit involving these guys.

Next, enter the Spyce restaurant below and to the right. A guy inside will give you a *Full Incense*. In a nearby trash can you can find *TM56 Fling*. 

The Spyce Drink Shop

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Fresh Water*  |$200   |
|*Soda Pop*     |$300   |
|*Lemonade*     |$350   |

Back in the main part of the ward, talk to the people here and in the nearby buildings if you'd like.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Fern in North Obsidia Ward (+1 Fern)

## Lapis Ward

Head up the stairs to your left to enter the final ward of the city we've yet to explore!

Talk to the girl with the colorful hair in front of the very tall building, then make your way to the very top of the area to talk to the purple haired girl and the guy with red hair. After this conversation we'll be free to explore the area.

Hidden around the ward you can find *Great Ball*, *Blue Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, *Salt Water Taffy*, *Poke Ball*, *X Defend*, and *Exp. Candy M*.

You can enter the Alleyway towards the middle of the ward, but we won't talk to the guys in here quite yet. 

Lapis Alleyway

|Cave                  |%  |
|----------------------|---|
|Stunky                |25 |

|**Meowth (Alolan)**   |20 |
|Espurr                |13 |
|**Raticate (Alolan)** |1  |
|**Persian (Alolan)**  |1  |

Enter the building in the middle of the top row of buildings, just to the left of the gym. The guy inside will teach your starter the pledge moves for some shards.

|Move           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|Grass Pledge   |3 Green Shards |
|Fire Pledge    |3 Red Shards   |
|Water Pledge   |3 Blue Shards  |

Enter the flower shop on the left side of the ward. Someone inside will give you the *Wailmer Pail*. In the top left corner, you can complete a puzzle to get **Spritzee**! The completed puzzle looks like this:

<img src="/assets/media/reborn/spritzee.jpg"/>

Sweet Scent Flower Shop Top

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Honey*        |$1000          |
|*Oran Berry*   |$200           |
|*Rose Incense* |$9600          |
|*Floral Charm* |$1500          |
|*Sachet*       |$1000          |
|*Pokesnax*     |$400           |

We will eventually need a Floral Charm and around 25-30 Honeys for sidequests later. There is technically a cheaper option to get the honey later on, however. 

Sweet Scent Flower Shop Bottom

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Red Nectar*   |$3000          |
|*Yellow Nectar*|$3000          |
|*Pink Nectar*  |$3000          |
|*Purple Nectar*|$3000          |

If you're planning on switching around your Oricorio a lot, this is the shop for you.

Enter a small house on the left side of the ward and talk to a guy to get *TM21 Frustration*. In the Pokemart to your right, talk to a guy with a hood to get *TM07 Hail*. Next, enter the building to the right. For saving the kid from Scolipede, the mom here will give you the *Department Store Sticker: Drifloon*. 

Department Store 4F Left Shop

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Air Balloon*  |$400           |
|*White Herb*   |$1000          |
|*Mental Herb*  |$1000          |
|*Power Herb*   |$1000          |
|*Absorb Bulb*  |$1200          |
|*Snowball*     |$1000          |

Some consumables that may be useful in a pinch.

Department Store 4F Right Shop

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Smoke Ball*   |$2150          |
|*Destiny Knot* |$8000          |
|*Power Weight* |$15000         |
|*Power Bracer* |$15000         |
|*Power Belt*   |$15000         |
|*Power Anklet* |$15000         |
|*Power Lens*   |$15000         |
|*Power Band*   |$15000         |
|*TM48 Round*   |$9000          |

Finally some good things for sale in this building. The Power Items raise 32 EV's per defeated Pokemon and cancel out other EV's. Meaning if you catch a new Pokemon you simply have to defeat any 8 Pokemon with a Power Item to max out - or 17 total for a usual 252/252/4 spread. This is so incredibly fast that there is virtually no reason not to EV train in this game given how tough the fights can be. Of course, these are probably a bit too pricey for us right now, but keep in mind that they're here so when we have the cash we can immediately max out our EV's. If you're planning on breeding you can get a Destiny Knot.

Anyways, that's all we can do in Lapis for now, so head back down to the North Obsidia Ward.

## The Grand Stairway

Talk to Cain here, and he will distract an officer so you can slip by. 

Relationship Point Choices: 
- Talk to the guard 4 times while Cain is distracting him (-1 Cain)

You can find a hidden *Rock Gem* on the stairs. Head on down the ladder. You can find a *Green Shard* hidden in this first area. Head down the stairs again.

|**Geodude**       |10 |
|**Chingling**     |8  |
|**Dunsparce**     |1  |

We will eventually need both a Chimecho and a Dunsparce for some sidequests, so get them here.

On this floor you'll find a hidden *Ghost Gem*. Head down the ladder. 

Grand Stairway B2F

|Cave              |%  |

|Chingling         |10 |
|**Unown**         |5  |
|Dunsparce         |5  |

Pick up a hidden *Red Shard* and a *Dire Hit* to the right. Below here, you'll notice that there are some ledges we can hop down. If you hop down exactly four times, you can find a hidden *Focus Sash* here. Consider saving this for a situation that you really need it.

Down from here there are essentially four paths we can take down the ledges. I start by heading down the rightmost path first. Pick up a hidden *Guard Spec* then take the ladder. In the next room you can grab a hidden *Star Piece* then head into the small cave here. "The Crystals glimmer with fissures" is a clue related to field effects - see if you can figure it out. 

> The solution: use Magnitude or Bulldoze here on the field. Many of the wild Pokemon have one of these moves.

Once you do so, you can grab the *Crystal Cavern Field Readout*. Head back out then go up the ladder at the top. You can find a hidden *Heart Scale* as well as a *Magical Seed* and a *Exp. Candy M*. Can't do anything else here so head up the next ladder. In here you can pick up an *Ability Capsule* and hidden *Exp. Candy M* and *Red Hots*. 

You'll notice that we're back on B1F, so head back down the ladder below. This time we are going to take the ledges down to go all the way to the left. You'll reach a ladder. Upstairs, you can find a hidden *Ground Gem* and *Super Repel*. Head down the ledge - again we'll be on B1F.

Head down to the sequence of ledges again. This time we will take the second-path from the left. Use your itemfinder as you're going down and you can obtain a *Green Shard*. Head to the left and go straight up. A guy will give you 3 *Exp. Candy M*. Nearby is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Go down the first set of stairs from here then immediately sneak past some rocks to the left. You'll obtain *TM69 Rock Polish*! Head back down the stairs and climb the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Psychic Gem*, *X Speed*, and *Pokesnax* along the way.

Finally, we can take the huge series of ledges to take the third path from the left. Grab the hidden *X Sp. Atk* then head down the ladder here.

Talk to the guy in the center here, then head to the left and talk to the two here for a battle.

Their four rock types have their attacks boosted on the field. They're all pretty fast, especially Midday Lycanroc, so you have to have a bit of bulk to live. With the help of Victoria's fighting type moves though you will probably be able to find a way through this with a team of six.

You can accept Victoria's fast travel request afterwards.

Back in North Obsidia Ward, Victoria will request that you battle her.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Say No to Victoria's battle request (-1 Victoria)

Since last time, Victoria has evolved some of her team, but she shouldn't be too much of a threat if you've been able to defeat all the gym leaders to this point. She has a bit of diversity on her team: Kirlia and Pikachu can hit moderately hard with their STAB Special moves. Torracat will dampen a physical sweeper if you have one. Ultimately you can probably find a way to set up on Pancham or just overwhelm her in a 6v4.

This is technically part of another gauntlet: time for another battle right after, though you do get healed.

    - Sleep Powder
    - Giga Drain
    - Extrasensory
    - Hidden Power

Since last time, Fern has evolved his Roselia into Roserade, picked up a Rhyhorn, and evolved his Sandile. You don't want to let Krokorok sweep you, but it thankfully isn't too strong until it gets it's first boost, so a good switch can help against it. The big threat here is 31IV Roserade - it's really fast and likes to pickup one-shots with Giga Drain and heal off whatever damage you've managed to get on it. Thankfully Rhyhorn isn't really a threat to most Pokemon, so the key to this fight is figuring out how to put yourself in a position to knock out Roserade before it comes out. 

After winning, you'll be given *TMX7 Rock Smash*. We can't use it in the field yet, however.

Head to the nightclub up and to the right. You'll see a guy outside who you can talk to.

I often find that it is raining when I start this fight, hence Drought Torkoal may cause it to be a Rainbow Field battle for eight turns. This makes Nature Power turn into boosted Aurora Beam, interestingly giving Ice-type coverage to a Fire-type Sun team. Anyways, his team is fairly strong for this point under sun, so you're gonna have to be careful of letting his Houndoom and Magmortar destroy you with powered-up Fire moves. The Rainbow field will also increase chances to burn, so your physical attackers may become crippled. One strategy you can use is changing the weather to something else, Rain will dampen his attacks and the other two will cancel the Rainbow Field. If you can knock out Torkoal he has no way to set up Sun, so you can use the Protect and Substitute TMs we now have to stall out the sun if you need to. Weaken his weather and field advantage and you can win.

Head into the gym and go upstairs. Talk to the group here, then head outside and attempt to enter the orphanage in the center of town. A girl will leave. Head in. Inside, you'll have to defeat an Orderly.

After you leave, head back to the gym and go upstairs. We have our next mission: challenging Shelly for a badge. We can talk to Victoria here as well.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Victoria after Shelly tells you to have a battle with her (+1 Cal)

Before we do though we can start a sidequest.

## Joining a Gang

We actually have to join a gang to progress the story. Technically we can do this later, but there are some nice rewards we can get right now, so we might as well start now. You actually get to choose which gang to join: the Magma Gang in the North Obsidia Alleyway, or the Aqua Gang in the Lapis Alleyway. Head over to your choice of alleyway.

### Choice: The Magma Gang

Skip to the next section if you chose the Aqua Gang.
 
Talk to the guys guarding the North Obsidia alleyway for a battle.

Once you make it in, you'll find *TM46 Thief* as well as a hidden *Red-Hots*. Talk to Maxwell in the back. 

Make your way to the shack to the right of the flower shop in Lapis Ward. Talk to Maxwell here. Then make your way to Ms. Craudberry's house down from the Pokemon Center. Head into the backroom.

Inside, defeat the Aqua associates here. You'll find a *Fire Stone* as well as **Buizel**. Head back to your alleyway after grabbing it and talk to Maxwell here. 

We can now continue our ongoing stolen Pokemon quest as well. Just south of the North Obsidia alleyway you can find a Magma Gang member. He will tell you he already lost the Pokemon to an Aqua Gang member, but will give you a *Metronome*. 

Head over to the Lapis Ward. To the west of the gym you'll find the Aqua Gang member. Defeat him... only to learn he already sold the Pokemon to someone in 7th Street. That's all we can do for now.

### Choice: The Aqua Gang

Skip to the next section if you chose the Magma Gang.

Talk to the guys guarding the Lapis alleyway for a battle.

Once you make it in, you'll find *TM41 Torment*. Talk to Archer in the back.

Make your way to the shack to the right of the flower shop in Lapis Ward. Talk to Archer here.

Just for completeness, Archer won't be blocking the pond in the alleyway anymore so we can fish here now.

Lapis Alleyway

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Barboach          |100|

Anyways, make your way to Ms. Craudberry's house down from the Lapis Pokemon Center. Head into the backroom.

Inside, defeat the Magma associates here. You'll find a *Water Stone* as well as **Ponyta**. Head back to your alleyway after grabbing it and talk to Archer here. 

We can now continue our ongoing stolen Pokemon quest as well. Just south of the North Obsidia alleyway you can find a Magma Gang member. Defeat him, and he will tell you an Aqua Gang member has the Pokemon already.

Head over to the Lapis Ward. To the west of the gym you'll find the Aqua Gang member. You'll learn that he already sold the Pokemon to someone in 7th Street, but he'll give you a *Metronome*. That's all we can do for now.

### Getting the Bicycle and Zorua

Regardless of your gang choice, head over to Madame Craudberry's house once more. Inside, she'll try to get you arrested, but if you have saved all the police officers they'll trust that you are not a gang member. Hehehe.

Head outside and try to leave, and the cop will even give you a *Bike Voucher*!

Enter the building below and trade it away to get the *Bicycle*! Heck yes.

Now that we have our fancy bicycle, we can very quickly get all the way to Beryl Ward... so let's do that. Go onto the rooftop of the building where we once captured Helioptile on a clear night, and you'll see... Corey? Make your way to Peridot Ward next, where you'll encounter him near the Pokemart. Finally, head to North Obsidia Ward and enter the building to the left of the alleyway. Inside you'll find him once more... and be able to catch **Zorua**!

## Cocoon Badge

Now it's time to go for our badge. Head into Shelly's gym and go to the right. There is a front area, a back area, and upstairs - your goal is to turn every single monitor that is in the area on and still successfully get to the upstairs area and cross the bookshelves. You can only cross from the front to the back area if one of the red, blue, and yellow stacks is exactly 1 unit tall. 

Using this information, it can be fun to try to solve this puzzle yourself. The game actually has a cheeky secret way to solve it though:

> Simply check monitors for a light above or below it. If it is yellow, ignore it, if it is green, click that one next.

Whichever way you solve the puzzle, click the final monitor that you can find upstairs, then cross the bookshelves. You can find a *Leaf Stone* nearby.

Head up, and save before you fight Shelly.

    - Rain Dance

- Volbeat, Lv. 35, @Leftovers, Ability: Prankster, Bold Nature, IVs: 31
    - Tail Glow
    - Moonlight
    - Struggle Bug
    - Dazzling Gleam

I think this fight is wonderful because it sweeps the feet out from under new players that think Bug is a terrible type. The Forest Field, as we've seen, powers up Struggle Bug. It also gives Anorith a free Spiky Shield due to its seed. More notable however is the rain that's present here - it prevents you from burning the forest down, activates Anorith's Swift Swim, weakens your Fire-types, and powers the various Water moves she uses. Plus it's the first gym that fights in doubles and the combination of Intimidate and Struggle Bug can make your attacks weak - all this combines to making a difficult fight that your team might not immediately be prepared for. 

To win, you'll have to come up with a solid strategy, luckily at this point in the game you do have some options. Castform's Sunny Day or mystery egg Vulpix's Drought will make it sunny, which turns the field to Rainbow Field. You can then exploit the Rainbow Field by using Nature Power into boosted Aurora Beam and/or 140 flat damage Sonicboom to win. You can also switch up the weather to Hail or Sandstorm, just be careful since her Illumise and Araquanid can switch it back. If you do so you can use specific Fire-type moves to turn the field to Burning which... completely ruins her team. Another generally solid strategy is just abusing the field with your own Bug types - Joltik, Vespiquen, and all of the early-evolving stage 3 bugs can to some extent really shine here. You can use Telluric Seeds if you have them as well. You can also bring your own Swift Swim team to abuse the rain and outspeed her team. Also, Rock Slide. Tons of options here if you think ahead about what your strategy will be.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Shelly on your first try (+1 Victoria)
- Defeat Shelly on a second, third, etc. try (-1 Victoria)

After you succeed, you will get the *Cocoon Badge* as well as *TM76 Struggle Bug* and also get to use Lv. 40 Pokemon and use Rock Smash in the field.

# Escape! from Reborn City

Head outside the gym after watching the scene in Shelly's room. After you head outside, you have another rival battle.

Pretty Boy Cain (2x Super Potion). Field: No Field 
- Brionne, Lv. 32, @Zoom Lens, Ability: Torrent, Modest Nature, IVs: 15
    - Icy Wind
    - Disarming Voice

- Nidoking, Lv. 36, Ability: Sheer Force, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thrash
    - Double Kick
    - Poison Tail
    - Chip Away

This battle probably won't be too tough if you could defeat Shelly. Nidoking hits hard, but it still has fairly weak STAB attacks. Defeat him with your best strategies. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Agree to save Heather (+1 Cain)
- Refuse to help Heather (-1 Cain)

With that, Cain and Shelly will head over to the Orphanage. 

## Lapis Ward Orphanage

Head into the Orphanage as soon as the door opens. You'll be paired up with either Cain or Shelly depending on who you have more relationship points with at this moment.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat the Orderlies with Cain (+1 Cain)
- Defeat the Orderlies with Shelly (+1 Shelly)

After this fight, you'll be free to explore. Keep in mind though:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Leave the Orphanage while partnered (-1 Cain, -1 Shelly, -1 Charlotte, -1 Noel, -1 Heather)

But you can also gain points:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Shelly while partnered (+1 Shelly)

We can now choose where to go.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Enter the hallway first before exploring upstairs (-1 Shelly)

So, we're gonna head upstairs first. Defeat orderlies as you go up. You'll eventually get locked out from continuing, so head downstairs and talk to Anna again.

Enter the open door on the first floor. Be careful about trying to enter the doors on the left.

Relationship Point Choices:
- The Player is male and tries to enter the Girls' Bathroom two times (-1 Shelly)

Beat the orderlies in the room above. You can read the green books for some background on the new characters. Back outside, head down and to the left. Defeat more orderlies and pick up a *Data Chip*. Talk to the green computer screen nearby to open a lock. 

Head back upstairs and go through the now-opened path.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Ignore Noel in the cage (-1 Noel)
  
Defeat the orderlies upstairs then open the patient cages. You can find a hidden *Great Ball* here. Grab the *Paralyze Heal* on your way down.

On the first floor enter the room on the right.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Charlotte twice while she's in a cage (-2 Charlotte)

Unlock Charlotte's cage. If you unlock the cage on the right the kid inside will give you 4 *Exp. Candy M*. Defeat some orderlies, then at the bottom grab the *Odd Incense* and the *Archive Key*. 

Back in the left hallway, use the *Archive Key* to grab an *Exp. Candy L* and read some more books about the orphanage's characters. With that, head all the way up to the top of the orphanage to bust out.

Dr. Sigmund Connal. Field: No Field

- Raichu (Raichu-Alola), Lv. 36, Ability: Surge Surfer, Modest Nature, IVs: 15
    - Volt Switch
    - Psychic
    - Nuzzle
    - Fake Out

You'll notice that the doctor has a strong team full of Electric and Psychic types. Electivire will often pivot to Musharna, who will use Psychic Terrain, guaranteeing it, Hypno, and Raichu huge bonuses. You can try to use your own Psychic attacks on the terrain against the electric types if you'd like, you can also stall out the Terrain if it is too much to handle. This can be a tough fight but you can find a way through!

Outside, accept Anna's request for fast travel. We'll find ourselves back in the Underground Railnet. Head to the east and smash the rock to progress. 

Underground Railnet Middle Area

|Cave              |%  |

|Noibat            |30 |

|**Mawile**        |10 |
|**Skorupi**       |9  |
|**Klang**         |1  |

You can also find a hidden *Pecha Berry*, *Carbos*, *Purple Shard*, *Red Shard*, and *Fire Gem* here. In the bottom right corner you can get the *Dull Key*. Open the gate on the right for a shortcut, then talk to the group at the top. Sounds like we're going to be taking on another gym leader soon, but before that there are tons of areas we can now access thanks to Rock Smash. Oh, and we get to strike at the heart of our enemy gang.

## Defeating the Rival Gang

It's time to help out our friendly gang once more.

### Choice: The Magma Gang 2

If you joined Aqua last chapter, skip ahead to the next section.

Return to Maxwell in North Obsidia, then head over to the Aqua Gang's hideout in Lapis. Defeat the guards at the entrance. Grab *TM41 Torment* while you're here and prepare for a battle.

Aqua Mastermind Archer (2x Berry Ice Cream). Field: No Field
- Pelipper, Lv. 41, Ability: Drizzle, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Roost
    - Tailwind
    - Brine
    - Ice Beam
- Blastoise, Lv. 42, Ability: Torrent, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Aqua Tail
    - Bite
    - Skull Bash
    - Yawn
- Sharpedo, Lv. 45, Ability: Speed Boost, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Aqua Jet
    - Crunch
    - Slash
    - Ice Fang

This can be a tough fight since his levels are above your cap and he has Drizzle on his side. That said with no Damp Rock Pelipper is the only rain setter, and only for 5 turns, so you can pretty easily use Protect to make it go away and then go to town. His Sharpedo will outspeed you but doesn't hit incredibly hard, while his Blastoise can be tanky but shouldn't be too threatening outside of the rain.

Once you win, the Aqua Gang will retreat. We can actually now access the pond in the back, nothing new though.

Lapis Alleyway

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Barboach          |100|

Anyways, return to Maxwell at your alleyway to get **Houndour**. That's it with the Magma Gang for another few badges, however.

### Choice: The Aqua Gang 2

If you joined Magma last chapter, skip ahead to the next section.

Return to Archer in Lapis, then head over to the Magma Gang's hideout in North Obsidia. Defeat the guards at the entrance. Grab *TM46 Thief* as well as a hidden *Red-Hots* while you're here and prepare for a battle.

Magma Kingpin Maxwell (2x Berry Ice Cream). Field: No Field
- Ninetales, Lv. 41, Ability: Drought, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Will-O-Wisp
    - Payback
    - Flamethrower
    - Confuse Ray
- Charizard, Lv. 42, Ability: Solar Power, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Dragon Rage
    - Hidden Power
    - Flame Burst
    - Ancient Power
- Houndoom, Lv. 45, Ability: Flash Fire, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Fire Fang
    - Feint Attack
    - Thunder Fang
    - Return

This can be a tough fight since his levels are above your cap and he has Drought on his side. That said with no Heat Rock Ninetales is the only sun setter, and only for 5 turns, so you can pretty easily use Protect to make it go away and then go to town. His Houndoom is physical so doesn't hit very hard, while his Charizard is really only super threatening under the sun, so you can surely find a way through.

Once you win, the Magma Gang will retreat. Behind where Maxwell was you can get a hidden *X Attack*. 

Anyways, return to Archer at your alleyway to get **Carvanha**. That's it with the Aqua Gang for another few badges, however.

## Rock Smash Exploration

The first place we can go that has new stuff is the Onyx Ward. Inside one of the rooms upstairs the guy playing "Mr. Mimecraft" will now move. Using the Data Chip we found earlier, we can talk to the PC here for a chance to catch **Porygon**. Next, head to the hallway where the move tutors are. Go into the left door - inside you can talk to someone who will tell us a new password: *stopitems*. 

In Lapis Ward a lady in the Pokemon Center will tell us about a few more passwords: *leveloffset* and *percentlevel*. 

Make your way to the North Obsidia Ward. Here you'll see a guy selling a single *Link Stone* for $10000. What this does is essentially work as an evolution stone for trade items. It's pricey, but if you have a Pokemon like Graveler you're trying to evolve it's worth picking up.

### A Trip to the Stairway

Head over to the Grand Stairway and make your way to B1F. At the top right, smash a rock, pick up a hidden *Green Shard*, then go up. In this new room you can find a hidden *PP Up*, *Exp. Candy L*, and a stationary *Exp. Candy M*. Talk to the hiker in here for a *Mining Kit*. 

The Mining Kit allows us to finally deal with all those glowing rocks everywhere. Essentially we get to play the Gen 4 mining minigame except the prizes are actually good. Each stone will generate 2-4 items, picked via the following probabilities:

|Item             |%     |
|-----------------|------|
|*Helix Fossil*   |1.17% |
|*Root Fossil*    |0.78% |
|*Claw Fossil*    |0.78% |
|*Dome Fossil*    |0.78% |
|*Skull Fossil*   |0.78% |
|*Armor Fossil*   |0.78% |
|*Sun Stone*      |1.17% |
|*Shiny Stone*    |1.17% |
|*Dawn Stone*     |1.17% |
|*Ice Stone*      |1.17% |
|*Dusk Stone*     |1.17% |
|*Thunder Stone*  |1.17% |
|*Fire Stone*     |1.17% |
|*Water Stone*    |1.17% |
|*Leaf Stone*     |1.17% |
|*Moon Stone*     |1.17% |
|*Oval Stone*     |1.94% |
|*Everstone*      |1.94% |
|*Star Piece*     |2.91% |
|*Rare Bone*      |1.94% |
|*Revive*         |2.91% |
|*Max Revive*     |0.97% |
|*Light Clay*     |1.94% |
|*Hard Stone*     |1.94% |
|*Heart Scale*    |16.50%|
|*Iron Ball*      |1.94% |
|*Odd Keystone*   |0.97% |
|*Heat Rock*      |1.94% |
|*Damp Rock*      |1.94% |
|*Smooth Rock*    |1.94% |
|*Icy Rock*       |1.94% |
|*Amplifield Rock*|1.94% |
|*Red Shard*      |7.77% |
|*Green Shard*    |7.77% |
|*Purple Shard*   |7.77% |
|*Blue Shard*     |7.77% |
|*Insect Plate*   |0.39% |
|*Dread Plate*    |0.39% |
|*Draco Plate*    |0.39% |
|*Zap Plate*      |0.39% |
|*Fist Plate*     |0.39% |
|*Flame Plate*    |0.39% |
|*Meadow Plate*   |0.39% |
|*Earth Plate*    |0.39% |
|*Icicle Plate*   |0.39% |
|*Toxic Plate*    |0.39% |
|*Mind Plate*     |0.39% |
|*Stone Plate*    |0.39% |
|*Sky Plate*      |0.39% |
|*Spooky Plate*   |0.39% |
|*Iron Plate*     |0.39% |
|*Splash Plate*   |0.39% |
|*Pixie Plate*    |0.39% |

We can't revive the fossils or use the Odd Keystone just yet but we will soon enough. The evolution stones can help you evolve your team if you manage to find them, and Heart Scales and Shards will be useful throughout the game. The remaining items are generally good hold items though you can get at least one of each somewhere else in the game as well. There is an incredible number of these throughout the game so feel free to destroy the rocks as you see them. I won't be pointing out when there are rocks in a given room but of course feel free to break them as you see them.

Back in the main part of B1F, head to the left and smash the rock to go down a ladder. You'll find a hidden *Red Shard* as well as a *Rare Candy* and an *Amplified Rock*. Back at the part with the sequence of ledges, take the rightmost path. Smash some rocks along the path to access a hidden *Exp. Candy M*. Following this path up, you'll find **Solrock** or **Lunatone**, determined randomly.

### A Trip to the Slums

Next, we're going to head on over to the Obsidia Slums. On the first floor of the main area of the slums take the top left escalator down to reach B1F. Then go between the escalators through the door here, and use the Dull Key inside. Grab a hidden *Calcium* then enter the next room.

Slums Playground Entrance Room

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Pancham           |50 |
|Pidove            |24 |
|Mankey            |15 |
|Watchog           |9  |
|**Primeape**      |2  |

Grab the *Super Repel* and enter the next room.

Slums Playground Main Room

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Pancham           |40 |
|Watchog           |19 |
|Mankey            |15 |
|Pidove            |14 |
|Trubbish          |10 |
|Primeape          |2  |

You can find a *Sun Stone* on the floor. The hidden items in this room are *Purple Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Full Heal*, and *Protein*.

You'll need to defeat the Pangoro around the room and activate the switches beyond them. Once you've defeated the third in the middle, you will get **Scraggy**! Afterwards you can pick up a *Brave Mint*, *Exp. Candy L*, and hidden *Exp. Candy XL* and *Full Restore*.

Exit this area and make your way to the top right corner of the main room in the slums. Go down the escalator then enter the room on the right side. Down the stairs you can smash some rocks and head in to a new area of the Railnet.

Underground Railnet Tracks Area

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Noibat            |30 |
|Klink             |25 |
|Geodude           |10 |
|Graveler          |10 |
|Woobat            |10 |
|Mawile            |9  |
|Skorupi           |4  |
|**Drapion**       |1  |
|Klang             |1  |

Pick up the *Light Ball* and hidden 2 *Common Candies* and *Red Shard*. You can smash the dark spot on the way to access another area. Grab the hidden *Hyper Potion*, *Purple Shard*, and *Dusk Ball* as you sneak through this path. Smash the wall on the other side and push the switch here, then go left.

We don't have Flash yet, so this area can be a bit annoying to search for items and such. In the top right corner you can smash a rock to free a guy. You'll find hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *Rock Gem* nearby. There's also a smash wall above you containing an *Ability Capsule*. Make your way down the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Green Shard*. Go down more stairs and go straight up. Inside a smash wall you can find *TMX8 Flash*... but we don't have the badge to use it yet. Darn.

Anyways, back outside you can find 2 hidden *Purple Shards*, an *Elixir*, and a *Dusk Stone*. Inside another smash wall you can find the *Cave Field Readout*. Before you leave this area though, headbutt the tall iron pole here to catch an **Aron**. Nice.

Head all the way back through the railnet and the slums to escape, then go to the Obsidia Ward Pokemon Center. The guy we saved earlier will give us *Department Store Sticker: Aron*. Very nice.

|*Iron*         |$9800          |

The Power Items downstairs may be 50% more expensive than these but you can buy them just once and use them infinitely many times while these are consumable. No reason to ever buy here.

### A Trip to Beryl Cave

Next, make your way all the way back to Beryl Ward. In the graveyard area we can smash some rocks to reach a new cave.

Beryl Cave

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Scatterbug        |30 |
|Morelull          |30 |
|Bunnelby          |15 |
|Noibat            |15 |
|**Spewpa**        |4  |
|**Shiinotic**     |4  |
|**Diggersby**     |1  |
|**Vivillon**      |1  |

On the first floor you'll find a hidden *Flying Gem*, *Burn Heal*, *Blue Shard*, and 2 *Ethers*. On the second you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Awakening*, *Great Ball*, and a *Link Stone* in the cage which you'll need to open using a lever in the other. You can also find **Nidorina** in here who will go with you after seeing the Silver Ring. Pick up the *Rock Incense* and continue to the next floor. Here, you'll find hidden *Blue Shard*, *Green Shard*, and *Purple Shard*. Exit at the bottom.

Well, we're back in the Rhodochrine Jungle, in a new area this time. You can find hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Bug Gem*, and *Big Mushroom* here, as well as *TM05 Roar*. 

On windy days, you can have a battle!

Pokemon Tribe. Field: Forest Field
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 20, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 30, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Nuzleaf, Lv. 30, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Shiftry, Lv. 55, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Just gotta find a way to hit Shiftry with a Bug move and you'll probably win here. As a reward, you'll get **Nuzleaf** by talking to it.

The totem at the top here also has Pokemon in it. For each Ill-Fated Doll you have (we only have 1) you can fight and catch a Pokemon in the sequence **Baltoy**, **Elgyem**, **Golett**. Which Pokemon this sequence starts at is randomly determined, however. If you make your way all the way back through Beryl Cave to Beryl Ward, then return without an Ill-Fated Doll in your bag on a clear day, you can catch **Natu**. 

### A Trip to Citrine Mountain

Next, we're going to cross Beryl Bridge and smash the rock here, then enter.

Citrine Mountain 2F

|Cave                   |%  |
|-----------------------|---|
|Woobat                 |30 |
|**Bergmite**           |30 |
|Phanpy                 |15 |
|**Cubchoo**            |14 |
|**Sandshrew (Alolan)** |5  |
|**Donphan**            |4  |
|**Sandslash (Alolan)** |1  |
|**Beartic**            |1  |


Start by going to the right. You'll find a hidden *Ability Capsule* and in the wall you can get **Amaura** as long as you have an Ice Heal.

Next, go down from the top of the area, grab the hidden *Super Potion* to the right then choose to go down at the fork. Go down at the fork after that to talk to **Croagunk** who will join us thanks to the Silver Ring. Grab a hidden *Burn Heal* and return to the first fork.

This time, go up. Along this path you'll find *Blue Shard*, *Shoal Salt*, *Protein*, and *Hyper Potion*. It will fork again. Down the left fork you can find a hidden *Hyper Potion*, *Purple Shard*, and *Shoal Salt* and pick up the *Short-Circuit Field Readout* here. Will be useful soon!

Back up at the fork, go right. You'll find another 2 hidden *Shoal Salts*, *Blue Shard*, and *Max Repel*. Enter the cave entrance up from here, and pick up the hidden *Red Shard* as well as the *Exp. Candy M* and *NeverMeltIce* inside. Talk to Smoochum when you're ready.

Pokemon Savage. Field: Icy Field
- Beartic, Lv. 65, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
  - Blizzard
  - Flail
  - Hail
  - Rest

This looks like quite the intimidating battle, but it has default moves. Blizzard will tear you up but it only has 5 PP, so if you can stall those out and get a Ghost type onto the field you're solid. It does like to heal but if you can set up somehow you should be ok. After winning, you'll get **Smoochum**.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Save Smoochum (+2 Blake)

## Omen Badge

That wraps up all the sidequests for now, so enter the power plant on the east side of the Beryl Bridge near Citrine Mt. 

Yureyu Power Plant

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Voltorb**       |30 |
|Klink             |30 |
|**Yamask**        |15 |
|**Duskull**       |14 |
|**Togedemaru**    |10 |
|Klang             |1  |

Enter the two rooms on either side and talk to two monitors within to see four total scenes. Return to the entrance room and go up when you're ready for the gym battle.

Entity Shade (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Short-Circuit Field
- Gengar, Lv. 35, @Wide Lens, Ability: Cursed Body, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Hypnosis
    - Dream Eater
    - Shadow Ball
    - Thunderbolt
- Dhelmise, Lv. 35, @Lum Berry, Ability: Steelworker, Brave Nature, IVs: 25
    - Brick Break
    - Giga Drain
    - Anchor Shot
    - Shadow Claw
- Rotom, Lv. 37, @Leftovers, Bold Nature, IVs: 25
    - Pain Split
    - Confuse Ray
    - Shadow Ball
    - Discharge
- Banette, Lv. 36, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: Cursed Body, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Shadow Claw
    - Knock Off
    - Dazzling Gleam
    - Destiny Bond
- Doublade, Lv. 37, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: No Guard, Brave Nature, IVs: 31 (0 Speed)
    - Gyro Ball
    - Shadow Claw
    - Brick Break
    - Swords Dance
- Mimikyu, Lv. 38, @Sitrus Berry, Ability: Disguise, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thunderbolt
    - Swords Dance
    - Shadow Claw
    - Play Rough

Finally time to take on the Ghost-type leader. If you check your field notes for Short-Circuit right away you'll probably notice some of the things that make Shade difficult to fight - most of his Ghost-type moves get a boost on this field, but so do the Electric-type moves on half of his team. He also has near full IV's on his entire team for the first time. Gengar is a solid lead that likes to hit really hard or put you to sleep, so you might need to plan ahead with some priority or anti-sleep measures. Doublade and Banette give themselves a bit of bulk with their seeds while Mimikyu's Disguise ability infamously gives it a free turn to get to +2 Attack or revenge kill for free. 

That said, there are a lot of fairly reliable ways to beat the Entity. One lies in the typing: if you can't beat him, join him. Your own Ghost type moves will also be boosted by the field, so something like Unburden Drifblim or your own fast Banette will probably work out well here. There also isn't really anything that effectively can stop a fast Dark type other than Mimikyu, so you can try to overwhelm him with super-effective damage that way as well. The field will also switch to the normal Factory Field when you use certain Electric-type moves, so if you have a strategy using Gear Grind or an Electric-type core you could probably make that work once you get past Rotom. If you've beat all the trainers to this point I'm sure you can find a way to defeat Mr. Smiles.

After you win, you'll get the *Omen Badge* as well as *TM65 Shadow Claw*. Our new cap is Lv. 45 and we can of course use Flash now.

# Poison In Vein

Head out from the Abandoned Power Plant and return to Jasper Ward and attempt to enter Peridot. You'll meet up with Cain here, so follow him into the Police Station. 

Before we continue, there is a pretty awesome Pokemon we can get right now. Head over to the Lapis Alleyway during a windy night. There, you'll find **Murkrow**!

## Blacksteam Factory

Head to the factory on the west side of Peridot. We can talk to the characters here for some points.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Cain we can trust Ace (+1 Ace, +1 Amaria, -1 Cain)
- Tell Cain we cannot trust Ace (+1 Cain, -1 Ace)

Talk to Ace and tell them your favorite nature, and they'll give you the respective *Mint*.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Get a mint from Ace (+1 Ace)

Talk to Amaria to get on top of the building, and head in. Defeat the grunts, then go down the stairs.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Amaria you trust her (+1 Amaria)
- Tell Amaria you don't trust her (-1 Amaria)

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Ace you think they might be a double double agent (+1 Ace)
- Tell Ace you don't think they could be a double double agent (-1 Ace)

With that, we'll be plunked into a cage with a bunch of Pokemon. Essentially we need to combine Loudred's powers of deafening, Jigglypuff's powers of putting the guard to sleep, and Abra's powers of teleportation to move Pokemon around and attack the cages. In the top left if we saved the day-care couple and talked to the Meteor in Coral Ward, you'll see a Ditto. To get this Ditto, wake up Abra with Loudred, then use Abra to teleport Vanillite out of the top left cage. Then use Abra again to teleport Makuhita to the top left cage. Talk to that cage to get **Ditto**! 

From here, teleport Vanillite out of the cage nearest the guard - I will call this the "attack" cage. You'll want to then teleport Cyndaquil into the attack cage. The guard will stop us from attacking however. So, talk to Loudred to lose your hearing then to Jigglypuff to put the guard to sleep. Make Cyndaquil attack the bars.

Repeat this process twice more, with Vanillite and Roggenrola in the attack cage, and you'll be able to escape. You can use Loudred to wake up the guard for a battle if you'd like. What's better, you can even teleport the guard into a cage. Nice.

Pick up a hidden *Dire Hit* on this floor, then go down the stairs to the left. In this room you can find a *Magnet Powder*, *Exp. Candy L*, *TM49 Echoed Voice* and the *PULSE Readout 4*. 

Head back upstairs and take the stairs on the right to 1F. Beat the grunts and activate the wall panels. Pick up a *Super Potion* and hidden *Purple Shard* and *Super Repel*. 

Towards the bottom of the area you'll find more stairs, so take these to go up. Go to the right here and you'll find a machine with some green lights on it. Inside, you can get *Exp. Candy L*. You can also find a *Thunderstone* and a hidden *Revive*. Activate the panel at the top and go back down. To the left, you'll see an open door. Get ready for battle.

Meteor Admin ZEL (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Factory Field
- Glaceon, Lv. 37, @Never-Melt Ice, Ability: Ice Body, Hardy Nature, IVs: 31
    - Ice Shard
    - Icy Wind
    - Mirror Coat
    - Bite
- Espeon, Lv. 37, @Twisted Spoon, Ability: Magic Bounce, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Morning Sun
    - Psychic
    - Signal Beam
    - Yawn
- Umbreon, Lv. 37, @Lum Berry, Ability: Synchronize, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Moonlight
    - Assurance
    - Quick Attack
    - Confuse Ray
- PULSE Muk, Lv. 42, @Leftovers, Ability: Protean, Modest Nature, IVs: 31. Stat Spread: 105/105/70/40/97/250. 
    - Sludge Wave
    - Mud Bomb
    - Muddy Water
    - Discharge

This time ZEL comes at us with both a PULSE and three Eeveelutions. The first three members of the team aren't particularly awful - something with a bit of physical bulk and some healing can take Umbreon and a fast physical attacker or two can deal with Glaceon and Espeon.

Of course, the PULSE can be difficult to deal with. It has a bit more speed than Tangrowth, but still not enough that you won't be able to outspeed it with most Pokemon. It's Protean ability gives it STAB on field boosted Discharge and Muddy Water and makes it a bit hard to plan your offense since it changes types. While its 97 Sp. Atk isn't monumental, with 105 HP, 250 Special Defense, and Leftovers, you won't really be able to do anything to it with special moves. Knock Off is a good idea here to prevent it's recovery, or you can opt to hit really hard with two or three physical attackers that are able to capitalize on Protean with moves super effective against Poison / Ground / Water / Electric depending on what it's used last. 

Once you win, you'll get the *Harbor Key*. 

## Apophyll Beach

Make your way to the Coral Ward and enter the only remaining locked warehouse. Inside, you can take the boat to Apophyll Beach!

As soon as you enter, go straight left and weave between the hills to get a *Wave Incense*.

Apophyll Beach

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|

|**Palossand**     |2  |**Corphish**      |5  |                  |   |
|                  |   |**Binacle**       |5  |                  |   |

You can also catch **Pyukumuku** chilling all around the beach.

Hidden along this part of the beach you can find a *Green Shard*, 4 *Shoal Shells*, 2 *Red Shards*, *Hyper Potion*, 2 *Stardusts*, 2 *Pokesnax*, *Common Candy*, *Full Heal*, *Blue Shard*. 

You'll enter the Apophyll Academy map by going to the left at the top. Go all the way around the academy sticking to this map: hidden here are *Super Potion*, *Shoal Shell*,  *Blue Shard*, *Full Heal*, and *Soft Sand*. Back down at the academy's front entrance, go down from here. You'll find hidden *Red Shard*, *Hyper Potion*, *Great Ball*, *Red-Hots*.

Apophyll Academy / Apophyll Beach West

|Rock Smash        |%  |Old Rod           |%  |

|Binacle           |1  |                  |   |

Before we continue the story, head to the left side of the academy to reach a new section of beach. Across the wide band from the Pyrous Mountain entrance at the bottom to the Apophyll Cave entrance at the top, you'll find hidden *Swift Wing*, *Green Shard*, *Star Piece*, *Telluric Seed*, 3 *Shoal Shells*, 2 *Stardusts*, 2 *Purple Shards*, *Exp. Candy L*, *X Sp. Def*, and *Red Shard*. 

If it is storming, you can find a **Corsola** on the left side of the area who will join you in exchange for snax.

Head back to the Apophyll Academy. Now, we're going to head inside.

Apophyll Academy Shop

|Item           |Price      |

|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Super Repel*  |$700       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |

Head up to reach the middle part of the area. Fight some trainers and pick up a hidden *Guard Spec.* Now we are going to enter the six doors in this area: the top left has a *Black Belt*, the girl in the bottom left wants us to steal a TV for her (in a bit), the Dudebro in the top right wants Protein in exchange for his *Ashen Beach Field Readout*, the guy in the middle right will give us *Pure Incense*, the bottom right room contains a person who will tell us about the *unrealtime* password and a person who judges Hidden Power types. 

Enter the area at the top, then go up the stairs. Talk to every NPC here and agree to study with those who ask. One is a tutor.

Apophyll Academy Move Tutor

|Move       |Price          |

|Gastro Acid|1 Blue Shard   |
|Recycle    |2 Purple Shards|
|Endeavor   |3 Green Shards |
|Pain Split |3 Red Shards   |

Head out the door to the right, then go down. In the next room talk to the NPCs again and study with them. Head out the door to the right and talk to the girl on the path to get **Meditite**. 

Relationship Point Chocies:
- Obtain Meditite (+1 Victoria)

Back down from here, attempt to steal the TV. Once you win, return to the girl who requested it to get *Department Store Sticker: Meditite*.

|*Charti Berry* |$1200          |
|*Chople Berry* |$1200          |

The type berries are all pretty useful when you need them, but I would recommend only stocking up when you know you need some because of the price.

Anyways, back in Apophyll we are next going to explore the optional area Apophyll Cave at the very top of the beach.

## Apophyll Cave

Apophyll Cave 1F

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |

|Numel             |18 |                  |   |
|**Stunfisk**      |7  |                  |   |

We will eventually be able to trade Stunfisk later on, so get one if you can.

In item balls you can find the *Oval Charm*, and *Dragon Memory*. Hidden on the first floor is a *Heat Rock*, *Blue Shard*, *Super Potion*, and *Exp. Candy M*.

The NPC in the top right will do an in-game trade: your Ledian for his **Shieldon**.

Apophyll Cave 2F

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |

|**Crustle**       |1  |                  |   |

On the second floor you can find in item balls *Exp. Candy L*, *Water Stone*, and *Zoom Lens*, while hidden items include *Red Shard*, *Ether*, *Potion*, *Paralyze Heal*, and *Burn Heal*.

## Pyrous Mountain

Now we can continue with the story. Head into the meditation area to the south of the academy and talk to the pink haired lady.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Kiki you are a new student (+1 Cal, +1 Victoria)

Head into the back room of the academy and talk to Kiki again. She will tell us that we have to battle Victoria or we have to battle Cal. We actually can do both of them, so I will cover both fights. If you feel like skipping one of them, you can.

To fight Victoria, head into the courtyard of the academy.

Apprentice Victoria (2x Choc Ice Cream). Field: Ashen Beach

    - Iron Head
    - Fire Fang

Victoria is starting to really beef up her team but still isn't incredibly tough. She picked up a Mienfoo and finally evolved her other four team members, so they can actually deal damage now. You'll notice from the field notes that Strength and Meditate are boosted on this field, so watch out for those. With good coverage and/or exploiting the field you can win this battle!

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Victoria at Apophyll Academy (+1 Victoria)

Now I will tackle climbing Pyrous Mountain. We aren't required to go up here yet as you only need to fight one of them, but we will need to climb it eventually. It is located at the bottom left corner of Apophyll Beach.

Pyrous Mountain

|Cave                   |%  |

|Numel                  |25 |

|Graveler               |6  |
|**Dugtrio (Alolan)**   |4  |
|**Magcargo**           |1  |

You can also find Magcargo by smashing the nearby pillars. Anyways, nothing to do on 1F so go to B1F via the ladder. You'll see a pillar glowing, which means we can drain lava by rock smashing it. Do so, then go down the ladder to the left. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and drain the lava. Head up the ladder and immediately come back down. If it is still glowing, you can smash the pillar to get **Turtonator**. This is one of two possibilities of a randomly determined event.

Back on B1F, you'll see that the lava has drained, so go into the empty pool and go down. Head down the ladder here, and you'll find a hidden *Charcoal*. If you didn't get Turtonator earlier, there will be a **Heatmor** here to catch. Back upstairs, jump down the hole in the pool to get a *Flame Orb* as well as the *Super-heated Field Readout*.

Head back to 1F, where the lava will now be drained as well. Follow the path up to 3F. A lava pool will force you to the left back to 2F, where you can drain the lava. Take the ladder to 1F then head to the left to drain it again. Finally, return to B1F then B2F to finish draining the lava as we did before. 

Make your way back to 3F, then go across the empty pool. On 4F you can find a hidden *X Defend* before exiting to the peak. The peak hides a *Exp. Candy L*.

    - Solar Beam
    - Lava Plume

Cal now has a full team of six and of course gets the full benefit of the field. It boosts Scald as well as the Fire moves, and can turn into the Burning Field if Magmortar gets to use Lava Plume. Aside from Scald your own Water types will have a tougher time on this field. Luckily, he still makes some suboptimal moves - his Typhlosion hits hardest with Solar Beam and his Charizard is physical, for example. Past Hakamo-o a Rock type or two can pretty much destroy his whole team. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Cal atop Pyrous Mountain (+2 Cal)

Return to Kiki's room once you're done with your chosen battle(s) and talk to them inside.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Victoria you cannot keep a secret (-1 Victoria)

## VS. The Sensei

To finish off this section, we have to battle Kiki in the main courtyard. Prepare your team because this is a toughie. Make sure to save before, just in case.

Man this fight kicks my butt on at least half of my replays. Ashen Beach field has so many little things that help her team of six fully evolved Fighting types that you really have to be on your toes to survive this battle. Her lead either will go straight for a field boosted Strength if your lead is weak or will set up +3 Attack on the first turn, so it is hard to immediately get momentum. In the back is Toxicroak who loves setting up and punishing you with Sucker Punch, Hitmonlee, who will outspeed the whole world thanks to Unburden, Gallade who... is just OK honestly, Lucario who is the sole special attacker and loves to get a double boost with field-boosted Calm Mind, and Medicham, who hits like a truck. Medicham and Lucario also ignore accuracy and evasion!

This field can't be changed naturally, so you can try your best to work within it. One obvious answer within is that Psychic, Zen Headbutt, and Calm Mind get boosts here, so if you can get around Hitmonlee and Toxicroak's priority/speedy dark moves you can sweep that way somehow. Stoutland and Sandslash's Sand Rush is always on and could help with certain strategies. The Sand and Mud moves also get boosted here as do Muddy Water and Surf, so if you need extra damage you may consider those. Otherwise, it's really all just about maintaining some kind of momentum. If you're able to bait out Toxicroak's 5 Sucker Punches very carefully you can set up on it for example. Your own uses of Nature Power into Meditate can turn many physical attackers into potential sweepers, so that's something to consider. This one is hard for me everytime but I always eventually figure it out, so can you!

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Kiki on your first try (+1 Victoria)
- Defeat Kiki on the second, etc. try (-2 Victoria)

|                  |   |**Exeggcute**     |15 |

With that, we can start to explore this island. Note that many item balls are Foongus in disguise.

The first island has a *Potion* and hidden *Pretty Wing*. The next area contains a *Great Ball* and hidden *Hyper Potion*. Before cutting the tree go to the left to get 
a hidden *Red Shard* and *TM83 Infestation*. 

Cut the tree and go right. Before going down the ledge you can get an *Antidote* as well as hidden *Ice Gem*, *Resist Wing* and 2 *TinyMushrooms*. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* below.

On the next island to the right, you can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Tiny Mushroom*,*Red Shard*, and *Synthetic Seed*. Following the path behind the Foongus in the bottom left you can get a *Shiny Stone*.

Back up from here, cross to the right. You can find a hidden *Green Shard* on this island. At the top left there is a path across the water that will lead to a hidden *Thunderstone*. 

Head down the ledge on the east island. You can find a hidden *Swift Wing* here and follow the ivy up from here to get the *Swamp Field Readout*. Briefly stopping on the middle island, head down using the ivy to pick up a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* then head left.

You can head down as soon as you touch land to get a *Miracle Seed*. Back on land, you'll find a hidden *Great Ball* and *Guard Spec.* Use the Light Shard and head left. Before continuing left to the next island, you can go down via the ivy to find one hidden *Dusk Ball* and one non-hidden *Dusk Ball*. Head up and left when you're ready.

Another battle with Aster and Eclipse, this time featuring a full team, however this one shouldn't usually be too bad. Deal with Solrock and Lunatone as you usually do, then you'll have the other four. The Lycanrocs and Passimian are speedy and hit hard, but after a few turns they'll all become slowed down by the field, allowing you to capitalize on their low bulk. Oranguru likes to use Instruct and/or hit both of your Pokemon with Nature Power into field-boosted Muddy Water, so be careful of that, but you should be able to take it down otherwise without too much trouble.

Left from here you'll grab a hidden *Potion*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Ether*, and *Escape Rope*. Cut the tree up from here to get another hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Go down from here. You'll find a *Magical Seed* and hidden *Purple Shard*. Head down and right to grab a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* and a hidden *Green Shard* a bit further... and we can finally enter the building here. 

Pick up the *PULSE Readout 6* and talk to the machine in the top to reveal a secret passageway. Heal or switch up your team and go up.

Meteor Admin Taka (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Factory Field

Time to fight Taka again. Although he has added Klefki and Gligar to his team, neither should be too threatening. Just be careful of Exeggutor hitting hard with its STABs and Nature Power into Gear Grind and also Chatot setting up on you.

Accept Cain's fast travel request. 

## The Battle for Apophyll

Once you're back on Apophyll, prepare your team. It's worth pointing out that in the battle winning is optional, but there are strategies to win if you're interested. Head down to Pyrous Mountain.

Head in and you'll be partnered up with Victoria.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Try to leave Pyrous while partnered with Victoria (-2 Victoria)

Anyways, if you haven't explored Pyrous yet now you'll have to, so follow the directions in the above Pyrous section if you'd like. If you have, you just have to make it back up to the peak using the straightforward path, beating grunts as you go.

Once you reach the peak, it's time for that battle I was talking about. 

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to win this battle.**

Meteor Leader Solaris (2x Full Heal). Field: Super-heated Field
- Garchomp, Lv. 75, @Leftovers, Ability: Rough Skin, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Dragon Rush
    - Earthquake
    - Fire Fang
    - Stone Edge

This is an "impossible battle" in the normal sense that the story will progress if you lose, but it actually does acknowledge your success with being a precondition for one of the postgame routes as well as some points. For that reason I will hide the text on my recommendations.

> You won't have an easy time with status conditions thanks to the Full Heals. There are still numerous things you can do here. The Focus Sash is always an option - putting it on a Counter Pokemon or something with attack-lowering moves can open it up to not kill some of your Pokemon. For an easier time, Bastiodon and Sudowoodo both get Sturdy and Metal Burst / Counter, Sharpedo can Speed Boost and use Destiny Bond, Murkrow can use Prankster Perish Song... the possibilities for this fight are vast.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Cain, +1 Victoria, +1 Cal, +1 Shade, +1 Anna, +3 Taka)

## Byxbysion Wasteland

After the scenes on top of Pyrous, head back to Reborn City and go to the South Obsidia Ward. Talk to Cain to enter the Byxbysion Wasteland.

|Graveler          |5  |**Inkay**         |10 |

In this first area you can find 2 hidden *Blue Shards*, *Green Shard*, *Potion*, *Telluric Seed*, and *Poison Gem*. Follow the ledge at the bottom and pick up a hidden *Full Heal* and *Red Shard*. A nearby slide will take you to a hidden *Green Shard* and *Escape Rope*. Read the grave while you're here to initiate a quest.

Enter the building and emerge at the top. On this upper platform you can find a hidden *Green Shard*. First, we will be going up, so take the ledge up in the top left corner. You'll find hidden *Genius Wing*, *Ability Capsule*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, and *Carbos*. In the top right side there is a canister you can talk to that will turn red - we will need to do this to multiple canisters across the wasteland to access a secret area. In the top left corner of this area you can enter a cave. Following it to the left and out you can get a hidden *Cotton Candy*. Head back and down the ledge, making your way back through the building with stairs to emerge at the top.

Take the slide to the right now. You can find hidden *X Defend*, *X Speed*, *Hyper Potion*, *Exp. Candy L*, *Poke Ball*, *Purple Shard*, *Green Shard*, *Poison Barb*, *Purple Shard*, and *Protein*. Up from here you can find another canister to turn red. Up and to the left you can go through a building to find a hidden *Black Sludge*. Head to the bottom left of this segment. Hop down one ledge. Here you'll find another canister to turn red, the *Wasteland Field Readout* hiding behind a rock as well as hidden *Blue Shard* and *Peppermint*. From here you'll have to go back through the building and down the slide to return to this area.

In the bottom right section, use the Light Shard and talk to Ace for a battle.

Ace has a full team but it isn't particularly bolstered by the field. Be careful not to let Honchkrow or Clefable sweep you and I'm sure you can find a way through this fight.

Talk to the screen beyond them to unlock a door down and to the right. Exit the building at the top and go down the first slide. You'll find a *Lax Incense* up here. Go down the slide to the left. You'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Heart Scale*, and *Calcium*, as well as another canister to turn red. Down the ledge you'll need to go through the building again, this time go right. Grab the hidden *Potion*. 

In the top right corner of the area, you can find hidden *Ground Gem*, *Purple Shard*, *Ether*, and *Ice Heal*. Talk to the final canister to turn red.

Talk to Cain if you'd like then enter the building. Heal and prepare your team, save, then enter the room on the left.

    - Leaf Blade
    - Swords Dance
    - Sucker Punch
    - Spirit Shackle

Fern is back with a full team. His general strategies remain the same: Krookodile will try to sweep, Roserade will hit hard and fast with Giga Drain to heal itself, and Decidueye will try to Sucker Punch you and/or sweep with Swords Dance. Scyther hits fairly hard with its STABs, especially Technician Wing Attack. Fraxure and Rhydon aren't as bad but you still have to be careful. 

Past the Ground types, a Poison type can abuse the field to sweep the field. Nature Power turns into Gunk Shot and, as an added bonus, is immune to Sucker Punch. Once you can get past Roserade he doesn't have an incredible amount of speed so a boosted sweeper can probably succeed here.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeat Fern on the first try (+1 Aya, +1 Hardy)

After you win, we are able to proceed to a gym battle, but opening up the canisters actually opened up a second half of the wasteland we can explore for some goodies, so we'll go ahead and do that now. This is optional.

## Byxbysion Tunnels

Head down from the wasteland hideout, smash the rock and go down the ledge. You'll see that the left building door is now open. 

Byxbysion Tunnels 1

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Zubat             |30 |

|Onix              |10 |
|Mawile            |6  |
|Golbat            |4  |

The tunnel is straightforward - enter the cave entrance at the end to reach another tunnel.

Byxbysion Tunnels 2

|Cave              |%  |

|Trubbish          |20 |

|Koffing           |10 |
|Nidorina          |5  |
|**Nidorino**      |5  |

Emerge on the other side and go down the slide. Grab a hidden *Synthetic Seed* and go down the next slide. Here a guy will tell you about the password *nodamageroll*. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and enter the next cave. Follow the path through to the outside. The next area will have a hidden *Sticky Barb* and *Full Heal*, and a *Poison Barb* to the right. Enter the next cave entrance. 

Interact with both canisters to make the bookshelf in the back get moved over. Inside the next room you can find a hidden *Sun Stone*. 

Inside the room to the left, you can use an Odd Keystone if you've found one via mining to get **Spiritomb**. The second room contains *TM66 Payback*. Prepare yourself and enter the third room.

    - Gunk Shot
    - Pain Split
    - Stockpile
    - Drain Punch

Mr. Bigglesworth is tough and also our first opponent that is EV trained. You can set up while the Trubbish are out with your own Steel or Poison type then destroy him. Sad :(

Behind you'll find *TM09 Venoshock* as well as the *PULSE Readout 0*. 

That's it for this part, so return to the room with the two canisters. Hidden behind the left one is another tunnel. As you follow the path you can get a hidden *Focus Sash*. Nice.

Once you appear outside, go down the slide here and grab a hidden *Moon Stone*. Go in the cave and head up the ladder, then go right back down to reach a new area. Sadly the mining rock here is all we can get right now, so head up the ladder and go down the slide then make your way back to the Wasteland hideout.

## Blight Badge

Enter the gym room, save, and talk to Aya.

Wasteland Punk Aya (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Wasteland Field
- Nidoqueen, Lv. 41, @Black Sludge, Ability: Poison Point, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sludge Wave
    - Stealth Rock

- Dragalge, Lv. 45, @Black Sludge, Ability: Adaptability, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sludge Wave
    - Shadow Ball
    - Hydro Pump
    - Dragon Pulse

Aya is another difficult doubles gym leader. The field boosts her Sludge Waves and Venusaur's Power Whip for one. Entry Hazards are all turned into end-of-turn effects - Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rocks will do damage and the former will Poison your Pokemon. With the speedy Nidoqueen and Salazzle paired with the bulky Toxapex and Dragalge, with Venusaur and Drapion for coverage, her team is well suited to deal with many of the strategies you might think to use. Earthquake is weakened by 4 times on this field, so that's not really an option. 

The key to this battle in my experience is letting Toxapex hang out on the left side and do everything in your power to incapacitate and knock out the Pokemon on the right. Toxapex does have Merciless which is always on, but still doesn't hit incredibly hard and will probably be going last unless it has gotten off a lot of Icy Wind. For that reason, putting Psychic-type attackers, and/or Steel/Poison-type defenders on the field and letting them tank attacks and knock out the threats will probably pay out. Ice is also a pretty good offensive type here, note that Freeze Dry can take four of her Pokemon super-effectively. You can also use your own entry hazard spam or the Telluric seed to boost a sweeper. If you could figure out Shelly way back when I think you can find a way to best Aya.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Beat Aya on the first try (+1 Hardy, +1 Fern)

Once you win you'll get the *Blight Badge*, *TM34 Sludge Wave*, and get a Level 50 cap finally. We also get to use Strength in the field, finally!

# Of Fathers Forgotten

Make your way all the way back out of the Wasteland. You'll find Cain near the exit. Prepare for a fight.

    - Water Pledge
    - Icy Wind
    - Disarming Voice
    - Sing

Another fight with Cain, this time on a field that benefits his team to some extent. Most of his Pokemon aren't very fast, so a fast sweeper or two can probably clean house. Just watch out for Muk who hits like a truck and also has Minimize for extra shenanigans.

Return to South Obsidia Ward.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Say you believe Cal (+1 Cal)
- Say you don't believe Cal (-1 Cal)

Cal will give you *TMX4 Strength*! 

## Strength Exploration

Having Strength means there is a lot of exploration that we can now do. First of all, put Chingling into your party with the Soothe Bell attached. We'll need it evolved for a quest soon, so might as well take advantage of all the walking we are about to do.

First, note that the Pokemarts have new inventory now.

Default Mart (5 Badges)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Super Potion* |$700       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Super Repel*  |$700       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |
|*Great Ball*   |$600       |

Next, make your way all the way up to Citrine Mountain 2F via Beryl Bridge. Go down and right. You'll see a strength boulder. Push it from the top so it goes down. Then, make your way around to the left and step across the ice path that is now open. You will find a hidden *Shoal Salt* and *Red Shard* then find *TM94 Secret Power*. Exit the mountain.

Make your way west to the Beryl Cemetery. Victoria is down from here.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Victoria in the cemetery (+2 Victoria)

Next, we're gonna return to Byxbysion Wasteland. After exiting the tall building, head up over the ledge and enter the cave at the top. Push the boulder into the hole and follow it, then go into the now accessible cave. Prepare for a fight and talk to the grave. 

Spectral Kiki. Field: Wasteland Field
- Medicham, Lv. 65, Ability: Pure Power, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Meditate
    - Thunder Punch
    - Drain Punch
    - Ice Punch

Another tough fight with a single Pokemon but at this point you should have a strategy to deal with these.

Win and you'll obtain **Misdreavus**.

Back outside in the wasteland, make your way to the tunnels area and enter the room with two canisters. Head through the secret path to the left. When you get outside, go down the slide and enter the next room. Take the ladder up then immediately back down. Now we can move this boulder aside! Jump down the hidden ledge and move the next boulder to the left, then go up.

Here, you can find an *Exp. Candy L*, *TM12 Taunt*, and hidden *Ability Capsule* and *Nugget*. On rainy days you can also find a **Squirtle** chilling in the fountain, which we can catch. This is the first of the starters we can obtain aside from the starter table at the beginning of the game.

Return to the wasteland proper, and enter the tall building with stairs on the left side of the map. Show the Squirtle we caught to the guy inside for a *Data Chip*.

Next, take the boat to Apophyll. Head inside Pyrous Mountain and make your way up to 3F. Carefully maneuver the boulder into the hole here and follow it down. You'll find Tepig here, but talk to it and it will flee. Next, make your way to B1F and go to the right. Move the boulder and talk to Tepig again. Grab *TM37 Sandstorm* while you're here. Finally, make your way to the peak. Talk to **Tepig** and you'll be able to catch it!

Exit and take the boat to Azurine Island. At night, if your Chingling has enough friendship, it will evolve into **Chimecho**. Take Chimecho into the building where we battled Taka and show it to a guy here to obtain **Chikorita**. 

## Yureyu Building

With that out of the way, head into the Underground Railnet and use Strength to reach the top. Grab the now-accessible hidden *Red Shard* and enter the door with the Y. This room has a hidden *Great Ball* and *Dragon Gem*. Upstairs is a hidden *Exp. Candy M* and outside you can find a hidden *Link Stone* and *Exp. Candy L*. Head into the Yureyu building.

You'll be partnered with Cain.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk with Cain while you're in Yureyu (+1 Cain)

Relationship Point Choices:
- Try to leave Yureyu while partnered with Cain (-1 Cain)

It's a very straightforward area: defeat all the Meteor grunts as you make your way up. Once we reach the floor that Sigmund is on, we'll have a story choice to make.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to refuse fighting Sigmund at Yureyu.**

Relationship Point Choices:
- Say Yes to Sigmund asking if you'll fight him (+1 Heather, -1 Sigmund)
- Say No to Sigmund asking if you'll fight him (+1 Sigmund, -1 Heather, -1 Cain)

### Choice: Fight Sigmund

If you said no to Sigmund, skip ahead to the next section.

Dr. Sigmund Connal (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Factory Field
- Musharna, Lv. 45, @Amplifield Rock, Ability: Telepathy, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Psychic Terrain
    - Moonlight
    - Psyshock
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Drampa, Lv. 46, Ability: Berserk, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Thunderbolt
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Nature Power
    - Hyper Voice
- Raichu (Raichu-Alola), Lv. 46, Ability: Surge Surfer, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Volt Switch
    - Psychic
    - Nasty Plot
    - Thunderbolt
- Hypno, Lv. 47, @Wide Lens, Ability: Insomnia, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Hypnosis
    - Nasty Plot
    - Psychic
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Rotom, Lv. 47, Ability: Levitate, Timid Nature, IVs: 25
    - Thunderbolt
    - Hex
    - Will-O-Wisp
    - Foul Play
- Electivire, Lv. 48, Ability: Motor Drive, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thunder Punch
    - Fire Punch
    - Low Kick
    - Ice Punch

Thanks to the assistance of Cain, this one shouldn't be too bad. Musharna will use Psychic Terrain like last time, and his Electric and Psychic core will try to wear you down. The Factory field will boost the former and the Psychic Terrain the latter, so make sure you neutralize whatever the biggest threat of your two opponent is each turn and you'll probably win.

### Choice: Don't Fight Sigmund

If you said yes to Sigmund, skip ahead to the next section.

Meteor Admin Sirius (2x Hyper Potion). Field: No Field
- Minior (Minior-Violet-Meteor), Lv. 45, Ability: Shields Down, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Shell Smash
    - Charge Beam
    - Power Gem
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Tyrantrum, Lv. 46, Ability: Strong Jaw, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Rock Slide
    - Crunch
    - Dragon Claw
    - Dragon Dance
- Toucannon, Lv. 46, Ability: Skill Link, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Beak Blast
    - Rock Blast
    - Tailwind
    - Roost
- Manectric, Lv. 47, Ability: Static, Timid Nature, IVs: 30
    - Flamethrower
    - Volt Switch
    - Discharge
    - Snarl
- Seviper, Lv. 47, @Leftovers, Ability: Shed Skin, Careful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Throat Chop
    - Poison Jab
    - Rest
    - Aqua Tail
- Chandelure, Lv. 48, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: Infiltrator, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Heat Wave
    - Energy Ball
    - Psychic
    - Shadow Ball

Thanks to the assistance of Cain, this one shouldn't be too tough. You'll have to be careful of Minior setting up. Otherwise his Pokemon are generally fast and strong but frail, so if you have good type advantages and basic doubles strategies you can certainly do it.

## Underground Railnet East

Back on the ground floor, head east to enter another part of the railnet. This room is pretty huge - scattered around you can find a hidden *Awakening*, *Revive*, *Super Potion*, *Resist Wing*, *Red-Hots*, *Swift Wing*, *Purple Shard*, *Protein*, *Cheri Berry*, 3 *Blue Shards*, 2 *Pokesnaxs*, and *Super Repel*.

You can also find a bunch more of those shallow walls that you can use Rock Smash on. Behind these are *House Key*, *Iron Ball*, *Corrupted Poke Ball*, and *TM44 Rest*. You can also open the gate to the left to create a shortcut to the Aron room. 

Talk to Shelly on the right side of the area, then enter the train at the bottom of the map. Back outside, you'll need to use levers to connect this train to the exit area on the right. Essentially you can just follow the tracks until you hit a roadblock, then backtrack and click the lever and follow the new path until you are all done. Talk to Noel when you have the correct layout. Re-enter the train, talk to Shelly if you'd like.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Shelly she was helpful (+1 Shelly)
- Tell Shelly she was not helpful (-1 Shelly)

Talk to Charlotte - CHOO CHOO!

## Tanzan Cove

We will emerge in a new area. Here, you'll find a *Purple Shard*, *Full Heal*, *Normal Gem*, and *Elemental Seed*. If it's raining, a guy on this map will tell us about the password *stablweather*. You can actually choose whether to go to the Belrose Manse via Tanzan Mountain first, or to go to Spinel Town via the forest first. Here, we will go to Belrose first, but you can skip this section and come back to it after Spinel if you'd like.

Tanzan Mountain 1F

|Cave                   |%  |

|Kecleon                |14 |
|**Sandile**            |6  |

On the left as you walk in, you'll see whichever of **Solrock** and **Lunatone** that you didn't get to catch earlier.

On this map, you'll find hidden *X Speed*, *Pokesnax*, *Hyper Potion*, 2 *Blue Shards*, *Revive*, *Ground Gem*, *Steel Gem*, *Escape Rope*, *Ultra Ball*, *Purple Shard*, and a visible *Exp. Candy XL*.

Talk to Charlotte then emerge at the top into Tanzan Cove.

|------------------|---|
|Goldeen           |70 |
|**Seaking**       |30 |

In this area you can find a hidden *Escape Rope*, *Green Shard*, *Guard Spec.*, *Blue Shard*, *Peppermint*, *Pokesnax*, *Heart Scale*, *Rose Incense*, and *Elemental Seed*.

Enter the house at the top.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Enter Belrose Manse before going to Voclain Estate (+1 Noel, +1 Laura)

To the left you can see something glowing in a bookshelf. Interact with it to get the *Family Picture* for a sidequest way down the road. Anyways, talk to everyone in the house then head out.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Shelly in Belrose Manse (+1 Shelly)

## Chrysolia Forest

Make your way back through Tanzan Mountain and enter the forest.

Chrysolia Forest

|Pineco            |10 |

Make your way forward and around to the left. You'll see a cave entrance hidden behind a tree - walk up to this tree and it will teleport away.

Chrysolia Spring 1F

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Shellos           |70 |
|Barboach          |30 |

More importantly, you'll find a *Mystic Water* and hidden *Link Stone* inside. 

Back outside, head to the left and down, and attempt to exit the forest. A nearby tree will disappear, so follow the newly created path. By now you've noticed that stuff is teleporting in and out - in general we want to follow the linear path forwards, even if it does take us through parts we've seen before.

Towards the bottom of the area you'll see a single tree blocking off an open patch of grass, approaching the tree will make it disappear. Down from here you'll find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Exp. Candy L*, and *Heart Scale*. To the right, you can talk to someone for the *Grassy Terrain Field Readout* and pick up a *Mild Mint* and a *Hasty Mint*. Enter the train to the left, and pick up the egg. It'll be **Cacnea** or **Maractus**, randomly determined.

Head back up and go left, continuing our linear travel through the teleporting tree forest. In the bottom right part of the forest you'll see a lone tree guarding a patch of grass - you know what to do. Follow this path to reach a cave.

Lost Railcave

|Cave                   |%  |
|-----------------------|---|
|Kecleon                |29 |
|**Graveler (Alolan)**  |20 |

|**Smeargle**           |6  |
|**Swinub**             |5  |

Inside the railcave, start by entering the entrance that is not being pointed to by the three ends of the train tracks. Repeat this process over and over until you reach a room containing an *Ill-Fated Doll* as well as **Eevee**!

Back in the main area of the railcave, enter the room closest to two of the three rocks. Repeat this process over and over until you reach a room containing a hidden *Ability Capsule*, the *Psychic Terrain Field Readout*, and *TM32 Double Team*. 

Back in the forest, continue your circles around and around. Once you reach the upper right side of the area you'll see a path leading to the right. Here you'll find a hidden *Ability Capsule*. Head into the clearing here.

Chrysolia Forest Clearing

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |

|**Altaria**       |5  |                  |   |                  |   |

You'll find a hidden *Elemental Seed* as well as the *Burning Field Readout*, a *Quiet Mint* and an *Exp. Candy L*. This is also the Mossy Rock where you can get Leafeon. 

Finally, continue your circles in the main part of the forest until you finally reach Spinel Town.

## Spinel Town

You'll notice that everything is chaos here, teleporting like crazy. Enter a house on the left side and a girl's furniture will all disappear. She'll ask us to get it back, so head out of her house.

Down from here, there's a tree in front of a house. The tree will move when you approach it. Inside, you can return the Kadabra girl's bed, and pick up the *Good Rod*! Outside, the fountain will disappear as you approach. Heading towards the center of town, you'll see the Kadabra girl's TV on top of a building. Trying to enter the Pokemart will cause it to teleport as well. To the right, you'll see Kadabra girl's bookshelf.

Enter the left apartment building. Inside, you'll find Kadabra girl's table. In the building to the right, a person inside will offer to trade your Shelmet and Karrablast for their respective evolutions. You will also be asked to pet every Eeveelution. This is a sidequest we won't be finishing for a very long time but at least we know.

Talk to a lady sitting on the bench, and she will completely disappear. Ok then. Go down and to the right: a house here will also disappear. Beyond it you will find Kadabra girl's first chair. Her second chair is up and to the right of the Pokemon Center. Speaking of, a guy inside the center will tell us a password: *hardcap*. 

Enter the museum. Unfortunately every time we enter here it will cost $500. You can explore the museum to learn a bunch of lore. Upstairs is a person who will revive our fossils! So, that means depending on what you've found mining it is now possible to get **Omanyte**, **Kabuto**, **Lileep**, **Anorith**, **Cranidos**, and Shieldon. Unfortunately to finish the revival you have to leave the museum and pay the fee again!

Anyways, head down and out of the door upstairs here and into the door on the other side to pick up the *Eevium-Z*. We can't use Mega Stones or Z-Crystals yet. Kadabra girl's nightstand is also in here, as well as a standard Ice Cream vending machine that contains a Vanillite like in the Sweet Co.

In the downstairs area of the museum at night, you'll see two Meteor grunts. Talk to them and they will flee to Tanzan Mountain. We will get to them in a bit. There's a *Luxury Ball* in the trash to the right.

Outside, attempt to enter the Voclain Estate in the top right corner. Before you talk to Serra, talk to Bennett if you want points.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Bennett you knew Cascoon had perfect memories (+1 Bennett)

I hope they remember me killing 15 of them with Fire-type moves in Pokemon Legends Arceus. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Bennett a second time (+1 Bennett)

In the upstairs rooms, you can find *Silk Scarf*, the *Mirror Arena Field Readout*, *TM85 Dream Eater*, *Bug Memory*, and *Weakness Policy*. You'll also find Kadabra girl's last bookshelf in Bennett's room.

With that, we should now have all of the furniture back, so return to the girl to get the *Exp. All*. An excellent item that levels your whole team and prevents leveling over the cap.

Grab your Male Burmy from the PC and level it to 20 so it evolves into **Mothim**.
Return to Chrysolia Forest - you'll have to basically do the circles in reverse. On your way you'll find the house that teleported earlier. A guy inside will do an in-game trade: your Mothim for his **Bruxish**.

Down from here, you'll find the teleported fountain. **Remoraid** will jump out for you to battle.

Return to Tanzan Mountain. Inside, you'll find the grunts from earlier. Defeat them and return to the museum. Talk to the museum guy to get your choice of *Plume Fossil* or *Armor Fossil*, which you can revive for **Archen** and **Tirtouga** respectively.

## Good Rod Encounters and Other Things

Now that we have a new rod there are a lot of encounters we can now get.

Chrysolia Spring 1F

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Shellos           |60 |
|Barboach          |20 |
|**Clauncher**     |20 |

Tanzan Cove

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Basculin**      |60 |
|Mantyke           |20 |
|**Luvdisc**       |20 |

Make sure you catch a Luvdisc for an in-game trade we'll get to in a bit.

Once you return to Reborn City via the railnet, we can now snag the other gang mascot than ours. If you joined Magma Gang, head over to Lapis Alleyway. 

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Barboach          |80 |
|**Carvanha**      |20 |

If you joined Aqua Gang, head over to North Obsidia Alleyway, where you will be able to find **Houndour** inside.

Anyways, some more encounters:

Lower Peridot Ward / Azurine Island / Apophyll Beach / Coral Ward

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Muk               |60 |
|**Tentacool**     |20 |
|Skrelp            |20 |

Lower Peridot Ward Pool

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Goldeen           |60 |
|Finneon           |20 |
|Seaking           |20 |

The Underroot

|Good Rod          |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Psyduck           |60 |
|Skrelp            |20 |
|**Whiscash**      |20 |

The other important thing we can do in Reborn City is to head on over to Onyx Ward and return the House Key to the girl here to get a *Heart Scale*. She is the Move Relearner and will trade us relearned moves for Heart Scales... which we have in spades via mining. Take advantage of this as you like, then take the boat to Apophyll. 

Grab Luvdisc from the PC, then head along the outer right wall of the academy to find someone who'll do an in-game trade: your Luvdisc for their **Darumaka**. 

That wraps up this part, so head all the way back through the railnet and the forest to Spinel Town and enter the Voclain Estate.

## Rime Badge

Enter the room towards the back to reach the gym. In each room, you'll have to look for something that's wrong on one of the two sides. It could be a misplaced or miscolored item or something thematically tied to the gym. Anyways, once you find this discrepancy, smash the wall immediately above. 

For each of the three puzzle rooms (so, a max of +3), you can get the following:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Smash the correct mirror on the first try (+1 Serra)
- Smash 2-5 incorrect mirrors before finding the answer (-1 Serra)
- Smash 6-7 incorrect mirrors before finding the answer (-2 Serra)

Save before you enter the third room.

    - Sleep Powder
    - Quiver Dance
    - Signal Beam
    - Giga Drain

It's time for our first battle with Bennett. Despite mainly using the crappy early game bugs, he pretty strongly optimizes his team around the Mirror Field. All of the accuracy and evasion items and abilities raise his team's chance to get critical hits, and his Pokemon hit moderately hard and fast. Literally all but one of them have Quiver Dance too, so they'll probably try to set up on you. That said, his Bugs are all pretty frail and have lots of weaknesses - simply loading up on Rock moves will probably solve most of the problem. You can also take advantage of the Mirror Field yourself, if you'd like.

Relationship Point Choices: 
- Beat Bennett on the first try (+1 Elias, -1 Bennett)
- Beat Bennett on the second, etc. try (+1 Bennett, -1 Elias)

Break the last mirror and head into the gym arena when you're ready.

Serra is a tough gym leader that operates on a very unique field effect - instead of thinking about how to beat a Hail-team like you normally would, you really should study the field effect in detail to devise a strategy. Anyways, her Bright Powder, Wide Lens, and Synthetic Seeds as well as Snow Cloak abilities all raise accuracy or evasion and boost critical-hit rate. For that reason you won't really be able to pull off a Special Defense boosting strategy nor use your own screens. In general, physical attackers will have a much harder time here since when they miss, they take damage. Special attackers have a chance to hit anyways even when they miss - some attacks are even boosted, which explains why Serra has five special attackers. Her Jynx, Froslass, and Sandslash under Hail are all incredibly fast and like to try to crit you. On the flip side, Glaceon, Alola-tales, and Lapras are a bit tankier, the latter two like to set up free 8-turn Aurora Veil to further support their defensive strategy. All in all this is a tough fight that doubles down on the weaknesses of the Ice-type and uses the Mirror Arena to great effect.

In general, your own weather and Brick Break / Psychic Fangs to fight Aurora Veil are generally good options, but as I said the field is also tough to overcome. Luckily, as stacked the Mirror Arena is for Serra, you can pretty easily use it to your benefit as well.  There is a list of abilities that you can use to get Accuracy or Evasion, we also have access to the Lax Incense and Wide Lens at this point. All of these will allow you to get a boosted critical hit ratio - with priority, that means you can pick up some easy one shots on the glass cannons. The accuracy ones in particular will allow your physical attackers to overcome the Evasion + misses + recoil damage and capitalize on the low Defense on Serra's Pokemon. Mirror Coat is a good option that you can use situationally to boost your defensive stats. All of these are nice, but it turns out there's something EVEN BETTER that you can use. That is, Nature Power turns into Mirror Shot, which is boosted by two times and will always lower accuracy. That means any Special Attacker with access to Nature Power can use a 130 BP Steel-type move that will never miss... against a team full of Ice types - only Glaceon and Lapras take neutral damage from it. 

It's worth noting that there are a list of moves in the Field Notes that can destroy the Mirror Arena entirely. This can be another viable strategy to force Serra to play on a more even playing field. However:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Break the Mirror Field in the gym fight (-1 Serra)

Once you win, you'll get the *Rime Badge* which boosts our cap to Lv. 55. You'll also get *TM70 Aurora Veil*. 

# Sister's Keeper

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Serra on the couch after the battle (+1 Serra)

## Two Herbal Extracts

Make your way out of Spinel Town and head back towards Tanzan Mountain. You'll finally be able to enter the Pokemart here! One person sells the default items, but there is another vendor.

Chrysolia Pokemart Herb Shop

|Item               |Price  |
|-------------------|-------|
|*Herbal Extract*   |$600   |
|*Energy Powder*    |$500   |
|*Heal Powder*      |$450   |

The Powders aren't really worth it unless you're going for a Frustration build, but we will need two Herbal Extracts: one for a sidequest and one to continue the story.

If you chose to go to Spinel Town before Belrose Manse, you can read the above section on Tanzan Cove for encounters, items, etc. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Defeated Serra and got Herbal Medicine before entering the Belrose Manse (+1 Charlotte)

Anyways, head to Belrose Manse and go upstairs. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Noel without Herbal Extract in your inventory (-1 Noel)

Give the medicine to Anna and she will feel better. Head outside.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Shelly while Noel wants to battle you.

We can talk to Noel to advance the plot, but we can actually use the second Herbal Extract we got right now to get a nice reward, so I'll take care of that now. 

Head over to the Chrysolia Forest and go up. You'll find the lady that was teleported off the bench here. Give her the Herbal Extract to get *Department Store Sticker: Chansey*.

You can grab some gems if you have a strategy that relies on them such as Flying-gem Acrobatics or Unburden Normal-gem Fake Out.

With that out of the way, head back to the Tanzan Cove. Prepare your team for a battle and talk to Noel...

## Defending Belrose Manse

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Saphira you don't understand (-1 Saphira)

Relationship Point Choices:
- Tell Charlotte you want to beat Meteor faces (+1 Charlotte)

The story will diverge a little bit depending on what our choice was at Yureyu. This section gets a bit hairy since there are FOUR different story splits. Let me know if you have suggestions or spot discrepancies since I cannot play all four routes at once.

### Choice: Fought Sigmund at Yureyu

If you didn't fight Sigmund at Yureyu and instead fought Sirius, skip ahead to the next section.

Anyways, you'll have to first fight two orderlies. Afterwards, you'll be healed but thrust into another battle.

Meteor Admin Sirius (3x Hyper Potion). Field: No Field
- Minior (Minior-Violet-Meteor), Lv. 48, Ability: Shields Down, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Shell Smash
    - Dazzling Gleam
    - Power Gem
    - Psychic
- Tyrantrum, Lv. 49, Ability: Strong Jaw, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Earthquake
    - Crunch
    - Dragon Claw
    - Dragon Dance
- Toucannon, Lv. 50, Ability: Skill Link, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Beak Blast
    - Rock Blast
    - Tailwind
    - Roost
- Manectric, Lv. 50, Ability: Static, Timid Nature, IVs: 30
    - Volt Switch
    - Discharge
    - Flamethrower
    - Snarl
- Seviper, Lv. 51, @Leftovers, Ability: Shed Skin, Careful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Throat Chop
    - Poison Jab
    - Rest
    - Aqua Tail
- Chandelure, Lv. 52, @Wise Glasses, Ability: Infiltrator, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Heat Wave
    - Energy Ball
    - Psychic
    - Shadow Ball

On this route this is our first battle with Sirius, and we don't get a partner. His team is all about hitting hard with well-rounded coverage. In particular you have to watch out for his Chandelure's fast coverage, Minior's set up if you have a bad lead against it, and Manectric's fast offense and pivot move. The rest are fairly slow. At this point in the game you should have a pretty solid team that can hopefully take care of Sirius.

Afterwards, the game will give us another choice that affects the story! Either we will go upstairs or stay downstairs.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Go Upstairs after fighting Sirius (+1 Charlotte, +1 Shelly, +1 Noel, -1 Saphira, -1 Laura, -1 Sigmund)
- Stay Downstairs after fighting Sirius (+1 Charlotte, +1 Shelly, +1 Saphira)

If you chose to stay downstairs the Twins will be captured. Talk to the group in the kitchen to the right. 

If you go upstairs, this results in Laura being captured. Talk to Saphira downstairs. 

### Choice: Didn't Fight Sigmund at Yureyu

If you fought Sigmund at Yureyu, skip ahead to the next section.

Anyways, it's time for another battle with the doc.

Dr. Sigmund Connal (2x Hyper Potion). Field: No Field
- Musharna, Lv. 48, @Amplifield Rock, Ability: Telepathy, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Psychic Terrain
    - Moonlight
    - Psyshock
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Drampa, Lv. 49, Ability: Berserk, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Thunderbolt
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Nature Power
    - Hyper Voice
- Raichu (Raichu-Alola), Lv. 49, Ability: Surge Surfer, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Volt Switch
    - Psychic
    - Nasty Plot
    - Thunderbolt
- Hypno, Lv. 50, @Wide Lens, Ability: Insomnia, Modest Nature, IVs: 25
    - Hypnosis
    - Nasty Plot
    - Psychic
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Rotom, Lv. 50, Ability: Levitate, Timid Nature, IVs: 25
    - Thunderbolt
    - Hex
    - Will-O-Wisp
    - Foul Play
- Electivire, Lv. 51, Ability: Motor Drive, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Thunder Punch
    - Fire Punch
    - Low Kick
    - Ice Punch

This fight can be tough thanks to his usage of the very broken Psychic Terrain - it will double Musharna's speed, boost his Psychic attacks plus Hex, and make Hypnosis actually reliable. As before you can consider knocking out Musharna then trying to stall out the terrain to neutralize his strategy. His Electivire is fast and hits hard with Ice Punch, so be careful with your Ground type. A well rounded team will be able to succeed with the right approach.

Afterwards, you will make another choice that will affect the game! 

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to stop Sigmund after fighting him.**

Relationship Point Choices:
- Choose to stop Sigmund after fighting him (+1 Saphira, +1 Shelly, +1 Charlotte, +1 Noel, +1 Anna, +1 Shade, -1 Laura, -2 Sigmund)
- Choose to stop Sirius after fighting Sigmund (+1 Laura, -2 Saphira, -1 Noel)

If Saphira was abducted, you'll also see a hole in the wall that opens up. You can actually use the hole instead of the door to enter and exit.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Exit or enter the Belrose Manse through the hole in the wall (-1 Laura)

## Tanzan Meteor Base

With that, we can now enter the Tanzan Mountain and take back whoever you ended up getting kidnapped by Team Meteor.

Head into Tanzan Mountain and go to the right as soon as you can. Depending on your earlier choices either Laura or Saphira will be here. Talk to them and you will be able to use the rock to nicely remove the barrier or freely pass through it after Dragonite destroys it. 

The next room contains a hidden *Green Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, and *Blue Shard*. Enter the base. 

There will be a lot of these rotary thingies all over the base. Essentially they will send you 90 degrees in the indicated direction, but once you use it, it'll send you in the opposite direction next time. So, you'll only be able to go left for now. Head up and into the room. 

This next room has tiles that will teleport you to the same color equivalent in a different room - and those in that room will teleport you back. You'll need to reach the top of each room to deactivate a panel. To succeed, one strategy is this: 

Use the left panel, then go left, down, up, up and use the computer. Spam down and eventually you can return to the bottom of the room. Ensuring we are starting in the right room this time, use the right panel, then go right, down, up, up, and use this computer. Spam down, again use the white panels at the bottom to pop out in the right side, then head up via the rotator and go in.

Use this rotary to go left. Head into the room at the bottom to grab *PULSE Readout 7*. 

Enter the room to the left. If anyone except Saphira was abducted earlier, you can get relationship points here.

Relationship Point Choices:
- After Noel and Anna are abducted, talk to them in the cage (+2 Noel)
- After Charlotte and Shelly are abducted, talk to them in the cage (+1 Shelly, +1 Charlotte)
- After Laura is abducted, talk to her in the cage (+1 Laura)

Return to the previous room, then go up. There is only one path you can take for now, so beat the grunts and take it. You'll see a purple tile, step on it and you'll end up in the left side of the base again. Once more go up, this time, you'll be sent up. Go left onto the blue tile for now, then the rotary will send you down again. In the next room you'll go to the right this time. You'll get an *Exp. Candy L*!

Use the teleporter and you'll emerge on the right side of the area. Enter the room on the right, pick up the *Revive* at the bottom, then talk to Saphira. You'll have to fight two grunts.

Head back to the left and take the rotary to go up. Talk to the grunts and scientists up here and talk to the computers to open up the door at the top as well as a shortcut in the bottom-left corner. Talk to Simon here (he won't fight you) to start up a sidequest later.

Enter the door at the top!

## Tanzan Depths

If Saphira was abducted, you'll be here with Laura.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to Laura in the depths (+2 Laura)

Go out and head up. You'll see some dialogue. Head down from here, you'll see a new path open up. Continue this process until you have to participate in a battle!

Pokemon Gargantuan. Field: Rocky Field
- Steelix (Steelix-Mega), Lv. 75, @Sitrus Berry, Ability: Sand Force, Careful Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/4/0/0/0/252
    - Earthquake
    - Stone Edge
    - Crunch
    - Heavy Slam

Another single Pokemon boss, this time with a Mega Steelix. Since it's slow you can wear it down with Special moves. Counter also works well if you can take a hit. 

Relationship Point Choices:
- Beat Steelix on the first try (+3 Saphira, +1 Laura)
- Beat Steelix on the second, etc. try (+2 Saphira)

Tanzan Depths

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Onix              |20 |
|Geodude           |20 |
|**Sandslash**     |14 |
|Graveler          |10 |
|Diglett           |10 |
|Arbok             |10 |
|**Hippopotas**    |6  |
|**Dugtrio**       |5  |
|**Durant**        |5  |

Once you emerge, make your way back into the base and head to the back room. Once you do it will be time for another fight! 

Meteor Admin ZEL. Field: Factory Field
- PULSE Abra, Lv. 75, @Silk Scarf, Ability: Magic Guard, Modest Nature, IVs: 31. Stat Spread: 25/20/115/140/195/155. Typing: Psychic/Steel
    - Hyper Beam
    - Dark Pulse
    - Hyper Beam
    - Hyper Beam

Seriously. Of course, when you're only fighting one Pokemon with very low HP that has to deal with recharge much of the time, it shouldn't be too hard. Disabling Dark pulse will let your Ghost sit there for free, Mirror Coat and Metal Burst can work great here, etc. There's lots of options for this PULSE. 

Head all the way back to Tanzan Cove and talk to Anna inside. It's time for another gym battle!

## Standard Badge

Prodigy Noel (3x Hyper Potion). Field: Grassy Terrain
- Cinccino, Lv. 54, @King's Rock, Ability: Skill Link, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Tail Slap
    - U-turn
    - Rock Blast
    - Bullet Seed
- Porygon-Z, Lv. 54, @Elemental Seed, Ability: Download, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Nasty Plot
    - Psychic
    - Hidden Power
    - Tri Attack
- Bewear, Lv. 54, @Muscle Band, Ability: Fluffy, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Hammer Arm
    - Zen Headbutt
    - Stomp Tantrum
    - Ice Punch
- Girafarig, Lv. 54, @Twisted Spoon, Ability: Sap Sipper, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Psychic
    - Thunderbolt
    - Thunder Wave
    - Hidden Power
- Swellow, Lv. 54, @Flame Orb, Ability: Guts, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - U-turn
    - Brave Bird
    - Steel Wing
    - Facade
- Clefable, Lv. 55, @Elemental Seed, Ability: Magic Guard, Calm Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/204/0/52/0
    - Moonblast
    - Calm Mind
    - Soft-Boiled
    - Stored Power

Shocker, another tough gym leader in Pokemon Reborn. You'll notice that Noel uses Normal types on a field that doesn't really benefit most of his moves, instead, he'll mainly profit off of the free healing each turn. His seeded Clefable, Girafarig, and Bewear in particular are all fairly bulky and have good coverage to mess up your team. With the addition of a Porygon-Z who gets extra bulk thanks to its seed and hits like a truck and the demon spawn known as King's Rock Cinccino, you're in for a tough fight against a well-rounded Normal-type team (ok, 5/6ths of a Normal-type team plus Clefable).

Clefable's Magic Guard is an annoying ability that means you need to overwhelm it physically despite its seed boost or get it before it can Calm Mind too much, but thankfully it means it doesn't have Unaware. This means you can get your own sweeper set up potentially against Bewear or Girafarig and maybe steamroll his team. Fighting types can potentially destroy the Cinccino but won't see a ton of success against the rest of the team. Since Normal-types have no other weaknesses, you might have to turn to using the field to your benefit. Although Girafarig has Sap Sipper to absorb Grass-type moves, you can go with a hyper-offensive Grass-type strategy, keeping Swellow in mind. Coil and Growth are boosted on this field, so it shouldn't be impossible to set up. You can also take advantage of the boost to Fire-moves - in particular Bewear will get crushed by them. Keep in mind too that the Elemental Seed can potentially allow you to more easily survive Cinccino and/or get your own tank set up. 

In a pinch, this fight becomes much easier if you change the field to the Burning Field or the Corrosive Field. However Laura doesn't like you destroying her flower garden!

Relationship Point Choices:
- Beat Noel on Burning Field (-2 Laura)
- Beat Noel on Corrosive Field (-1 Laura)

For winning, you'll get the *Standard Badge* which boosts our cap to 60. We'll also get *TM10 Hidden Power*! 

# Into Darkness

Back inside, talk to the crew here, then Noel in the stairs room. You'll hear a non-Julia boom, indicating it's time to return to Tanzan Mountain once more.
