    <h1>Pokemon Reborn Walkthrough</h1>
    I began work on the Pokemon Reborn walkthrough began shortly after the release of Episode 19 of the game back in 2022. The walkthrough details everything you need to know in order to complete <strong>100%</strong> of the game's content, including full trainer battle details, item locations, Pokemon locations, quest instructions and screenshots, and more. This walkthrough is currently <strong> completely up to date </strong> with the current 19.5 beta version.

    <h1>Pokemon Rejuvenation Walkthrough</h1>
    I began work on the Pokemon Rejuvenation walkthrough all the way back in 2018 during the game's V9 version. Originally a 400+ page Google Document, the walkthrough has gone through six years of evolution alongside my skills as a developer. It currently covers 100% of the game material <em> through version V13</em>. This walkthrough is <strong> not currently up-to-date with the V13.5 version </strong> though updates are planned for when the game updates to V14.
