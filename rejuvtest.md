# Chapter 1: Shipwrecked

## Prologue - Prolog

To start, the “M” key toggles a speed-up of the game. The game will
start off asking if you want to skip the prologue. Rejuvenation is a
very story-focused game, so I recommend viewing it if it is your first
time playing. If you do skip the prologue, jump ahead to the next
section.

As soon as you’re done reading the Zorua and Pangoro story, take control
of Maria and head downstairs to talk to Mom. Afterwards enter the bottom
room on the left side of the first floor and head downstairs and
interact with the summoning table.

Head back upstairs and talk to Dad in the top-left room. Then return to
the kitchen to talk to Mom. After that go upstairs. After a brief flash
and the sound of breaking glass, go back downstairs and talk with the
mysterious figure. Head west back down to the basement to watch the
cutscene.

After regaining control of Marianette, head down, east, and up through
the hallway and watch the final cutscene of the prologue play out.

## S.S. Oceana - Oceana1

After either skipping the prologue or finishing the last cutscene, the
game asks which difficulty mode you’d prefer. Personally, I would
recommend Casual Mode for anyone attempting to do a more restrictive
challenge run or anyone who does not have much experience with the
Reborn-style Pokémon game. I would recommend Normal Mode to anyone
looking for a challenge or who found Reborn’s difficulty adequate, and
Intense Mode to those with lots of experience who found Normal / Reborn
too easy, somehow. Regardless of choice, the game allows you to change
your difficulty setting later if you want. **I will be covering battles
in this guide as they appear in Normal Mode.**

Register yourself as a trainer, choosing among genders and six sprites.
Amanda will ask if you want to input a password. I don’t recommend using
the password if you’ve never played the game, since this section
contains many important story beats, but if you do want to skip ahead to
the next section, the password is 4567, though you’ll lose out on
potential relationship points with Nancy.

There are two other passwords you can input here. If you want to play as
a legacy protagonist sprite, type 1111. If you want to play the game as
a certain side quest character from later (Ana), type 9494.

Exit the first room and talk to Nancy. This is the first of instances
that get you relationship points with characters - which affect how they
view you. Thanks to Punch for collecting the information about these.
Any dialogue options which are not listed do not affect relationship
points. (Search “Relationship Point” to see them all)

Relationship Point Choices:
- I’m fine. (Mom +2)
- ... (Mom -1)

Once you’ve talked to Nancy and can roam, explore the S.S. Oceana. In
this game talking to everyone and everything you see can be vital to
discovering new Pokémon and Items, so it's a good idea to talk to
everyone aboard.

Heading to the stairs on the left, in the two rooms you can enter on the
left side, there are two notches in the wall. Interacting with them, you
can listen in on two conversations: one with unknown figures and the
other including Nancy.

Head up the stairs three times to the right to talk to Cpt. Augustus.
He’ll explain a few of Rejuvenation’s mechanics. Head downstairs and
enter the double doors to the upper middle room. Talk to Nancy to get
the banquet started, when you’re ready.

Once you regain control, follow the path and watch the events play out.

## Oceana Pier - OPier1

After either skipping the boat scenes or watching the cutscenes, talk to
Tesla. Once you regain control, you can explore Oceana Pier.

Now is a good time to change some of your options. I recommend doing
Text Speed: Max and Battle Scene: Off if you want the game to go
quickly. For a bit more challenge, you can also change the battle mode
to “Set.” I also recommend storing at least a few backups -- save files
can get corrupted.

Anyways, if you want to talk to the woman on the northeast pier, you can
get an all-expenses paid trip to Hoenn, but it is a game over.
Otherwise, there’s not too much to do here yet, so head into the gate on
the north side.

## Gearen Laboratory - GearLab1

The trainers won’t let you head west or east quite yet, so head into the
building north.

The guy running in place on the left will offer to give you cinematic
bars during important cutscenes if you want. Talk to the girl behind the
counter to buy some basic products:

<u>Gearen Lab Shop</u>:

|Item|Price|
|---|---|
|*Poke Ball*|$200|
|*Potion*|$300|
|*Repel*|$350|
|*Antidote*|$100|

You start with $1,500. I recommend picking up at least a few Poke balls
to catch some team members soon, as a full team is almost necessary to
succeed in Rejuvenation, even as early as the first gym battle of this
game.

Talk to Amanda at the top of the building to see a brief cutscene, then
head up towards the door to meet Melia. Go through the door to meet
Professor Jenner. You’ll then get to pick a starter Pokémon by
interacting with it. If you talk to the rainbow-colored machine on the
right side, it will randomly choose for you among the 24 starters.

<u>Starter Choices (Pick ONE)</u>:

- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**
- **Grookey**
- **Scorbunny**
- **Sobble**

As in Reborn, Speed Boost Torchic is arguably the strongest choice --
but all the starters can be useful in their own ways. The first gym
specializes in Poison, so the Grass-type starters may be difficult to
use at first. Choose whatever you want though!

You can quick save with ‘D’ in front of the Pokémon you choose and use
‘F12’ to soft reset for natures, IV’s, shininess, and abilities. All
Pokémon in this game have a chance at hidden abilities and the shiny
rate is increased to a little over 1/100.

Anyways, once you’ve picked your starter, head west for a battle with
Aevium Scout Amanda! You can win or lose this battle.

<u>League Scout Amanda (No Field)</u>

-   Hatenna, Level 5.
    -   Tackle
    -   Play Nice

Note that in this game you can press “S” to check the stats of all the
Pokemon, as well as the weather / field / move effects in play to aid
you in your fights. After the battle, she’ll give you *5 Poke Balls.*
Head to talk to Jenner and you’ll fight:

<u>Pokemon Trainer Ren (No Field)</u>

-   Froakie, Level 5.
    -   Pound
    -   Growl

After the fight with Ren, Jenner asks you to visit Route 1 to help
Melia. He then gives you the *Pokedex* and the *Cybernav!* Head back
downstairs and listen to Jan’s tutorial.

The EV training center can be accessed by talking to the woman on the
right of the counter, but none of its training rooms are open right now.

When you’re ready, head back outside to start exploring East Gearen
City!

## Left East Gearen City - EGear1

This guide will not cover every NPC trainer, but know that as you
explore Aevium there are many!

Patches of grass around Gearen City have opened, so consider catching
some Pokémon to assist your starter.

<u>Left East Gearen City</u>

| Grass: Morning        | %        |Grass: Day         | %        | Grass: Night    | %        |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|----------------------|----------|
| **Rattata (Alolan)**  | 30       | **Bidoof**        | 30       | **Rattata (Alolan)** | 30       |
| **Wurmple**           | 25       | **Wurmple**       | 25       | **Wurmple**          | 25       |
| **Pidgey**            | 15       | **Pidove**        | 15       | **Poochyena**        | 15       |
| **Patrat**            | 15       | **Patrat**        | 15       | **Hoothoot**         | 15       |
| **Bellsprout**        | 10       | **Bellsprout**    | 10       | **Oddish**           | 10       |
| **Sunkern**           | 5        | **Sunkern**       | 5        | **Chingling**        | 5        |

Chingling can help in the fight against the gym dramatically, especially
if you manage to evolve it. However, it is rare-ish here and can be
found much more reliably later.

If you go west on the bottom street, you can find a GourmetTreat in a
bush. We’ll want some of these later to get event Pokémon.

If you talk to the nerd on the east side of the bottom street, he’ll
give you *Reverse Candy.* The tile to the left of the rightmost tree on
this street has a hidden *Oran Berry* in it. Another *Oran Berry* can be
found immediately below the machine thing on the right street, above
Lacey.

If you go up to the north, left, and down, you can find an *Elemental
Seed* one tile above the left of two trees. There is also a *Resist
Wing* in the grass four spaces to the right.

Heading up to the park, you can find a *Grass Gem* one tile left of the
rightmost bench in the park. Sneaking around the wall to the right,
there is a *Blue Shard* in the side of the building, and on the other
side, an *Escape Rope* in the wall. The tile one down and one right from
the bottom right edge of the fountain has another *Grass Gem*, and
straight to the left the third tile from the edge of the park holds a
*Super Repel.*

You can find a *GourmetTreat* in the wall between two dumpsters on the
north side of the city up one set of stairs, and *Yellow Shard* on the
ground between the two dumpsters to the left of those. Another *Yellow
Shard* is in the rightmost dumpster up another set of stairs.

Head out to the Oceana Pier. You’ll find a **Nidoran M** eating. Talk to
it with a GourmetTreat for a battle.

The garden to the south is also now open, so you can catch level 5
**Fletchling** here by interacting with them. If you’re interested in
winning even the “impossible” story battles, make sure you catch two,
for their Quick Guard move will help us win one later. The bottom right
grass tile here has a *Sweet Heart,* and there is an *X Accuracy* two
tiles left and one up from there.

Head into the building on the west side that’s now unlocked. Talk to the
“man” with the yellow hair, then exit the building and watch Buizel run
by. This starts a quest we’ll complete later.

Back in East Gearen, to the left of the lab is the Velvet Building. In
each of the buildings, people will challenge you to battles, so be
warned. Head up to the first floor and talk to the woman in the middle.
If you choose left, she’ll give you a *Mineral Ball,* and *Steam Ball*
if you choose right. Also grab the *Great Ball* in the bottom left. If
you enter the second floor, you’ll see a **Pachirisu** running wild. If
you give it a GourmetTreat, it’ll battle you. There is also a *Potion*
in the corner. Grab the *Exp. Candy XS* on the third floor.

Now go to the Emerald Building on the northeast side of town. Talk to a
girl on the left side to learn about the mystery of the third floor.
You’ll need to beat a trainer to access the upper levels. On the second
floor pick up a *Red Shard* in the corner. Talk to a red-haired girl for
a *Full Heal*, and get a *Super Repel* from an old woman. Enter the
third floor to battle a level 5 **Shuppet**.

If you enter the Magnolia Library on the north side of town and pay $300
you can enter the back side of the library. By talking to the man in
glasses you can use the shards hidden around the map for tutor moves.
These aren’t very useful, but you can get them for your Pokémon if you
want to.

<u>Library Move Tutor</u>

|Move|Price|
|---|---|
|Bind |1 Red Shard|
|Covet |1 Blue Shard|
|Helping Hand |1 Yellow Shard|

The building on the left of the library is the Gearen Help Center. We’ll
be returning here later.

After doing all this you may be strong enough to complete the final
quest of this area for now. If you try to cross into the northwest side
of the city, a thug will force you to pay $300 or to battle him. He uses
two Level 12-13 Pokémon, so be sure you’re ready. When you win you can
access the northwest area! (+1 Karma, a way for the game to track how
much you help people)

Two tiles up and two tiles right of the grandma on the bench is a hidden
*Red Shard.* Three down and three left of the cop in the top left is a
*Super Potion.*

You can interact with a Nidoran in this map. Follow it to these
locations:

1. First encounter -- northeast by Emerald building.

2. Northwest by train station.

3. East side of the city near bridge, next to dumpster

4. North side, south of library near some dumpsters

After this encounter you can interact with it and battle it. **Nidoran
F** is at level 5.

## Right East Gearen City - EGear2

You’ll see grass around this part of the city too, with more Pokémon.

<u>Right East Gearen City</u>

| Grass: Morning        | %        | Grass: Day        | %        | Grass: Night        | %        |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|----------|
| Rattata (Alolan)      | 30       | Bidoof            | 30       | Rattata (Alolan)    | 30       |
| **Paras**             | 28       | **Paras**         | 28       | **Jigglypuff**      | 28       |
| Patrat                | 25       | Patrat            | 25       | Poochyena           | 25       |
| Pidgey                | 15       | Pidove            | 15       | Hoothoot            | 15       |
| **Klink**             | 2        | **Klink**         | 2        | **Klink**           | 2        |

Catch a Female Jigglypuff to breed later.

Heading straight up from the entrance, to the left of the machine in the
grass is a hidden *Super Repel,* and the bottom right tile in this
grassy area contains a *Poke Ball.* The bush to the right has a hidden
*Resist Wing.*

To the east, you’ll see a *Super Potion* near a tent. Here you’ll meet
Mr. Luck -- this is how you change your difficulty, as I mentioned
earlier.

Down and to the left is a machine, one tile up there is a hidden
*Potion.*

The center of the map has a row of shops. I usually sell the Resist
Wings here to get some cash. Here’s where you get more GourmetTreats if
you run out. We aren’t going to need any Reverse Candies in this game
beyond the ones we find since the level cap is a hard cap unless you use
Rare Candies to go over it.

<u>East Gearen Market Shop: Top Left Vendor</u>

|Item           |Price      |   
| ---           | ---       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*GourmetTreat* |$1500      |
|*Repel*        |$350       |
|*Reverse Candy*|$50        |

<u>East Gearen Market Shop: Bottom Left Vendor</u>

|Item           |Price      |   
| ---           | ---       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Ice Heal*     |$250       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Awakening*    |$250       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |

<u>East Gearen Market Shop: Bottom-right Vendor (Only available Weekdays,
during the daytime)</u>

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Reverse Candy*|$50        |
|*Soda Pop*     |$300       |

If you talk to the vendor on the top right, he’ll attempt to sell you
Poke Ball’s at $400 each. While this may seem like a rip-off, once you
buy four, he’ll give you a **Voltorb!**

If you enter the Shopping Emporium above the market vendors, there are a
few shops open for business.

<u>Berry Emporium Shop</u>

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Oran Berry*---|$200       |
|*Pecha Berry*  |$300       |

You can pick up a few of each berry for the gym.

<u>Poke Ball Emporium Shop</u>

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Heavy Ball*   |$300       |
|*Moon Ball*    |$300       |

The Heavy Ball won’t be too useful for the beginning portion of the
game. If you haven’t captured Jigglypuff or done the Nidoran events,
Moon Balls can be extra useful, but the cheaper, normal balls also 
work fine. The right vendor is currently not in business due to an 
unfulfilled help quest, which we’ll get to later.

Heading down a street, three tiles east and one down from the bicycle
shop door you’ll find a *Pretty Wing.* In a park to the right, two tiles
left of a skinny tree is a hidden *Repel.* Heading east from here, in
the upper right patch in the grass under some train tracks you’ll find
an *Antidote,* and five tiles to the east of the corner of blue liquid
below you, in the street, is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

On the southeast point of the city, if you go west past Karrina, you can
find a *Reverse Candy* hiding in the shade of the tree.

Along the east side of the city, you should see Buizel. His trainer will
show up. Win the battle, and **Buizel** is yours!

North from here, grab an *Iron.* Again, I recommend selling it as $4900
is a lot of money at this point in the game. Down and left from here,
from the bottom end of the blue liquid, five tiles left is a hidden
*Revive.*

Go up towards the Chrisola Resort in the northeast corner of town. Head
east as you get up the stairs and follow the path to get *TM83:
Infestation.* The two flower pots on either side of the door have hidden
*Paralyze Heal* and *Green Shard.*

## Chrisola Resort - CResor1

Enter the Chrisola Hotel Resort at the top of the map. Entering gives us
a Relationship Point (Saki +1).

After you regain control, talk to a man in the bottom right for a *Super
Potion.* Enter the right hallway and go past the first two rooms and
into the first on the upper side to get *TM126 Whirlpool.* In the
hallway on the left, head into the open room at the top and interact
with the tile down and right from the top left plant for $1,500!

Head to the Casino level and talk to the red-haired fellow. They’ll
flush their Coin Case down the drain so we can pick it up later.

You’ve probably noticed a few popups regarding achievements thus far --
complete them and you’ll earn AP, redeemable here. For now, we probably
can’t get much but I recommend saving up for the HM Items as they’ll
make your life a lot easier. The card items will allow you access to EV
Training rooms in Jenner’s lab, so those are nice too. The Exp. All
isn’t that necessary anymore in this game since there are lots of
grinding options available. Anyways, talk to the girl on the right side
to get an *Achievement Card.*

<u>AP Shop</u>

*Adamant Mint* 3 AP

*Jolly Mint* 3 AP

*Brave Mint* 3 AP

*Timid Mint* 3 AP

*Modest Mint* 3 AP

*Quiet Mint* 3 AP

*Calm Mint* 3 AP

*Bold Mint* 3 AP

*PP Up* 6 AP

*Golden Axe* 10 AP

*Golden Hammer* 10 AP

*Golden Surfboard* 15 AP

*Golden Gauntlet* 15 AP

*Golden Scuba Gear* 15 AP

*Golden Wings* 20 AP

*Golden Jetpack* 20 AP

*Golden Drift Board* 20 AP

*Golden Claws* 20 AP

*Exp. All* 30 AP

*HP Card* 10 AP

*Atk Card* 10 AP

*Def Card* 10 AP

*Speed Card* 10 AP

*Sp. Atk Card* 10 AP

*Sp. Def Card* 10 AP

I wouldn’t recommend buying any of the first nine items until you get
everything else. Golden Items allow us to use HM’s without needing a
Pokémon in the party that has learned them. The Cards allow us to access
EV training rooms. Exp. All is very helpful for grinding, but with the
grinders and Exp. Candies, it may not be the most useful thing for its
high price yet. The cards let you into the basement of the Gearen lab to
do rapid EV training. When you do get access to each EV room, inside
you’ll find the respective Power item: *Power Anklet, Power Band, Power
Belt, Power Bracer, Power Lens, Power Weight.*

When I play, I tend to buy the Golden Hammer first, then begin
collecting the Cards. I’ll buy the Golden Axe as soon as I get Cut, then
finish with AP cards. Then I’ll buy the rest of the Golden Items as I
need them, and the Exp. All when I have enough AP.

Head up to the top floor of the building, Rooftop. There is an Audino
breeder up here: every time you beat them, you will get 3 *Exp. Candy
S.* Combined with the hard level cap, these breeders make level
management in this game a breeze!

Three tiles down and two to the right from the lamppost two to the left
of the breeder is a hidden *Oran Berry.* Two lampposts down from the
breeder, there is a hidden *Resist Wing* four tiles right and one up.
Finally, from the right set of stairs to the helipad two tiles down and
one right has a hidden *Reverse Candy.*

There are Pokémon to encounter here.

Chrisola Rooftop

| Bellsprout                | 2        | Oddish              | 2        |

Once you’re done, head back outside. Enter the Aqua Building to the
southwest. On the first floor, pick up the *Old Rod*, as well as another
*Iron*! If you attempt to go to the third floor, you’ll enter a really
impossible battle (Level 80!) given the tools we have now. I don’t
recommend this unless you have the money and self-respect to spare.

## Gearen Park - GPark1

Head to the bottom part of this area.

You can find a *Heart Scale* in the wall between two trees on the left.
Two tiles right of the rightmost purple flower is a *TinyMushroom.*
Enter Gearen Park below.

Gearen Park (Grassy Terrain)

|                       |          |                   |          |                     |          |

The first tile below the really tall grass in the second column on the
left of really tall grass has a hidden *Honey.* Straight down, another
*Honey* is three tiles up from the bottom flower. In the left tile of
the tree straight left from the bench here, you’ll find a *Carbos.* On
the right side of the park, there is a hidden *Rare Candy* in the second
empty spot among really tall grass from the bottom. Up from here in
between a square of 7 tall grass and a purple flower is a *Blue Shard*,
and 4 tiles up and 2 left is a *Muscle Wing.* Finally in the concrete on
the bottom, in the center two tiles up from the bottom, is a *Yellow
Shard.*

## Sewers Visit 1 - Sewer1

To progress the story, head east into Venam’s front yard, down from here
a bit, and see a cutscene. Head to the Emporium to get a *Pecha Berry?*
from the attendant. Give it to Venam.

Choices:

- All me. (Venam +2)

- Maybe… (Venam +1)

- No, actually. (Neutral)

Head to the southeast of town and a cutscene will play. Afterwards
follow Venam into the sewers. You’ll be teaming up with Ren here, who
will heal your Pokémon after every battle. Additionally, if you try to
catch Pokémon while with Ren, you’ll need to knock one of the two out in
order to catch the other, which can be frustrating.

Anyways, there are lots of new Pokémon here:

Abandoned Sewers

| <u>Cave:</u>     | <u>%</u> | <u>Old Rod</u> | <u>%</u> |

| **Geodude**      | 1        |                |          |

Head left, and on the second tile from left at the bottom is a hidden
*Poison Gem.* Head across the bridge and right to get a *Great Ball.* Go
up and before crossing the bridge, there is a hidden *Zinc* in the
bottom right corner. Talk to a bug catcher to get a *Pecha Berry.* To
the right is a *Bold Mint.* Above the girl to the left is a hidden
*Potion* and in the thing to the right is another *Potion.*

Heading back down and crossing to the left, if the guy flushed it at the
Hotel, go left and all the way down to grab the *Coin Case!* The corner
to the right and down has a hidden *Reverse Candy.*

Attempt to enter the room Venam runs into and it will lock you out.
There’s an *Antidote* to the left.

Head back across the bridge, up and left to the generator room. Start
the third, first, then second generator. Go back into the room Venam
went into for a long cutscene and a battle.

<u>Garbodor Garbage Crew (No field)</u>

-   Trubbish, Level 11.

    -   Pound

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Recycle

    -   Tackle

-   Trubbish, Level 12.

    -   Pound

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Recycle

    -   Tackle

-   Garbodor, Level 13.

    -   Pound

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Toxic Spikes

Knocking out the Trubbish makes this a two-on-one. Any of your new
Poison-types should be able to resist getting poisoned here, but really
any strong STAB moves can take out the Trubbish. Ren’s Growlithe hits
hard with Ember, plus he has two more in the back, so you shouldn’t
really have to worry here.

## Game Corner Prizes - GCorner1

Now’s a good time to mention all the prizes available in the game
corner. While you can get them all right now with enough patience, it’s
not necessary to grab everything right now.

Anyways, there’s a grand total of 120 coins along the ground in there,
try to find them all. Otherwise, here’s what you can get here:

<u>Coin Vendor</u>

50 Coins $1,000

500 Coins $10,000

<u>Left Vendor</u>

*TM70 Flash* 1000 Coins

*TM10 Hidden Power* 5000 Coins

<u>Right Vendor</u>

**Seel** 1000 Coins

**Spoink** 4000 Coins

**Maractus** 5000 Coins

**Helioptile** 6500 Coins

To get coins you can buy them or play the various games in the casino.
Of these, Voltorb Flip is easily the most efficient once you know what
you’re doing... but with the luck involved it will take quite a while
still. I recommend getting Spoink for the gym and Hidden Power in order
to spice up your early game movesets, but it’s up to you.

The attendant on the left is the lotto corner lady, who’ll pick one
number a day and check if it matches your Pokémon’s, like in the
official games. The prizes are as follows:

<u>Lotto Attendant</u>

*Master Ball* 5 Matches

*Max Revive* 4 Matches

*Exp. Share* 3 Matches

*PP Up* 2 Matches

*Ultra Ball* 1 Matches

Anyways, once you’ve gambled to your heart’s content, there is a bit
more optional stuff to do if you want.

In Gearen Park, talk to Melia for an optional scene for Relationship
Points (Melia +3).

Relationship Point Choices:

- You like photography? (Melia +1)

- What are you doing? (Neutral)

Relationship Point Choices:

- I love photography! (Melia +2)

- I appreciate the art! (Melia +1)

- It's not for me. (Neutral)

- Photography's boring. (Melia -2)

Additionally, head back to Magnolia Library, and for a short time you’ll
be able to battle Ren -- it’s optional experience and money should you
want it.

## PoisonHeart Badge - Badge01 

It’s time to take on Venam’s gym in East Gearen. This gym will require
us to mix colors to make composite colors.

Take out the first trainer and learn the color combination we need to
build is Magenta. To mix magenta, add red and blue.

In the second room, we’re going to make orange and green. Do red and
yellow first, then check the machine. Then do teal and yellow to make
green and move into the third room.

The trainer in the next room will tell you to make Orange, White, and
Teal.

The first is red + yellow, and the second is green + red + blue.
Finally, add just green + blue and we’re in.

Well, that would be all we have to do, but there’s a secret. If you mix
brown, then white, then orange, you’ll get access to a secret area. A
fun fact: the Seviper and Venipede boarded up gyms are versions of
Venam’s gym from older versions of Rejuvenation!

After emerging, two tiles to the left of the top dumpster is a hidden
*Psychic Gem.* Up the stairs all the way left is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

In the upper left corner here, you can find a hidden *Rare Candy!* One
tile down and 4 right is a hidden *Red Shard.* Here too is a **Seviper**
Egg as well as a *Fresh Water* hidden 4 tiles right of it.

Gearen Alleyway

|              |          |
|--------------|----------|
| <u>Grass</u> | <u>%</u> |
| **Sentret**  | 30       |
| Poochyena    | 20       |

| Pidgey       | 5        |
| Patrat       | 4        |

Well, that’s about it for that area, so clear your team, equip all the
good items you can take advantage of (Oran and Pecha Berries work well
here), and save.

<u>Punk Girl Venam (Corrosive Field)</u>

Venam's Kiss: Poison \| Physical \| 75 power \| 100% accuracy \| 10%
chance to poison, super-effective against Steel-types.

Honestly, this one isn’t too bad. If you’ve picked up Chingling or
Spoink, they can wreck the house here. Marshtomp, my starter, helped as
well, though Mud Shot gains Poison typing on the field. Ultimately this
is not too bad and if you’re really struggling with an under leveled
team you can push them to the Lv. 18 cap and win by sheer stat
advantage.

After the battle, you’ll be rewarded with the *PoisonHeart Badge*!
She’ll also give you *TM102 Poison Sweep!* This is a new move that can
be useful in the early game.

## Post-Gym Quests - EGear3

Some quests have opened, everything in this section is optional though.

Return to Gearen Lab. The girl by the PC will gift you an **Aevian
Feebas** from Jan! How nice of him.

Head to the Magnolia Library. Talk to the guard of the stairs to the
right. As you have a badge, she’ll let you pass.

Upstairs, you’ll find a Black Belt who will offer to teach more tutor
moves for shards.

<u>Library 2F Move Tutor</u>

Dual Chop 2 Yellow Shards

Block 2 Blue Shards

Super Fang 2 Red Shards

Of these, Super Fang can be useful for catching Pokémon, and Dual Chop
can give you coverage against Dragon types if you really need it.

Talk to the girl on the right. This is Zumi, and she’ll start us on a
Pokedex collection quest. We’ll be back once we catch a Dedenne for her.

Head into Venam’s house south of the hotel. If you head upstairs, you’ll
find a *Poison Barb.*

Back in Gearen Park, now you’ll be able to give a treat to
**Gossifleur** for a battle!

Head back to Gearen Lab and talk to the girl sitting by the computer on
the left. Now that we have a badge, she’ll ask for some help with an
online fangame league. She’ll then give you a *Badge Card.* Talk to her
again and agree to help.

Your first battle is against Falkner.

<u>Gym Leader Falkner (Glitch Field)</u>

-   Hoothoot, Level 11.

    -   Confusion

    -   Peck

    -   Hypnosis

-   Noctowl, Level 12.

    -   Confusion

    -   Peck

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Echoed Voice

I am using Cyndaquil and Onix. Use Ember and Rock Tomb and you should
come out on top. If you win, you’ll get a *Virtual Badge.* That’s all
she needs for now, we’ll come back after we have two badges.

One shop has updated inventory now that we have a badge. Head to the
Shopping Emporium.

<u>Poke Ball Emporium New Items (1 Badge)</u>

*Love Ball* $300

*Fast Ball* $300

Love Balls are a very useful ball for their price, just pay attention to
the gender of what you’re trying to catch.

Now’s a good time to start taking on the Help Center quests, so head
into the help center. You’ll be approached by Ayuda, who’ll give you a
quest to collect Zygarde cells. He’ll give you the *Gather Cube* to
begin this quest. We will finish the help quests first, then get the
cells.

<u>HQuest 1: Help Starly</u>

-   Start at Gearen Lab. Talk to the black-haired girl next to Nurse Joy

## Route 1 and Goldenwood Forest - Rt1GF1

Once you’re ready to leave, head to the northwest part of town and enter
the train station. Inside the station, you’ll meet up with Tesla, who’ll
buy you a ticket and give you *Potions.* Talk to the grandfather in the
station and agree to help him, then board the train. Battles at Route 1
are on the Golden Forest field.

Route 1 (Forest Field)

The tree to the left of the second red flower from the train has a
hidden *Potion.* Grab the *Super Repel* and the *Jolly Mint* above.

You’ll see a **Whismur** nearby. If you give it a GourmetTreat, it’ll
battle you!

ZCell 005: Route 1

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image5.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.02083in" />

Head north and enjoy a great cutscene montage with Melia. Once you
regain control, interact with Drifblim.

Relationship Point Choices:

- It was no bother! (Narcissa +1)

- It was a complete bother. (Narcissa -1)

You’ll get an *HP Up.* Another free $4900! Grab the nearby *Potion* as
well and talk to the Furfrou lady for another *Potion.*

Goldenwood Forest (Forest Field)

| Furret       | 1        |                |          |

There are some trainers south to battle. When you’re ready, head north
into Goldenwood Cave.

Melia will join your party here.

Goldenwood Cave (Cave Field)

|             |          |
|-------------|----------|
| <u>Cave</u> | <u>%</u> |
| Geodude     | 49       |
| Noibat      | 34       |
| **Woobat**  | 15       |
| Furret      | 2        |

Woobat is good for the next gym.

To the right, one of the rocks contains a hidden *Red Shard.* The tile
right of a skinny tree above the steps has a *TinyMushroom,* and the top
left rock as you head down the left stairs has a *Blue Shard.* The top
left rock in the area past the bridge hides a *Potion,* and if you head
up to the top area on the right, one tile down and three right of the
skinny tree is a *TinyMushroom,* while another *TinyMushroom* is a tile
left of the top of two red flowers on the right. Heading back to the
top, the rock below Leavanny has a *Great Ball.* If you can, do the
optional battle against Mars here.

<u>Culvier Clan Mars</u>

-   Sewaddle, Level 15. @ Light Clay.

    -   Return

    -   Bug Bite

    -   Seed Bomb

    -   Light Screen

-   Swadloon, Level 18. @ Miracle Seed.

    -   Return

    -   Iron Defense

    -   Seed Bomb

    -   Double Team

-   Leavanny, Level 20. @ Leftovers.

    -   Return

    -   Seed Bomb

    -   Synthesis

    -   Iron Defense

Fire and Flying moves obviously work great here if you can stall out the
Light Screen and/or avoid Iron Defense bulk. If you do manage to
succeed, you’ll get a *Star Shard* and a **Sewaddle**!

If you follow Melia, you’ll appear in a small room. Interact with the
rock at the top for a *PP Up!* I don’t recommend using this on your weak
moves just yet, either save it or sell it for $4900.

Make sure you’ve caught everything you care to in the whole Goldenwood
Forest/Cave area, as we won’t be able to come back for a little while.

Anyways, heal your team and talk to Melia.

Relationship Point Choices:

- I will cherish it too! (Melia +5)

- It was a good time. (Melia +2)

- it was okay, I guess. (Melia -1)

She’ll then challenge you to a battle.

<u>Pre-Leader Melia (Golden Forest field)</u>

-   Buneary, Level 15.

    -   Fake Out

    -   Double Hit

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Baby Doll Eyes

-   Wooloo, Level 15.

    -   Double Kick

    -   Tackle

    -   Defense Curl

    -   Copycat

-   Stufful, Level 14.

    -   Tackle

    -   Leer

    -   Roar

    -   Brutal Swing

-   Togepi, Level 15. @Oran Berry.

    -   Ancient Power

    -   Echoed Voice

    -   Yawn

    -   Metronome

Your second-stage starter should be able to make short work of it,
especially paired with Geodude who resists nearly all her attacks, or
Nidorina, who can hit hard with Double Kick. Just be careful to not let
Togepi buff itself up with Ancientpower too many times and you can make
it through.

## Goldenwood Xen Attack - GWXen1

As soon as Melia leaves, head back out through Goldenwood Cave. In the
briefcase, enter 3845 for an *Ability Capsule.* In this game you can
choose from any ability a Pokemon has. Then enter 6489. You’ll get the
*Snag Machine* and *10 Poke Balls!* Just like in Colosseum and XD, all
you must do is use Poke Balls on opponents’ Shadow Pokémon to catch
them. Go ahead and catch the first grunt’s Shadow Meowth**.**

Pair up with Melia and head south. Fight the west grunt to capture
Shadow Finneon**.** Melia won’t battle with you but will heal your
Pokémon if you talk to her. A grunt towards the bottom side of the lake
will have a Shadow **Cacnea.** Head to the bottom part of the lake when
you’re ready.

<u>Team Xen Eli and Sharon (Golden Forest Field)</u>

-   Murkrow, Level 16.

    -   Wing Attack

    -   Pursuit

    -   Confuse Ray

    -   Haze

-   Misdreavus, Level 16.

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Psywave

    -   Spite

    -   Growl

-   Glameow, Level 15.

    -   Feint Attack

    -   Scratch

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Attract

-   Stunky, Level 15.

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Smokescreen

    -   Fury Swipes

    -   Bite

A weak early game team, but you’ll have to get used to the doubles
format present in much of Rejuvenation. Murkrow is the hardest hitter,
while you’ll have to be careful about the status spreading from Glameow
and Stunky.

<u>Team Xen Zetta (Golden Forest Field)</u>

-   Shadow **Snorunt** Level 14.

-   Minior, Level 15.

    -   Rollout

    -   Defense Curl

    -   Confuse Ray

    -   Self-Destruct

-   Quilava, Level 15.

    -   Flame Wheel

    -   Quick Attack

    -   Aerial Ace

    -   Smokescreen

-   Type: Null, Level 18.

    -   Pursuit

    -   Double Hit

    -   Hidden Power: Fighting

    -   Aerial Ace

-   Galarian Meowth, Level 16.

    -   Metal Claw

    -   Pay Day

    -   Fake Out

    -   Hone Claws

Start by capturing Snorunt. Quilava and Meowth should not be too
threatening at this phase as you should have type coverage but watch out
for Minior getting off a Rollout or self-destructing. Type: Null is
bulky at this point in the game, but if you can status it, you’ll be
able to whittle it down.

After witnessing a scene and going north, you’ll be able to fight Rift
Gyarados.

<u>Dimensional Rift Gyarados (Rift Field)</u>

-   Rift Gyarados, Level 20. Type: Water/Ghost. Stat Spread:
    70/110/100/90/78/100. 1 Shield.

    -   Bite

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Ice Fang

    -   Thunder Fang

This is the first of the Rift fights in Rejuvenation. Essentially it has
shield bars like Max Raid Battles in Gen 8 Pokémon. You must deplete the
shield before you can do damage. Luckily though it has no way to recover
lost stats, so being able to use a move like Growl, Charm, or Noble Roar
can really help here. Putting it to sleep is a good way to do this, with
the added benefit on this field of draining health while asleep every
turn. Making it too weak to knock out your Pokémon is the key to
victory. (Winning: +1 Karma) However, the plot will progress even if you
lose.

A couple quick, optional things:

First thing we can do is talk to the grandfather in the train station,
who’ll give you a *Exp. Candy S.*

Head back to Mei and Ayuda to claim your reward for getting all five
cells so far: *TM49 Echoed Voice*!

Return to Jenner’s Lab and head upstairs. You’ll need to battle Madelis’
Houndoom as Melia, using Togepi. It requires a LOT of luck to win.
(Winning: +1 Melia Relationship Point). Losing still progresses the
game. After a lot of cutscenes, you’ll be back outside.

# Chapter 2: Redemption

## Junction Bridge - JBridg1

Head outside of the lab and talk to Karrina. She’ll want us to go to the
Junction Bridge on the left side of the city, so accept fast travel.

Head into the lab to battle Dr. Jenkel.

<u>Mad Scientist Dr. Jenkel (Factory Field)</u>

-   Munna, Level 18. @ Elemental Seed.

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Psybeam

    -   Moonlight

    -   Light Screen

-   Munna, Level 19. @ Elemental Seed.

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Psybeam

    -   Shock Wave

    -   Reflect

-   Musharna, Level 20. @ PULSE Plus. Typing: Psychic/Fairy. Ability:
    Misty Surge. Stat Spread: 115/50/90/90/80/10

    -   Mist Ball

    -   Fairy Wind

    -   Misty Terrain

    -   Wish

Either partner will do well here, his Frogadier hits hard with Water
Pulse and Misty Terrain boosted Icy Wind, while her Grimer can smack
super effective STAB on each with Knock Off and Poison Fang. Low stats
including abysmal speed prevents Musharna from doing much damage - stall
out the screens from the Munna if you need to, take out the Munna and
hit it hard with STAB moves and you’ll be just fine.

After the battle, you’ll be gifted *TM94 Rock Smash!* Use it outside,
down and to the right, and you’ll see a **Blitzle.** Give it a
GourmetTreat and it’ll battle you! On the way out, head into Jenkel’s
lab one more time and pick up 6 *Cell Batteries!* Make sure you save
three of them for a quest in chapter 8.

To the right of Junction Bridge: the sewer stairs there will now be
open. Here you’ll find a Rare Candy. Also:

ZCell 006: Gearen Sewers

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image6.png"
style="width:6.58333in;height:5.01042in" />

Exit through the top. A dumpster on the right has a *Reverse Candy*
within. At night, you can go into the alleyway area. The purple flower
in the center has a *Super Potion,* in between the dumpster and table on
the left is a *Red Shard* and two tiles right and two tiles down from
there is a hidden *Telluric Seed*. The dumpster just before the stairs
contains a *Green Shard,* and the tile between the two stacks of really
tall grass hides a *Super Repel.*

ZCell 007: Gearen Alleyway (Only accessible at night)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image7.png"
style="width:6.69106in;height:5.02604in" />

Go up and give one of the Munna a GourmetTreat to catch it if you want.

One more quest we can do now takes place at the Chrisola Hotel.

-   Enter the room in the right hallway on the right, with Minccino in
    it. Talk to the old lady and agree to find Minccino.

-   Head out to the lobby and find it near the elevator.

-   Enter the left hallway and you’ll see it right away on the bottom
    side

-   Follow it left and around, and you’ll see Team Xen Grunts take it
    away!

-   Go to Gearen Park and fight the Grunts on the east side of the park

-   Return to the old woman, who’ll let you battle to catch
    **Minccino!**

Especially if you’ve been catching all the Pokémon so far, you probably
will have enough AP to get the Golden Hammer. This makes it so we don’t
need to teach Rock Smash to any Pokémon in order to smash rocks!

There are Pokémon in trees in the next area. If you want, bring a
Pokémon with Headbutt to the next area, either Seel or Litleo work
great.

This is all we can do in the city for now, so buy a $300 ticket to take
the train east to Route 2!

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - You guys alright? (Venam -1)  
            - Cheer up, guys... (Ren +1)  
            - ... (Neutral)

## Route 2 - 2Route1

There’s a *Carbos* right and down from the red flower on the left as you
enter. The grassy spot in the middle of dirt right from Meganium hides a
*Green Shard.*

If you use Old Rod, you can only find Finneon here. Remember to to get
Dedenne to continue Zumi’s quest. The next gym is fighting type, so most
of these are going to be decent options for now.

Head down the stairs and go up at the fork. Left of a red flower is a
hidden *Relaxed Mint,* and one tile down from the right patch of two
tall grasses bordering the river is a *Red Shard.* Back down and right
from here, the rightmost isolated grassy tile before the bridge has a
*Blue Shard.*

There are a few more encounter types we can find here with our new field
moves.

Each tree is either a “low” tree or a “high” tree. Low trees have more
infrequent encounters, but typically the rarer Pokémon. North of the
bridge you’ll cross the right tree is a low tree and the left tree is a
high tree. Be wary of Pineco’s Self-Destruct. Diglett will be available
much more easily in the next area.

You can talk to the Aipom across the bridge to catch them instead of
worrying about Headbutt. We’ll want to catch two Aipom here for a trade
later.

If you talk to Kecleon, he’ll sell you stuff. We’ll be back for a side
quest with him later.

<u>Kecleon Market</u>

*Poke Ball* $200

*Potion* $300

*Antidote* $100

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Repel* $350

You can also find a *GourmetTreat* in the rightmost patch of grass up in
the area up from Kecleon, as well as:

ZCell 008: Route 2

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image8.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:4.94792in" />

Cross the bridge to the left, four tiles left of the bottom of the
bridge is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Just up the stairs, two tiles left of
the bottom red flowers is a hidden *Rose Incense.* In the upper corner
three tiles right and two down from the guy there is a hidden *Friend
Ball.* If you talk to the painter here, he’ll wish to see Cherrim. We’ll
return to this quest later.

Heading back and to the right, there is a gold healing star, useful as
we won’t have to run back to the city to heal anymore. To the south past
the fisherman, the tile down and left from the second red flower
contains an *Ability Capsule.*

After you’re done, enter Amethyst Cave.

## Amethyst Cave 1st Visit - ACave1

After a conversation with a shady figure, you’ll have control in the
cave.

Amethyst Cave (Crystal Cavern)

|               |          |                |          |

| **Carbink**   | 2        |                |          |

Go left. Two tiles down and one left from the lady hides a *Nugget.* To
the left pick up the *Quiet Mint,* and the *Mineral Ball* in the bottom
right part of the nearby cart. Down from here, the divot in the wall
contains a *Green Shard.*

Head to the right, and downstairs. This is a new area technically with
different encounters.

Amethyst Depths (Crystal Cavern)

| Diglett     | 9        |
| Carbink     | 2        |

Again, Xatu is another good choice for the upcoming gym.

The wall below the second Joltik contains an *HP Up.* Talk to Ren.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Is that strange? (Ren +1)  
            - What about them? (Neutral)

The rock below him contains a *Potion,* and one tile down from the box
to the left is a hidden *Antidote.* Crossing the bridge, the bottom left
box of the set on the right contains a *Green Shard.* A rock below here
contains a *Resist Wing,* and there is a *Blue Shard* three tiles down
and one tile left.

Head downstairs. The boxes directly left of the healing star contain a
*Revive.* Grab the *Blue Shard.* Then cross the bridge to get a *Modest
Mint.* The tile at the top above the metal tracks contains a *Fire Gem.*
You can give a GourmetTreat to catch **Lunatone**. Activate Panel 1
while you are here, we will activate 5 more for a quest later.

Heal and save, then head up. Pick up the *Rift Dex* to learn about Rift
Galvantula. Partner up with Ren or Venam and take on Rift Galvantula!

<u>Dimensional Rift Galvantula</u>

-   Joltik, Level 22.

    -   Electroweb

    -   Toxic Thread

    -   Struggle Bug

    -   Confusion

    -   Electroweb

    -   Cross Poison

    -   Toxic Thread

    -   Sucker Punch

This one isn’t too bad, though the Joltik are annoying with their
Electroweb attack. Unless you have priority, you’re going to end up
going last, so have something with enough special defense to take their
Electric/Bug/Poison attacks and hit back hard. Venam and Ren are both
worthy partners here.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - You think I can do it? (Neutral)  
            - Where do I go next? (Ren +2)

Back in the city, two optional things we can do now: first, talk to Zumi
in the library, who’ll give you the *Advanced Pokedex* if you caught
Dedenne. She’ll also send you on the next mission to get Drifloon.

Second, if you go to the Chrisola Hotel, our travels to Route 2 will
prompt the girl in the first room in the right hallway to give you
**Shinx!**

Anyways, back in Amethyst Cave, we can head north. Smash the rock and
pick up the hidden *Red Shard* in the rail below. The wall behind a rock
to the right has a *Super Potion,* and the second minecart above
contains a *Mineral Ball.* The rail to the left of this minecart and one
tile up contains a *Green Shard.* To the left, the wall down from the
rock to smash is a *Zinc,* and the machine above here has a *Mineral
Ball.* The wall to the left of the leftmost machine contains a *Reverse
Candy.*

We can’t really access the meadow yet, so head right and up. Talk to the
hooded guy then get a hidden *Electric Gem* in the right rock. In the
next room, the wall immediately on the right contains a *Genius Wing.*
Two tiles down and three left from the first rock smash is a hidden
*Reverse Candy.* On the right side of the room, the top box contains an
*X Attack.* Head through the southeast exit.

A box to the right contains a *Repel.* Down and to the right, the right
side of a drill machine contains an *X Defend* and the last rock
contains a *Rock Gem.* Go immediately to the left in the next room to
get a *Mineral Ball* in the wall. Follow the path until you meet Nim!

In the altered dimension, solve her difficult puzzles and prepare for a
battle.

<u>Apprentice Nim (Psychic Terrain)</u>

-   Inkay, Level 20.

    -   Psywave

    -   Feint Attack

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Swagger

-   Darumaka, Level 20.

    -   Fire Fang

    -   Bite

    -   Headbutt

    -   Taunt

-   Lunatone, Level 21. @ Passho Berry.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Ancientpower

    -   Cosmic Power

    -   Confusion

-   Solrock, Level 21. @ Rindo Berry.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Fire Spin

    -   Psywave

    -   Cosmic Power

The Solrock and Lunatone can be frustrating with Rock Slide, but
anything speedier can knock them out without much difficulty. Inkay
won’t be that much of a threat, so you can probably do well by letting
it sit there while you beat up on the other side. Hidden Power is
boosted in this field, so if you have it on your special attackers,
especially those with type advantages, you’ll be fine.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Yes (Nim +2)  
            - No. (Nim -2)

She’ll give you the *Room ID Card!* When you are back in the cave, the
wall to the left of the bottom stairs contains a *Super Potion,* and the
one above and right of the top stairs contains a *Reverse Candy.* Head
into Sheridan Village to the north.

## Sheridan Village - SVill1

Listen to a cutscene with Aelita and the Elder. At the moment it costs
money to heal here, so we’re gonna start by heading all the way north
into Sheridan Arena. Then knock on Keta’s door at the very top, then
enter the inn back in the village. Head upstairs.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - I will. (Aelita +3)  
            - Why me?? (Aelita -1)

Now healing is free, so we can explore Sheridan Village now.

Enter the first house and talk to a girl. This opens a quest for way
later.

Go left to enter the shop.

<u>Sheridan Village Shop</u>

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Potion* $300

*Super Potion* $700

*Ice Heal* $250

*Antidote* $100

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Super Repel* $500

*Reverse Candy* $50

Enter the shop on a weekday morning and you’ll see Beth and her Miltank.
Talk to her to get a free *Moomoo Milk* sample, then her shop will open.
Note that Berry Juice can be a pretty good hold item at this stage of
the game.

<u>Sheridan Village Drinks (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday Mornings
Only) (1 Badge)</u>

*Berry Juice* $100

You can sneak around the back of the shop, if you do, talk to the shop
owner from behind to get a *Super Potion!* A tile left and up from the
backdoor on the outside is a hidden *TinyMushroom.*

You’ll notice a trucker up from here: this trucker will drive us for
free between Sheridan and Gearen, so take advantage of this instead of
paying the train fee whenever possible.

Head east. Above the boxes is a hidden *Ability Capsule.* Enter the inn.
Note that the Inn will heal your team for a fee right now, but after a
few story events it will become free. Talk to a girl in the lobby to get
a *Sweet Heart.* Talk to a girl in the first room on the left in the
vertical hallway and take on her quest. The woman on the right in the
hall will offer to teach you a few more moves for shards:

<u>Sheridan Village Move Tutor</u>

Worry Seed 2 Red Shards

Uproar 2 Green Shards

There is an Audino breeder towards the top: every time you beat them,
you will get 3 *Exp. Candy S.* Once you’re ready, we can take care of
some side quests.

At some point, level your Cherubi to Level 25 so that it evolves into
**Cherrim.** On Route 2, in a camper in the far northwest part of the
route, show the guy here your Cherrim for a *Miracle Seed.*

There is a day care in town. Take your Jigglypuff and any other Pokemon
in the Fairy egg group there and breed to get **Igglybuff.** Then, trade
it with a girl in the inn to get a **Smoochum** holding a *Twisted
Spoon!*

Talk to the truck guy and have him take you back to Gearen City. In
Jenner’s lab, use the Room ID Card to get the *Exp. Share!* Read the
note, then talk to Melia’s wardrobe to get the *Audition Tape.* Plug it
in to the computer to watch a lore cutscene if you want.

Head into the Gearen Lab and go to Jenner’s lab. Head to the left and
talk to Professor Hawthorne. He wants a Dex that has seen 100 Pokémon -
this is an easy goal if you haven’t been avoiding all the trainers and
optional battles. Grab either the **Elekid** egg or the **Magby** egg
and read Jenner’s journal if you want.

Talk to him again, and he’ll request a dex with 350 seen. You might not
have this yet but once you do, he’ll offer you the other of the Johto
baby eggs.

Return to Sheridan Arena at the top.

Head up and talk to the **Swablu** flying overhead for a battle. Return
to Keta’s house and talk to him in his garden.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - I am. (Keta +2)  
            - But i just got here... (Keta -2)

## Amethyst Grotto and Sheridan Help Quests - AGrot1

After accepting Keta’s quest, head all the way out of the village and go
back all the way through Amethyst Cave. In the second room, interact
with this box of plants, then head north. Go to the west side of the
room, where you’ll see a man getting assaulted by **Solrock.** Challenge
it to a battle and catch it to proceed.

Continue through the cave. Once at the entrance, head west until you see
a red rock. Touch the stone, and a door will open. Enter and go
downstairs. On the left above a tree is a hidden *Moon Ball*.

Amethyst Grotto (No Field)

| Meowth        | 31       |
| Jigglypuff    | 25       |
| **Girafarig** | 8        |

On the right side, two tiles right and three tiles above the rock smash
is a hidden *Red Shard.* A rock smash above hides a *Heart Scale* in the
left side of a red tree. On the left, above the stage thing, in the
middle of a red tree is another *Red Shard.*

Once you’re ready, talk to the spirit of Keta. He will give you the
*Soul Stone.* Then exit and watch the scene and fast travel back to
Sheridan.

Returning to the inn in Sheridan you’ll be given $8,000 for saving the
guy.

Now is a good time to do the Sheridan Village Help Quests. The help
center is in the upper right part of the village.

<u>HQuest 8: The Hidden Library 2</u>

-   Start outside the help center and talk to the backpacker.

-   Truck to Gearen, then go to the Chrisola Hotel and talk to Karen in
    front.

-   Head to Dr. Jenkel’s lab and watch the scene

-   Go to Gearen Park and talk to Karen. Enter the library.

-   Pick up the green book behind the pillar at the entrance.

-   Enter the main chamber and pick up the blue book.

We can encounter Pokémon here, but there’s only 1 type: **Unown!**

-   Pick up the purple book nearby. To the right there is a 2-tile space
    without a bookshelf on the bottom, one tile up from the right one
    contains an *Ether.*

-   Go right for the orange book and up for the red book. Also:

ZCell 009: Hidden Library

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image9.png"
style="width:6.66667in;height:5.04167in" />

-   Go down. Pick up the lime book, and *TM63 Embargo.*

-   Head back up and go all the way up, picking up the sky-blue book.

-   Head up. Next to the door, there are candle things. The second from
    the top on the right contains a hidden *Charcoal!*

-   Follow Karen into the north room. On the left, pick up the golden
    book*.* On the right, pick up the lemon book.

-   Now that we have found nine books, head back to where we saw Elgyem
    flying by earlier. Interact with the bookshelf it’s on and place the
    books inside. A level 1 **Elgyem** will then battle you!

-   Head back into the upper room and talk to Karen.

-   While she’ll get the Mega Ring, you’ll get the *Ancient Book.* This
    will allow you to read Garufan prophecies. Check out the ones on the
    wall, if you’re interested.

-   Head back to Sheridan Village when you’re done and talk to the
    backpacker.

-   You can choose to give him the book or not. I recommend giving him
    the book since we can get another later, and if you choose to,
    you’ll get *Blue Moon Ice Cream!*

-   Claim your reward: $950 and *Water Stone*! (+1 Karma, +1 Karen
    Relationship Point)

<u>HQuest 9: Stolen Cargo!</u>

-   Use the trucker to get to Gearen City, then go to Oceana Pier. Head
    to the southeast, then follow the guy into the warehouse.

-   If you try to go north, you’ll get shocked, and your Pokémon will
    faint. The key here is to transform the Factory field into
    Short-Circuit via battling the Electrike trainer in the southwest
    and getting it to use Discharge. Once you’ve done this, head through
    the middle arrows.

-   Venam will join you for a battle. Once you’ve won, she’ll leave.

-   Before we leave the warehouse, interact with the panel to switch the
    direction of the middle tile, then head right. Grab *TM09 Venoshock*
    then head back to Sheridan.

-   Claim your reward: $950 and five *GourmetTreats*. (+1 Karma, +1
    Venam Relationship Point)

<u>HQuest 10: Trade Me!</u>

-   Claim your reward: $1,920 and *Rare Candy*! (+1 Karma)

<u>HQuest 11: Fetch an Item!</u>

-   Start by heading through Amethyst Cave to Route 2.

-   Pick up one of the blue item balls. If you have 50,000, you’re
    welcome to pay for the item, but if not, you’ll get teleported to
    the THIEF’S DUNGEON!

-   After talking to the grunt and getting out, memorize the map on the
    wall. If you don’t take the path outlined, you will get destroyed…
    Enter the door that corresponds to yellow to get an *Ice Stone,* or
    *Dusk Stone* depending on random chance.

-   Escape, and return to the help center. Talk to the guy to get *Blue
    Moon Ice Cream.*

-   Claim your reward: $1890, Casteliacone! (+1 Karma)

Real quick there’s another quest we can do. Take the truck back to
Gearen and enter Karrina’s hideout near the sewers. Talk to her, and
she’ll send us on the gang fight quest. Head to Route 2 and enter
Amethyst Cave.

Head up, and beat the guy at the end to get **Houndour!**

That’s all we can take care of for now, so head back to Sheridan to see
Keta.

## Diamond Punch Badge? - Badge1.5

As soon as you’re ready, talk to Aelita on the battlefield

Gale Strike: Fighting \| Physical \| 60 power \| 100% accuracy \|
Guaranteed critical hit if user is under 50% HP \| On Forest Field,
power is boosted x1.5 and deals additional Grass-type damage.

This battle is the first to really show you how well the trainers
compensate for their type disadvantages here -- almost everything has a
Dark or Rock type move. Scraggy is a good dud to leave out, especially
if you can paralyze it -- it doesn’t do enough damage to really be
threatening at least compared to his other Pokémon. Combusken can be
tough once it outspeeds you, but also has Protect so it might be smart
to focus your attacks on the other Pokémon. A very tough fight but you
have lots of team options to make it more possible.

Sensei runs off instead of paying up a badge. Follow Aelita into the
waterfall cave.

## Carotos Mountain - CMount1

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Yes. (Aelita +1)  
            - No. (Aelita -1)

You’ll team up with Aelita here, so she’ll heal you but catching wild
Pokémon is a bit tougher.

Carotos Mountain (Volcano Field)

|              |          |                |          |
|--------------|----------|----------------|----------|

| **Rolycoly** | 9        |                |          |
| **Nosepass** | 2        |                |          |

On the left, past a rock smash, is *TM121 Fire Spin*.

Once you cross the bridge to the right, prepare for battle and talk to
the robotic looking thing. It will challenge you and has a Shadow
**Ponyta!**

Head through the door, pick up a hidden *Full Heal* in the barrel to the
right, and battle the Xen Grunts. The second grunt will have a Shadow
**Vanillite.** The third has a Shadow **Bonsly.** Defeat SEC and his
Flareon, then pick up the *Red Shard* hidden in the barrel to the right.

If you head to the right, grab the *Ultra Ball* in the left side of the
machine as you go. The bottom left of the four barrels contains a
*Reverse Candy*. Down from here, you can grab *TM43 Flame Charge.*
Observe the passwords written all over the walls in this floor. There is
a *Synthetic Seed* as well as a *Fire Stone* if you follow the path to
the right. Right now, this will evolve Pansear.

SEC will require you to input a password to move on. The passwords are,
in order, BEAUTY, IDOL, SHADOW. Talk to it a few more times and it will
challenge you with a Shadow **Quagsire.**

Once you’re ready, go up the elevator and head towards Madelis’ Palace.
Go inside when you get the chance to, and you’ll team up with Keta.

Head into the left room. Grab the *Hyper Potion* on the left and
*Revive* up above. At the top of the room, grab the *Yellow Key.*

Head back out and go into the right room. Talk to Sharon to get the
*Green Key* and grab the *Fresh Water* in the top right. Talk to **Mime
Jr.** in the top right to take it with you.

Go back and enter the top left room. Grab the *Red Key.*

Finally, enter the top right room. Make sure you grab the *Up-Grade,
Dusk Ball* and the *Blue Key.*

Head back out into the foyer and insert each key into the keyholes on
the walls.

Head up, then up again. You’ll now have to fight Madelis.

<u>Xen Executive Madelis (No Field)</u>

-   Floette, Level 22.

    -   Magical Leaf

    -   Draining Kiss

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Protect

-   Salandit, Level 22.

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Flame Burst

    -   Venoshock

    -   Fake Out

-   Golbat, Level 24.

    -   Wing Attack

    -   Confuse Ray

    -   Double Team

    -   Venoshock

-   Cufant, Level 24.

    -   Iron Head

    -   Stomp

    -   Growl

    -   Rollout

-   Houndoom, Level 25. @ Chople Berry.

    -   Snarl

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Thunder Fang

    -   Crunch

-   Shadow Mewtwo, Level 27.

    -   Energy Ball

    -   Psychic

    -   Miracle Eye

    -   Aura Sphere

    -   Shadow Chill

This one doesn’t have to be won, though it is very doable. Winning
grants +1 Karma and +1 Relationship Point with Madelis. This battle
looks rough, but you’ll have Keta on your side, so it’s functionally a
12 on 6. A rock type can demolish half of her team, and Keta’s fast
fighting Pokémon will help you out. Two of them have fake out, so when
you get to Mewtwo, try to take advantage of those turns to deal heavy
damage to Mewtwo. Mewtwo also takes damage every time it attacks thanks
to Fever Pitch, so take advantage of that and dish out as much damage as
you can as soon as her other Pokémon are all wiped out.

Afterwards, head into the door behind Madelis’ chair, and go down the
lift.

We haven’t had enough legendary battles with only one gym badge quite
yet, so follow Aelita up and grab the *Rift Dex Info.*

After a brief scene, you’ll be taken into a rift space. Talk to
Volcanion and answer its question and the battle will begin!

<u>Dimensional Rift Volcanion</u>

-   Volcanion, Level 23. @ Demon Stone. Ability: Water Absorb. Stat
    Spread: 110/60/80/90/200/20. 2 Shields.

    -   Water Pulse

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Bulldoze

    -   Rock Slide

So, you’ll probably be faster than this guy. With only 110/80 on the
physical side, it’s not too hard to whittle its shields, then its entire
health bar down with some decent STAB moves.

Once you’re free, head to the gate in Sheridan, and enter the spring.

Spring of Purification (Forest Field)

|              |          |                         |          |

| Oddish       | 4        |                         |          |

Pick up the *Magical Seed* up from the entrance. Head up and talk to the
pair.

Dialogue Choice:

            - Are you ok? (+1 Karma)  
            - Who’s Vivian? (Neutral)

Once you leave the shrine, Keta will ask you to fast travel to Amethyst
Grotto. If you’re ready, feel free. Otherwise, we now have up to 7 new
Pokémon we can use by purifying them! Shadow Pokémon in Rejuvenation
have moves they can’t normally get, for example Ponyta has Fell Stinger
and Bonsly has Shift Gear. To purify, keep the shadow Pokémon in your
party and run around, or use the Purify Chamber in the PC.

One more thing we can do: head into the house in the bottom right of
Sheridan. Gothitelle will battle us!

<u>Crescent’s Gothitelle (No Field)</u>

-   Gothitelle, Level 32. @ Twisted Spoon.

    -   Psychic

    -   Shock Wave

    -   Calm Mind

    -   Signal Beam

If you win, you’ll be able to pick up **Gothita** behind!

Head into Amethyst Grotto ready for the REAL gym fight.

## Diamond Punch Badge - Badge02

Well, that’s about all we can take care of at this point.

Head back to Amethyst Grotto with a fully healed team.

The Spirit of Keta will be able to give us a badge, so let’s challenge
him.

<u>Sensei Keta (No Field)</u>

-   Larvesta, Level 22

    -   Flame Charge

    -   Take Down

    -   Bug Bite

    -   Magnet Rise

-   Roselia, Level 22. @ Occa Berry.

    -   Magical Leaf

    -   Hidden Power Water

    -   Venoshock

    -   Leech Seed

    -   Poison Sweep

-   Lapras, Level 24. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Body Slam

    -   Water Pulse

    -   Freeze Dry

    -   Ice Shard

-   Gallade, Level 25. @ Leftovers.

    -   Low Sweep

    -   Psycho Cut

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Poison Sweep

Compared to Novae, this battle won’t be too hard but is still scary.
Gallade hits hard and is fast. In general, you want to try to set up on
one of the weaker Pokémon like Roselia or Larvesta, if you can, it won’t
be too awful.

After you win, you’ll get the Diamond Fist Badge! This enables you to
cut and puts our level cap at 30. He’ll also leave behind *TM103
Stacking Shot.*

Talk to Aelita upstairs and agree to sleep.
# Chapter 3: Tainted Light

## Sewers Visit 2 - Sewer2

Eldest will give us *Super Potions.* From Route 2, head into the city.
If you’ve completed Karrina’s Amethyst Cave quest, you’ll get +2 Aelita
Relationship Points. Two tiles to the left of the tree to the left of
Venam’s house contains a hidden *Repel.*

Make your way to the sewers. Talk to Amanda for a battle.

<u>Trainer Amanda</u>

-   Bronzor, Level 24. @ Heat Rock.

    -   Sunny Day

    -   Gyro Ball

    -   Confuse Ray

-   Druddigon, Level 26. @ Charcoal.

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Dragon Tail

    -   Sunny Day

    -   Metal Claw

This is a surprisingly tough battle, namely due to Miltank. Once it
paralyzes your Pokémon and starts stomping, it’s hard to get off a hit
sometimes. Putting Miltank to sleep long enough to knock it is one way
to win this one. Anyways, after battle, she’ll give you *HM01 Cut*!

Relationship Point Choices:

            - I'll get it done! (Karrina +2, Aelita +1)  
            - ... (Neutral)  
            - I'm kinda scared... (Karrina -2)

Enter the sewers and head to the back, cutting along the way.

Relationship Point Choices:

- Hi Lucha. (Venam +1)

- You're Venam's friend? (Venam +2)

- Have we met? (Neutral)

Chrysalis Courtyard (Grassy Terrain)

|                     |          |
|---------------------|----------|
| <u>Grass</u>        | <u>%</u> |
| **Meowth (Alolan)** | 30       |

| Girafarig           | 10       |
| **Porygon**         | 2        |

All of these will also be available to catch later.

After Venam asks you to figure out how to get in, read the inscription
to the right: Password \#3: 8187. Head over to the left side and enter
the left hole in the hedge to get a weird key. Use it on the first gate.
Then go through the hole on the left and open the second gate from
behind. Talk to Venam at the door, then sneak in the window.

Answer the questions as you like. When you regain control, head upstairs
and talk to Marianette to get her to join your party! Talk to her in
every room of the house for background info. Enter Indriad’s room by
talking to the maids guarding it.

He’ll send you on three trials. Before we do that though, talk to the
maid in the entry room and she’ll give you a bonus trial we can do while
completing the others.

Take the downstairs left door to the Hedge Garden. Essentially a
Dusknoir will warp us back if we ever turn around, so make sure you’re
always following the red ivy to continue. We can come back without
Dusknoir in a bit to get all the items.

Relationship Point Choices:

- Yeah, I am. (Marianette -1)

- It was nothing... (Marianette +2)

- You flatter me... (Marianette +1)

- Say it again. (Marianette -2)

Afterwards you must fight a servant!

<u>Servant Moya (Grassy Terrain)</u>

-   Dusknoir, Level 35. @ Dusknoir Crest. 2 Shields.

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Shadow Punch

    -   Psychic

    -   Brick Break

This can be tough, but Marianette’s Pokemon do help out

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - It was cool. (Neutral)  
            - Calm down. (Marianette -3)  
            - You were a great help! (Marianette +3) 

Enter at the top and save Luca.

Relationship Point Choices:

- You're growing. (Marianette +2)

- Yeah, you are. (Marianette -2)

- You can change that! (Marianette +3)

Back in the maze, from the bottom: A path in the southwest leads you to
a *Normal Gem.* A dead-end to the west says Password 1 is 7896. Another
dead end in the bottom right leads you to 2 *Exp. Candy M’s!* Two more
towards the middle of the maze give us a *PP Up* and two *Super
Potions*. Another in the northwest corner is an *Elixir.* Towards the
end is a *Sitrus Berry.* You’ll also find the first optional maid, Lara,
so defeat her to continue that quest.

Now follow the right path through the mansion. In the dining room, talk
to Marianette, you may randomly get a chance to give her an Oran Berry.
This gives +7 Marianette Relationship Points.

Exit to the right. If you hug the left wall and go through a secret
passage, you’ll see another inscription. This one says Password 2 is
3135. Head up and beat the second optional maid, Yara, hiding in the
left corner.

At the top, you need to navigate two pieces onto the colored tiles, but
the buttons control both pieces. Carefully use the walls to your
advantage to solve this one. Three times and you’re done: save Lenny.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - To instill fear. (Marianette +2)  
            - Who knows? (Marianette -1)  
            - It's a fun hobby! (Marianette -3)

Next, head back out the way we came in through the courtyard. Talk to
the maid in one of the gardens to the south, Deandra, for a battle.

We’ve now fought all three maids, so return to the one in the main room.
She unlocks all the doors in the mansion! Head through the door on the
left and go up. Inside you’ll find a *Full Heal, Reverse Candy, Ability
Capsule,* and *Elixir.* Talk to Marianette while you’re in here and ask
about a box to fight a **Bronzor.** Finally, return to the room we woke
up in and go through the upper doors. You can’t go through with
Marianette with you, so we’ll have to come back when she’s not with us
anymore.

Head back into the courtyard and enter the Absol statue.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - I'll be fine! (Marianette +1)  
            - HURRY AND FREE ME! (Marianette -4)  
            - It's okay, stay calm (Marianette +4)

The first two rooms are not too hard, grab the *Max Repel* while you’re
at it. In the final room, you just must push the colored statues onto
the respective tile without getting caught by Tangrowth, then guide
Tangrowth to its own tile.

Relationship Point Choices:

- You did well. (Marianette +4)

- You cut it kinda close... (Marianette -2)

If you have at least five points with Marianette up till now, you’ll get
the following dialogue choice:

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - It's okay Marianette. (Marianette +8)  
            - I don't know... (Marianette -12)

Now that Marianette is no longer following us, we can go through the
path in our room again. Enter the three passwords (7896, 3135, 8187) in
the machine, then head through the frozen prison to speak with Anju.

To get an item, tell her the truth here, though this item doesn’t do
anything unique for us yet. To do so, tell her the world is safe,
Sheridan is safe, but Hiyoshi is destroyed. If you do answer truthfully,
she will give you *Anju’s Pendant!*

## Normality Badge - Badge03

Exit and return to the mansion. Before we proceed, exit all the way out
to Gearen to pick up what Aelita dropped: *3 Super Potions, 4 Exp. Candy
M, 2 Exp. Candy S, 2 Chesto Berries,* a *Cheri Berry,* and *Protective
Pads.* Back in the mansion, in the main doors, there is an Audino
breeder, and each time you win, you’ll get 5 *Exp. Candy S*.

As soon as you’re ready, follow the path up from here.

    -   Aerial Ace

    -   Brutal Swing

Multipulse: Type is the same as the user's held Plate (like Judgment) \|
Special \| 65 power \| 100% accuracy \| On Blessed Field, power is
boosted x1.3.

Overall, what is said in the gym guide is good advice. The first thing
you must be cautious of is Delcatty, who likes to Baton Pass +2 in both
defenses to Chatot or Drampa, who can then boost and go on a rampage. A
move like Roar is a good counter for that. Otherwise, a decently rounded
team should be able to deal with most of the Pokémon here - four are
dual types with varied weaknesses.

Once you win, you’ll be awarded with the Normality Badge! Our new level
cap is now 35. Enjoy the following cutscene.

# Chapter 4: Isolation

## 3 Badge Quests - 3BQuest1

Start at East Gearen. Return to the sewers where the mansion was, then
head to up to grab *TM42 Facade*! Head outside.

Go talk to Shana in the Gearen Lab to continue the Johto quest. You’ll
now have to fight Bugsy with the starter you picked and a few more
Pokémon.

A couple Flame Wheels from Quilava plus a Rock Tomb from Onix made this
one simple on the Cyndaquil path. After this, you’ll get another
*Virtual Badge*! This will finish her leg of this quest.

The Poke Ball shop in Gearen has two new balls now, which can be useful
for low catch rate water types like Basculin.

forward.

We can also get more drinks!

<u>Sheridan Village Drinks New Items (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday
Mornings Only) (3+ Badges)</u>

*Lemonade* $350

*Moomoo Milk* $500

Head back down into Amethyst Cave and make your way to the first room

blocking your path. Smash them and emerge in Pom-Pom Meadow. Cut the
trees down here to get access.

You can find infinite *Yellow Nectar* in the pots, and *TM133 Mud Shot*
at the top.

I had Quilava, Onix, and Qwilfish, so I took advantage of Clefairy to
have Qwilfish set up Toxic Spikes, letting Onix easily wall Miltank and
Jigglypuff. After winning, you’ll get the third *Virtual Badge.*

That’s not all, he’ll then offer you the next challenge, this time
against Morty.

<u>Gym Leader Morty (Glitch Field)</u>

This battle sharply increases the difficulty for the Cyndaquil route! I
ended up relying on RNG to win to some extent. Essentially, use Eevee
and Onix to take out Misdreavus and Haunter, switching to avoid Perish
Song and Curse damage. Mismagius can be taken down with Eevee, Onix,
Qwilfish working together, then save Quilava for Gengar, where you must
use Smokescreen and pray all his Hypnosis and Ice Punch miss long enough
for you to finally take it down. I recommend attacking first with
Thunderpunch so that gets disabled by Cursed Body instead of Fire Punch.
If you succeed, grab your fourth *Virtual Badge.* That’s all we can do
with him for now.

The girl here is the Move Deleter, should you need to remove any moves.

| **Boltund**  | 1        |                |          |

You can also interact with **Surskit** dancing on the pond surface.

The leftmost cut tree hides a *Sitrus Berry* behind.

On the other side, head down and to the right until you come upon a
market. All the events and shops here can only be accessed during
daytime. Talk to Aelita during the day.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - I'm starving... (Aelita +2)  
            - No distractions! (Neutral)

If you go with the first option, you’ll get *Vanilla, Chocolate,* or
*Strawberry Ice Cream*.

<u>Route 3 Left Vendor</u>

*Reverse Candy* $50

*Sachet* $1000

*Soda Pop* $300

*Sweet Heart* $100

*Red Nectar* $550

*Whipped Dream* $1000

We’ll eventually need Sachet and Whipped Dream to evolve Swirlix and
Spritzee from earlier. We’re also eventually (like, 3 or 4 more badges,
but still) going to want 10 Sweet Hearts for a quest, so go ahead and
get those.

<u>Route 3 Upper Right Vendor</u>

*Vanilla Ice Cream* $400

*Choc Ice Cream* $600

*Berry Ice Cream* $800

She’ll also rarely have *Blue Moon Ice Cream* to sell. Ideally, we want
to get a few of each for a side quest later.

The flower above this vendor contains a hidden *Green Shard.* Down and
to the left is *TM117 Pay Day!* This move, in conjunction with Pickup,
is the most effective way to farm money in this game. Hidden behind it
is a *Star Piece.*

Head down from the shops. Just before the grass turns lighter, in the
right gap in the tall grass, there is a hidden *Sassy Mint.* Follow the
path around to the right. Heading back into the darker grass, two tiles
up from the lighter grass on the left is a hidden *Blue Shard.* Head up.
Behind the tree below the RV is a hidden *Rare Candy,* to the left one
tile of the center of the tree. Enter the open RV and talk to the hiker
for some *Rose Tea.*

Route 3 South (Forest Field)

| Zangoose     | 1        |                |          |

Head down till the grass changes color twice. In the tall grass all the
way right is a hidden *Super Repel.* Down from here the grass will
change again, the grass patch four right and two down from the trainer
contains a *Red Shard.* Up the stairs to the left of the waterfall is a
*Mystic Water!* Down from the stairs, the last red flower before the
color changes again hides a *Super Potion.* Crossing the bridge here,
two tiles down from the left of a pair of two tall grass tiles hides a
*Honey.*

We’re going to explore the cave on the other side of the route now, so
add a Pokémon to your party with Flash. If you don’t have it yet, it’s
at the Game Corner in East Gearen.

Head up to the top of Route 3 and go to the left and into Phasial Cave.

Old Rod encounters are the same as outside.

Downstairs, the rock at the top contains a *Rock Gem.* To the left,
above the pond, in the 2 tile alcove at the top, the right contains a
*Magical Seed.* Pick up the *Ability Capsule* on the ground to the left.
Defeating the trainer down from here, head down and right. A rock at the
bottom will contain a *Steel Gem.* Up, left, down and, left, there is
another pond. The rock at the top right has a *Reverse Candy.* Head to
the left when you can: going left and up you’ll find a *Mineral Ball*
hidden in the top pillar. Head back to the right. There is a shining
object on the ground in the middle with the pillars: it is the *Ancient
Wing.* The pillar to the left of this has a hidden *Green Shard* in the
top left. There’s a *Blue Shard* to the right. Hug this wall on the
right and go down until you see a small rock, in it is a hidden *Sun
Stone.* A small pillar further down on this wall contains a *Red Shard.*
Head up the ladder here, the rock on the right contains a *Grass Gem.*
Exit to the south!

Attempt to enter Goldenleaf Town to the south. Then, interact with the
tent near the campfire to the north.

When you’re ready talk to Aelita for a battle.

-   Combusken, Level 31. @ Charcoal.

    -   Blaze Kick

    -   Bulk Up

    -   Thunderpunch

    -   Night Slash

This isn’t going to be that tough of a battle - her team is mostly not
fully evolved and doesn’t yet take advantage of the full power STAB
moves. Hawlucha can be dangerous if it gets off a couple Hone Claws --
make sure your best Pokémon to take it out isn’t surprised by Flying Gem
boosted Bounce. Electric, Psychic, and Flying types will overall succeed
here if you’re stuck.

Enter Goldenleaf town at the bottom!

top right tile. Above from here the three out of four splotchy tiles
right before the stairs contain *Burn Heal, Great Ball, Ghost Gem.*

This is all we can do here for now, so head back to Goldenleaf Town.

Cut down the cut-tree in the upper right of this image and head up in

Head into Wispy Park up the stairs at the bottom left. To the left of
the tree immediately to the left and up a tile is a *TinyMushroom.* On
the other side, one tile below the corner in the road is a *Lemonade.*
Grab the *Reverse Candy* on the right.

Talk to the guy up here, then to **Espurr.** It will let you do a
variety of fun things with it; each increases your friendship with it.
Choosing to give it ice cream, especially Blue Moon Ice Cream, raises it
by a lot. Once you’ve gotten its friendship high enough and try to leave
it will join your party. (+1 Karma)

Head down the stairs and around to the right. In the top right of the
park, you’ll see a little pumpkin up above - two tiles up and one right
is a hidden *Ghost Gem.* Head to the left, you’ll see a big pumpkin on
the ground. One tile left, and two right and two up, you’ll find a
*Careful Mint* and a *Rawst Berry.* The right tile of the green tree
below contains a *Green Shard.* Down from here, the empty spot on the
right with a tall grass in all four directions contains an *Ability
Capsule.* The tiny tree below contains a *Hyper Potion.*

Head into the gatehouse on the left side and you’ll be recruited by “C”
to take care of the Dimensional Rift, but only after a 3v3 battle with
his three bug types.

<u>International Police “C”</u>

-   Orbeetle, Level 30.

    -   Signal Beam

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Psybeam

    -   Confuse Ray

-   Ariados, Level 31. @ Poison Barb.

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Bug Bite

    -   Poison Sweep

    -   Swords Dance

-   Galvantula, Level 32. @ Magnet.

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Hidden Power Grass

    -   Charge Beam

    -   Signal Beam

Orbeetle can be annoying if it puts you to sleep, so have a way to
account for that. Ariados isn’t hard to take down but make sure you
don’t let Galvantula sweep after a Charge Beam or two. Fire types will
do well here!

First thing we’re going to do is head into Goldenwood Cave. We couldn’t
get here with Rock Smash before, but now that we can, go ahead and pick
up the *Rare Candy* and *Nugget*! Your Pokémon should be able to now
beat the Leavanny trainer, if you haven’t yet.

Outside the cave, head right as soon as you can. Two tile directly below
the first tree is a *Chesto Berry.* Down the stairs, the top left tile
by the river is a *Nest Ball.* Four tiles right and six down from the
sign is a hidden *Ether.* Across the bridge two tiles up and two tiles
left from the first blue mushrooms you see is a *PP Up.* The middle tile
in the bottom on the left by the water is a *GourmetTreat*. Heading
right, there’s a grove in the top right: below the skinny tree is a
hidden *Great Ball.* Down from here there are two sets of red mushrooms:
above the second is a *Reverse Candy.* In the former garden below the
second accessible tile from the right on top has an *Oran Berry.* To the
left and up from here, a tile above the leftmost red mushrooms before
the stairs contains a *Persim Berry.* Go up the first stairs then left.
Two tiles right of the leftmost red flower is a *Sitrus Berry.* Pick up
the *Guard Spec.* below.

Head up to where you fought Zetta. Once you’re ready, interact with the
dimensional rift to engage Gyarados.

<u>Dimensional Rift Gyarados (Forest Field)</u>

-   Rift Gyarados, Level 40. Type: Water/Ghost. Stat Spread:
    70/110/100/90/78/100. 2 Shields.

    -   Waterfall

    -   Crunch

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Phantom Force

If it is too hard now, you can come back any time before the fifth gym.
Take it out, and C will thank us. (+1 Karma)

## Wispy Tower - WTower1

As soon as that’s over, enter Wispy Tower from the top of Wispy Path. On
the right, below the middle of five trees in the middle of the street is
a hidden *Bold Mint.* Head in.

Relationship Point Choices:

- I accept! (Aelita +2, Narcissa +4)

- I dunno... (Aelita -1, Narcissa -2)

Once that’s done, head back into the Pokémon Center and talk to Aelita.

Relationship Point Choices:

- It was nothing.. (Ren +2, Aelita +2)

- Kinda uncomfortable. (Ren +1, Aelita +1)

- Uhh what's happening? (Neutral)

After a scene you’ll be taken into a battle. Head upstairs to talk to
Aelita and sleep, then defeat the three Xen grunts downstairs disguised
as Ghost types. Upstairs, head into the room at the top. When you regain
control, beat the trainer.

Relationship Point Choices:

- How'd you know? (Neutral)

- I want to go home. (Mosely -2)

- Time to whoop ass! (Neutral)

We’re going back to Wispy Tower. Enter Wispy Tower and go through the
newly revealed path. After talking to Geara, Mosely and Narcissa will
join you.

Enter the left room to get a *Revive.* The room next door will give us a
password, UNBOUND, to enter on the right side of the area. Do so and
enter the room, battling the guy and getting the next password: SOUL. To
the right is an *Ether*, then enter the password and continue. Talk to
the screen in here.

<u>Team Xen Eli and Sharon</u>

-   Tangela, Level 31. @ Eviolite.

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Stun Spore

    -   Ancient Power

    -   Knock Off

-   Lickitung, Level 31. @ Leftovers.

    -   Icy Wind

    -   Body Slam

    -   Rock Tomb

    -   Knock Off

-   Honchkrow, Level 32. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Feint Attack

    -   Swagger

    -   Drill Peck

    -   Thunder Wave

-   Mismagius, Level 32. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Mystical Fire

    -   Hex

    -   Magical Leaf

    -   Psywave

It’s been a while since we’ve had to fight this pair, but it’s luckily
not too much worse this time. Their main strategy here relies on moves
that slow down your Pokémon, by stat-lower and paralysis. Tangela and
Lickitung are slightly bulky, so bring out your own bulky party members
to bring them down and save your faster Pokémon for Honchkrow and
Mismagius and you’ll likely be alright.

After the fight, make sure you heal, then return and go downstairs and
through the door. Go up and you’ll fight Geara!

<u>Xen Executive Geara (Short Circuit Field)</u>

-   Giratina, Level 37. @ Griseous Orb.

    -   Shadow Claw

    -   Dragon Breath

    -   Slash

    -   Thunderbolt

This is a tough fight. You’re gonna need to break the barriers, but
luckily your own Ghost and Dark moves are boosted by the field, so that
should help. Burning it and lowering its special attack may be the key
to victory since it is fast enough to take out your Pokémon quickly. You
can also whittle its HP down by burning/poisoning/leech seeding it and
anticipating what move it will use and switching to a
Normal/Ground/Fairy type.

<u>Xen Executive Geara (Short Circuit Field)</u>

-   Persian, Level 33. @ Normal Gem.

    -   Dig

    -   Covet

    -   Aerial Ace

    -   Seed Bomb

-   Marowak (Alolan), Level 34. @ Thick Club.

    -   Bonemerang

    -   Shadow Bone

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Will-o-Wisp

-   Masquerain, Level 33. @ Charti Berry.

    -   Struggle Bug

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Bubblebeam

    -   Air Slash

-   Morgrem, Level 34. @ Light Clay.

    -   Light Screen

    -   Reflect

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Foul Play

-   Haunter, Level 35. @ Eviolite.

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Will-o-Wisp

    -   Sludge Bomb

-   Clefairy, Level 35. @ Eviolite.

    -   Follow Me

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Icy Wind

    -   Dazzling Gleam

This is a well put together doubles team. Persian will probably hit
first and Marowak will probably hit last and probably knock one of your
mons out, so plan your turn 1 attacks accordingly. Morgrem and Clefairy
are very effective at stalling, but you can try to time knocking them
out so that the screens run out. Haunter and Masquerain hit hard but if
you have set up any of your Pokémon you may be able to succeed!

When you’re back in town, you can proceed to the gym immediately, or go
tackle a side area real fast.

## Mirage Woods - MWoods1

Head back to the top of Route 3 and enter the clearing on the left. Cut
down the trees.

Mirage Woods (Forest Field)

|              |          |
|--------------|----------|
| <u>Grass</u> | <u>%</u> |

| Doduo        | 9        |
| Zangoose     | 1        |

Put the wing we found into the statue.

<u>Ancient Kingdra (Forest Field)</u>

-   Kingdra, Level 38. 2 Shields.

    -   Rain Dance

    -   Snipe Shot

    -   Thunder

    -   Dragon Pulse

This might be a tough one! If you have some way to lower its special
attack do it, though note that Snipe Shot will often crit. Luckily its
first turn and every turn that rain ends it will probably use Rain
Dance, so that’s your chance to mess with it via paralysis or stat
drops. It doesn’t have any way to heal.

Once you succeed, head north across the bridge. Grab the *Telluric Seed*
to the right.

If you enter the left house, there’s a *Steam Ball* on the ground. Talk
to the scientist in the top right, then he’ll let you into the other
buildings. The bottom right building contains an *Itemfinder!* Helpful
to find hidden items. Feel free to use it to find any of the previous
hidden items if you haven’t obtained them yet.

Start using it around the woods. In total, you’ll find: A *Clever Wing,
Repel, Black Flute, Genius Wing, Green Shard, Ether, Zinc, Pretty Wing,*
and *Moomoo Milk.*

If you haven’t yet gotten Flash from the Casino, we’ll need it for the
next quest. Once you have Flash taught to a Pokémon, enter the upper
right house.

ZCell 013: Mirage Cave

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image13.png"
style="width:6.64583in;height:4.97917in" />

Grab the cell and *TM66 Payback*.

Head up and agree to use Flash, and a battle will ensue.

<u>Pokegang Crobat (Cave Field)</u>

-   Zubat, Level 33.

    -   Confuse Ray

    -   Swift

    -   Air Cutter

    -   Acrobatics

-   Zubat, Level 33.

    -   Acrobatics

-   Crobat, Level 48.

    -   Acrobatics

    -   Toxic

    -   Poison Fang

    -   Confuse Ray

A good Rock or Steel type with high defense can effectively wall this
battle. If you manage to win, you’ll get a **Zubat** afterwards!

Once you’re ready, exit to Sheridan village. There’s one more side quest
we can do here. On the south side of town, you’ll see a Sawk and Throh
standing by a woman. After a scene and a fight with a trainer, you’ll
have a chance to catch **Throh!**

Talk to the trucker to head back to Gearen City - we’re going to make a
pitstop with Zumi. For catching Drifloon, she’ll give us 3 *Exp. Candy
M*. Talk to the blue haired girl, then pay to enter the main part of the
library. In the room on the left, talk to the girl in here to do a quiz.
If you answer all the questions correctly, you’ll get a *Thunderstone!*
The answers are brown, Goldenwood, and Goldenleaf.

## Phantasm Badge - Badge04

After you’ve left Narcissa’s house, talk to the Audino breeder next to
the Pokémon Center for a repeatable battle against 3 Audino. Each time
you win, you’ll get *5* *Exp. Candy S*.

Enter the theater and talk to Narcissa

Relationship Point Choices:

- This will work. (Ren +2)

- I'm unsure... (Ren +1)

- It's a stupid idea. (Ren -2)

After learning of your challenge, enter the door on the left.

Backstage Theater (Haunted Field)

|                |          |

| <u>Walking</u> | <u>%</u> |

| **Banette**    | 10       |
| **Yamask**     | 6        |

Yamask and Duskull might be helpful for our upcoming gym battle.

Enter the door on the left, then talk to Mimikyu and read the sign. As
the NPC says outside, follow the lit torches through the dungeon.
Although it may feel like you’re going in circles, just keep following
the torches until you finally pass through a mirror and get to the heal
and PC stars. Head through the door.

Relationship Point Choices:*

    -   Spite

    -   Roost

    -   Steel Wing

    -   Drill Peck

This is an easy battle to be honest. Flash and Dazzling Gleam
temporarily nullify the field if you don’t want to be overwhelmed by his
Ghost and Dark moves. Once you’re done with Ren, say no to his question
for maximum relationship points, then head up and get ready to face
Narcissa.

In the auditorium, head down and grab the items: *Super Potion, Rawst
Berry,* and *Rare Candy.* When you’re ready, take on Narcissa.

<u>Leader Narcissa (Haunted Field over Forest Field)</u>

-   Dusclops, Level 35. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Night Shade

    -   Will-o-Wisp

    -   Spectral Scream

    -   Pain Split

Spectral Scream: Ghost \| Special \| 65 power \| 100% accuracy \| 60%
chance to raise user's Defense by 1 stage \| On Haunted Field, power is
boosted x1.5 \| Turns Blessed Field into Haunted Field.

As you can see, Narcissa’s team is very tanky and will not hesitate to
burn and sleep you to death, so make sure you have counters for these
things in place. Her Mismagius is fast and with the field hits like a
truck, so you must find a way to live a hit. Flame Charge is boosted by
the field and given Ghost sub-typing, so if you use that move it may
allow you to sweep. Alternatively, if you have Flash, use it! It’ll
remove the field for two turns. Just be aware she can turn it back by
using Spectral Scream.

Once you’re done, you’ll get the Phantasm Badge and *TM30 Shadow Ball!*
Now we can level up to 40.

Head into Wispy Ruins.

# Chapter 5: Imprisoned

## Wispy Ruins - WRuins1

And head back out. Now that the people of Goldenleaf have decided to
change their ways, they’ll give us some stuff if we talk to them around
town: a *Super Potion,* a *Revive,* a *Full Heal*, and some *Dusk
Balls!*

Enter the house near the garden and talk to **Snubbull!** The person
will let you have it now that we have 4 badges. Enter the bit of Wispy
Ruins by cutting the tree next to the gym. Step on the tile, then enter
the newly opened 4-badge gate door. Inside the chest is a *Big Nugget*!
Head into the graveyard at the west of town at night with a
GourmetTreat, and you’ll find a **Misdreavus!**

Now, head back into Wispy Ruins. Enter the stairs and watch the scene,
then go up in the cave. After going up again, a couple of Shuppet will
drop you into a pit.

Wispy Chasm (Haunted Field)

|                      |          |

| Linoone (Galarian)   | 1        |
| **Claydol**          | 1        |

Our goal here is to trap all the Shuppet into corners. There’s one in
the southwest - after it moves for the first time, go down, left, down,
up, right, right. Now go up to the west middle area where you’ll see
another. Once it moves for the first time, go down, left, down, then
right until you can’t anymore, then up. Also, grab this *Max Repel*
while you’re here.

Head down from here, hidden is a *Yellow Shard.* You’ll see a
**Phantump** wandering around. It is vital for an event later that you
get a female one here, so reset if it’s not. Head all the way north
afterwards, and past another Phantump, enter the 2-badge gate. In here,
you’ll get a *Dawn Stone!*

Loop back around to the middle, around where the NPC is with the crazy
hair. Head up and to the right and grab the *Cleanse Ta*g, then follow
Shuppet down and up into the middle. Get it to go back through the big
loop counterclockwise, then follow it. It should now be on the upper
path, so follow it right and get it to crawl into the small path in the
middle, then talk to it.

Go up through the center and head left to grab the *Calcium.* Head up
and chase the last Shuppet. For this one, get it to the platform in the
upper left, then to the platform to the right, and down. Talk to it,
then return to the middle of the north side and the Shuppet will let you
pass. Before climbing the ladder, go up and enter the 1-badge gate to
get a *Dusk Stone*! Head up and through the ladder.

ZCell 014: Wispy Ruins

style="width:6.67708in;height:4.97917in" />

Head to the right. I recommend healing sometime soon, there’ll be a few
battles upcoming. Once you’re done, return, then go up. Follow the path
until you reach a larger room. Hop your way past all the rocks on the
right, then you’ll enter a double battle against some Wild Pokémon. This
is an easy fight if you have strong and fast Pokémon.

Proceed to Route 4!

## Route 4 - 4Route1

Welcome to Route 4, a sprawling nature preserve. All over there are
items scattered about, and they refresh once a day. Different items will
be present each day.

There are also Kricketot and Misdreavus in the areas to the north of
where we start at certain times of day.

Talk to Aelita and Nim at the bridge to the south. Cross the bridge to
the north, and Nim will join your party.

You’ll also notice that there are Pidove, Hoothoot, Cubone, as well as
**Flabebe** and **Emolga** in this area!

Interact with the stone den to the right of the bridge for a scene and
to get 5 *Rift Fragments.* These will allow us to catch Shadow Pokémon
from within the dens, when we weaken them to 25% HP. They have shields
like the rifts we’ve fought so far! Not fighting or defeating it gives
250/500 for common/rare dens respectively, while catching gives 500/1000
respectively.

RIFT DEN 1 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
Graveler, Nuzleaf, **Solosis**, and **Tropius**. The rare ones are
Bonsly, Meowth, and Finneon.

Head back to the left and let Cairo break the rock. You’ll get a *Moomoo
Milk.* Head up.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - You okay, Nim? (Aelita +1)  
            - You're acting weird... (Neutral)

RIFT DEN 2 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are
Tranquill, **Wailmer**, Dunsparce, and **Vullaby**. The rare ones are
**Chatot**, Snorunt, and Cacnea.

To the right of here, at night, you’ll find roaming **Wooloo.** To the
right under the bridge, you’ll find that *TM45 Attract* is at the
bottom.

Enter Cairo’s house. He has a shop set up.

<u>Cairo’s Shop (\<8 Badges)</u>

*Joy Scent (10)* $5,000

*Excite Scent (10)* $8,500

*Vivid Scent (10)* $11,000

*Bike Voucher* 250 Red Essences

*Noctowl Crest* 2,000 Red Essences

*Phione Crest* 2,000 Red Essences

*Fragments (5)* $4,956

*Fragments (10)* $14,868

*Fragments (25)* $24,780

Crests are unique held items that give the species in question unique
strengths to make them better. As you can tell from the two on display,
they’re generally given to Pokémon that are otherwise bad. The bottom of
this file has details on what every crest does!

Get the Bike Voucher for now if you want, but otherwise start saving up
Rift Essence. If you accumulate *exactly* 10,000, talk to **Chespin**
and Cairo will let you have it! You can check with the Gather Cube the
exact amount you have.

Head up. There are Duskull roaming here at night. Try to head into Akuwa
Town to the north for a battle with Nim.

<u>Apprentice Nim (Psychic Terrain)</u>

    -   Energy Ball

Our second encounter with Nim sees her Pokémon with much stronger
Pokémon with stronger Psychic attacks, but they’re still no match for a
decent team. Good dark types and Pokémon that resist Psychic and/or Rock
will do well here. Most of her Pokémon are slow and she doesn’t have any
speed control, so if you can outspeed and cripple one or both of her
Pokémon per turn you’ll likely find a way through this one.

Enter Akuwa Town and go with Aelita to the old man. We will explore
Akuwa Town in a bit, but there are some quests we can do! Skip the
following section to proceed through the story.

## Lost Camp Part 1, and Floria Side Quests - LCamp1

Head to the left, and sneak through the gap in the fence. Enter Lost
Camp and talk to Maman. She’ll quest us with finding kids to populate
the camp, and if you talk to her again a few times, to upgrade the land.
The land upgrades total $2500 for the first wave, so do this if you have
the money.

She won’t upgrade further until we’ve found four children - so let’s go
ahead and start finding them. They’re located all over the world map, so
we’ll be taking a brief tour to get them all. A truck driver in Akuwa
Town can take us to the previous towns. Five *lost kids* are reachable
for now:

1.  Andrew can be found in Abandoned Sewers underneath Gearen City by
    crossing the first bridge north, then the first bridge west, then
    the first bridge down in an alcove at the bottom.

2.  James can be found by entering Spring of Purification from Sheridan
    Village. He’s on the right.

3.  Marissa can be found on Wispy Path in the upper right corner of
    where Espurr played with you.

4.  Matthew can be found on Route 3, the second bridge from the bottom.

5.  Cybur can be found on Route 3, next to the mystery egg vendor.

These are the only five we can get before we get a few more HM’s, so
return to the Lost Camp and there’ll be a few new things we can do.

First, Maman will let us donate again. Donate another $2500, and the
camp will be upgraded for a second time! Exit and return.

A few orphans will sell you stuff in camp!

<u>Lost Camp: Andrew Shop</u>

*Pomeg Berry* $600

*Kelpsy Berry* $600

*Qualot Berry* $600

*Hondew Berry* $600

*Grepa Berry* $600

*Tamato Berry* $600

<u>Lost Camp: Matthew Shop</u>

*Water Stone* $2,100

*Fire Stone* $2,100

*Leaf Stone* $2,100

As an aside, if you want quick AP, we can use Matthew’s stones to fill
out a lot of categories Fill up a team with Pickup mons (pickup points),
then catch lots of Pansage/Pansear/Panpour (catching points).
Alternatively, breed them (egg hatching points and walking around
points). Catch any shinies you find as well (catch shiny points). Then,
using money you’ve gotten from selling Pickup items (selling points),
buy stones from Matthew (buying points) and use them to evolve each of
your monkeys. (evolution points and evolve-by-stone points).

Return to Gearen City, and exchange the Bike Voucher for a *Bicycle!*
Gotta go fast.

I recommend also at this point buying the Golden Surfboard and, if you
have the AP, the Golden Claws. We won’t be able to come back here for a
little while after getting surf, so if you don’t want to burden your
party, get the surfboard now.

Level up Slugma to Level 38 to get **Magcargo.** Add it and Emolga to
your party, then head back to Route 2’s trailer to get *Charcoal* and
*Magnet,* as well as *TM96 Nature Power!*

## Mystery Egg - MEgg1

There’s one more quest we can do. This will get us a very strong
Pokémon, but if you’re not interested, go ahead and skip to the Route 4
section.

Go back through Wispy Ruins to Goldenleaf Town, then take the truck to
get to Sheridan Village. We’re gonna take the female Phantump we caught
and breed it at the day care. Of what we have, male Cacnea, Oddish,
Bellsprout, Sunkern, Cherubi, Slugma, and Shuppet are all good choices
for partners if you have them. Once you get a Phantump egg, make sure it
doesn’t hatch, and walk to Route 3.

This will only work during the daytime, but return to the Route 3
market, and talk to the boy in front of the old man. He’ll offer you a
trade of the mystery egg he just got for your Phantump egg.

The mystery egg is unfortunately determined as you start your save file,
so it cannot be re-determined by save resetting. Anyways, the mystery
egg will be one of these Pokémon: **Azurill, Aron, Absol, Togepi,
Sneasel, Dhelmise, Aevian Litwick, Axew, Mienfoo, Pawniard, Trapinch,
Mudbray, Cottonee, Darumaka, Hatenna, Starly, Tyrunt, Larvesta,
Mareanie, Stufful, Rookidee.** These will all be available at some point
later in the game (though not necessarily this version), so don’t fret
if you don’t get your favorite right now.

For now, head back to Route 4 through Wispy Path.

## Akuwa Town? - AkuwaT1

Now we can explore Akuwa Town a bit. Itemfinder at the entrance to the
town will get you a *Super Repel.* There’s an egg in the bottom right
corner of town. Once it hatches, you’ll get **Ducklett!** There’s also
wild Pokémon in the grass.

Akuwa Town

Head up to the gym area, but before you go in, directly head east.
Behind a tree you’ll find Jessibelle, the sixth of nine *lost kids* who
you can send to the lost camp. To the left of the gym is a *Modest
Mint.*

Enter the house to the north of the trucker:

ZCell 015: Akuwa Town

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image15.png"
style="width:6.63542in;height:5.03125in" />

Talk to Aelita and then enter the Pokémon Center and go to the back to
get a *Defibrillator,* then use it on the old guy. Head down to the
beach area -- here you’ll be able to fight wild **Corsola.** You’ll also
find *TM135 Brine.* Hidden on the beach is a *Soda Pop.*

Head up and up the ladder you’ll see here and grab:

ZCell 016: Akuwa Town (ignore the Ditto!)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image16.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.04167in" />

At this point we will not be able to come back for a bit, so make sure
you’re ready with all the Pokémon you want to catch on this island for
now, and every quest you wanted to finish.

Once you’re ready, head into the Aquarium/gym and go into the backroom.
You don’

## Blacksteeple Castle - BCastle1

Blacksteeple is one of my favorite sections of this game, but its very
story driven and has relatively few battles, items, wild Pokémon and the
like. I’ll be telegraphing every move you must do during this part of
the game, but I also do believe it’s more fun to play this part without
referencing any guide unless you get stuck. We won’t be able to come
back later (at least in this version), so it might be a good idea to
scan this section after you’re done to ensure you don’t miss anything.
As a note - the outdoor section in the middle will be referred to as the
courtyard, the east section will be the quarry, and the left section
will be the fields.

### Day 1

We’ll wake up in the cells. Go to sleep.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - How did you? (Neutral)  
            - You know, the usual. (Saki +1)

Exit the only way you can, then make your way outside and to the east to
the quarry. Head down into the mines and talk to Saki.

Accept the fast travel, then talk to everyone in the mine. Once you do,
the bottom area will open. Beat the trainer, then head to the sigil at
the top of the mine.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - Where's Aelita? (Neutral)  
            - Are we done here? (Aelita -1)

Exit Neved’s office and head back down the stairs and head all the way
up into the colorful door. Talk to the crew, then exit the room. If you
go into the battle room and exit to the right, you can access some grass
with wild Pokémon.

Blacksteeple Castle

|               |          |
|---------------|----------|
| <u>Grass</u>  | <u>%</u> |
| **Tangela**   | 45       |
| **Teddiursa** | 25       |
| **Cramorant** | 15       |
| **Abomasnow** | 4        |
| **Ursaring**  | 4        |
| **Delibird**  | 2        |

I recommend catching everything here, in particular Cramorant, who we
can’t get later on.

Head back to your bed and get some sleep.

### Day 2

Head on out and talk to the crew. Enter the door in the southwest
corner, talk to the left guard to access the shop.

<u>Blacksteeple Castle Shop</u>

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Ultra Ball* $1,200

*Super Potion* $700

*GourmetTreat* $1,500

*Repel* $350

*Super Repel* $500

*Escape Rope* $550

Talk to the right guard, then head into the courtyard. On the right-side
upper level, you’ll find a kid, battle him to get the *Mining Kit.*

Enter the quarry again and talk to Adam.

Relationship Point Choices:

- I won it. (Neutral)

- I stole it. (Adam -1)

All those glowing rocks around can be mined for items, just like in 4th
gen. The item probabilities within are as follows:

Mining Probabilities

| *Splash Plate*   | 0.3%          |
| *Pixie Plate*    | 0.3%          |

These items can be nice to pick up, but you’ll be able to get them all
over the story so don’t stress too much right now. Once we can revive
fossils, I will mention them all at once, but feel free to mine at your
leisure. If you save in front of a rock and press F12, you can reset the
items within.

Break all the rocks, talk to Adam, and use the *Blast Powder* he gives
you. Head left and talk to him again.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Calm down. (Adam +1)  
            - You're useless! (Adam -2)

Beat the trainer. After all that, head into the battle room.

### Night 2

Now you’ll control Emma for a bit. Make your way through the path and
all the way to the right. After the first minecart goes, head left and
up the hill to talk to a robot for a battle. Push it into its spot, then
repeat with the robot to the left. Finally fly over the pit at the
bottom and fight the third robot and push it into its place.

Head into this room, then interact with the computer.

### Day 3

Head out and watch all the scenes. When you regain control, it’s time
for 3v3 battles in the battle room. The first two are easy, however the
last is against Emma.

<u>Hooded Girl Emma (No Field)</u>

-   Zoroark, Level 37.

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Grass Knot

-   Gardevoir, Level 38.

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Psychic

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Calm Mind

-   Meganium, Level 38.

    -   Nature Power

    -   Magical Leaf

    -   Leech Seed

    -   Poison Powder

These three can all be threatening in their own way but choosing the
right three will net you the victory easily.

Next, enter the library on top of the stairs, and read the purple
bookshelf. Then head to the garden area to the left of the courtyard. Go
up at the tree at the top, to reach a secret area.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - It was barely a riddle. (Neutral)  
            - I was stumped. (Saki +1)

Enter the hut to talk to the crew.

Back in the garden, walk up the stairs on the right to interact with the
crew by the sigil. Then reenter the castle and talk to Valarie at the
dining hall.

### Night 3

In the prestige room, talk to the candelabra then the bookshelf.

Next, you’ll play as Emma again. Head to the battleship first. Then
sneak your way through the courtyard and then the castle to reach the
third floor. Enter Neved’s room, then the room to the right.

Back outside enter the library and talk to the wide blue bookshelf on
the left. Then talk to the bookshelf in the middle, then beat the
trainer.

### Day 4

There’s an impossible battle coming up as soon as we do the next
cutscene, so make sure if you want to win add Fletchling with Quick
Guard to your party.

Enter the secret garden area again and enter the hut. After a lot of
scenes, head back to the secret garden and down the stairs. Push through
the false wall, then again on the right.

Relationship Point Choices:

- We're getting out. (PianoLady +2)

- I'm here to help. (PianoLady +1)

- We're screwed. (PianoLady -1)

Go right and up.

<u>Xen Executive Madelis (Cave Field)</u>

-   Cinccino, Level 36.

    -   Bullet Seed

    -   Rock Blast

    -   Tail Slap

    -   Encore

-   Tsareena, Level 37.

    -   Trop Kick

    -   Bounce

    -   Nature Power

    -   Low Sweep

-   Sharpedo, Level 38. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Bounce

    -   Crunch

    -   Psychic Fangs

    -   Waterfall

-   Florges, Level 37.

    -   Nature Power

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Synthesis

    -   Giga Drain

-   Salazzle, Level 37.

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Foul Play

    -   Toxic

-   Houndoom, Level 39. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Nasty Plot

    -   Sludge Bomb

Be wary of Cinccino, as its 5-hit rock blast is boosted by the cave and
tail slap hits hard. Her Houndoom and Salazzle can hit hard but if you
can shut them down with a strong Rock or Water type, you’ll be ok.

Outside, Nancy will join up with you! Beat the guards as you go. She has
a Level 65 Sylveon (!) so you shouldn’t have to worry much. Once you get
to the courtyard, head back up to Neved’s office.

Relationship Point Choices:

- Are you okay? (Aelita +3)

- I looked for you... (Aelita +2)

- We gotta get to the top! (Aelita +1)

- No time to catch up! (Aelita -1

Follow the stairs all the way up and prepare for battle. Aelita will
join your party for this one.

<u>Xen Executive Neved (No Field)</u>

-   Crabominable, Level 41. @ Occa Berry.

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Drain Punch

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Crabhammer

-   Tentacruel, Level 41. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Blizzard

    -   Scald

-   Vikavolt, Level 42.

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Bug Buzz

    -   Air Slash

    -   Thunder Wave

-   Manectric, Level 43. @ Magnet.

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Hidden Power Ice

    -   Volt Switch

    -   Flamethrower

-   Aevian Palossand, Level 44. @ Never Melt Ice.

    -   Ice Beam

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Moonlight

-   Barbaracle, Level 45. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   X-Scissor

    -   Night Slash

    -   Razor Shell

    -   Rock Slide

Neved has a team that’s entirely above your level cap, but you also get
to effectively 12 on 6 him with Aelita on your side, so it’s not too
tough of a fight. Manectric is insanely fast and likes to one-shot
Aelita’s Pokémon, so take it out quickly if you can. Crippling
Crabominable with a burn or attack lower might be a good strategy while
you clean up the left side. Watch out for Barbaracle too which hits
surprisingly hard. Anyways, just keep up the pressure and make sure the
fastest mons is out, then you and Aelita should be able to win.

Well….

<u>Madame X (No Field)</u>

-   Yveltal, Level 100. @ Soul Stone.

    -   Decimation

This is one of those ‘impossible’ RPG battles. Ultimately, you’re
supposed to lose this one obviously, but if you’re crafty, the game will
acknowledge your victory should you manage to succeed with +1 Karma.

Decimation is a priority move, but it ignores abilities. Hence, we have
to use Quick Guard! Decimation has 20 PP and Quick Guard starts with 15.
TWO Pokémon with Quick Guard can drain its PP with Quick Guard, then
watch it struggle to death!

Whether you win or lose, watch the next scenes play out.

Relationship Point Choices:

- You came to save me? (Neutral)

- Thank you... (Neutral)

- I could've done it myself. (Aelita -1)

Goodbye Blacksteeple Castle!

## Xen Battleship - XShip1

We’ll wake up on the ship with Adam.

Relationship Point Choices:

Your *Snag Machine* will finally be fixed! Reenter the interior and head
down the stairs to the right to grab the *Dull Key!* We’ll be using this
a bit later.

There’s also the Akuwa town merchant here:

Melia has added three more Pokémon since last time, but her team is
nothing too much for us, especially after Madelis and Neved.

After you win, head out to the deck and talk to Melia again.

## Terajuma Shore - TShore1

Once you beach, you’ll have to battle two rangers. Winning grants +3
Melia relationship points, while losing takes away -3 Melia relationship
points.

Back on the ship, head up the two ladders to reach *TM136 Assurance.*
Head down from the ship, and you’ll see a **Pyukumuku** on the shore.

boat us back to Gearen City for a price - a way to go free will open up
a bit after the upcoming gym fight, so I would recommend waiting unless
you need something from Floria Island for the fight.

When you’re ready, head into Terajuma Jungle to the north.

There are also Hoppip flying around in the mornings. Via itemfinder, on
the right side pick up a *Sitrus Berry.* Towards the left is a *Fire
Gem.*

Once you’ve gotten a feel for the middle area, talk to the group of your
friends, specifically Melia, on the left side. We’re going to have to
take the long way, so head into the left path and into the cave.

Relationship Point Choices:

- Four, is that enough? (Melia +1)

- What’s a badge? (Melia +2)

- Can't I just swim? (Valarie +1)

After a brief conversation there’s just one thing left to do for this
section!

## Dewdrop Badge - Badge05

Once you’ve healed, talk to Valarie outside for her gym battle.

<u>Water Show Performer Valarie (Water Surface)</u>

-   Qwilfish, Level 38. @ Poison Barb.

    -   Waterfall

    -   Poison Jab

    -   Aquabatics

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Ice Beam

Aquabatics: Water \| Status \| Raises the user's Special Attack and
Speed by 1 stage each.

So, this is the first *hard* gym battle, at least from my experience.
Ground moves do nothing (even Mud Bomb/High Horsepower for some reason),
so for Qwilfish and Lanturn you have to think of something else. Her
Qwilfish and Floatzel have Swift Swim, so they will normally outspeed
you and hit hard. Lanturn and Primarina are a bit slower but if you let
them get off Aquabatics (special Dragon Dance) then they can steamroll
your team. Watch out for Dewgong, too, whose Hydration ability allows it
to heal all the way up to full every turn with Rest. If you can get past
the first two fast attackers though, a strong physical set up sweeper
might be able to get through the rest of her team. An alternative is to
transform the field: 2 uses of Sludge Wave turns it into Murkwater,
which takes away some of her advantages and can help a Poison-type
oriented team, though she can turn it back with Lanturn and Dewgong’s
Whirlpool.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - You're strong... (Neutral)  
            - It was pretty even. (Neutral)  
            - Ez. (Valarie -2)

# Chapter 6: Nimpossible Predicament

## Terajuma Island Surfing - TISurf1

Head back to where you had the battle, then talk to Melia to get *HM03
Surf!*

First thing’s first: we can now explore all the bodies of water we want
with Surf. There’re just a few things we can do on the pier and shore
areas, then we’ll continue in the jungle.

Start back at the first island map, where the shop is.

| Carvanha       | 1        |

Surf up to the top on the right side. Itemfind for a *Blue Shard.*

ZCell 017: Terajuma Island

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image17.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.02083in" />

Surf up at the bridge, on the left of the fence. Itemfinder points us to
a *Lemonade.* We can’t do anything with the house, so head west one
screen to Terajuma Pier.

Go all the way to the left, then down. Surf down from here. Grab the
*Red Shard.* Afterwards, return to the jungle.

Once you’re ready, enter Jirukala Cavern and surf around. On the right,
a rock will hide a *Rock Gem*. We can’t rock climb yet, so exit to the
left. Go down and left.

After the scene, grab the 3 *Oran Berries,* and the *Dusk Ball.*

Once you go inside the ranger station, meet with the group to the right.
Head back out, then go up at the first place you can. This map has a
slightly different set of encounters to that we’ve already seen.

Cross the bridge to the right, then head down to grab a *Full Heal.* Go
all the way up to Melia. You’ll then have to battle the Carnivine,
though you can’t catch it. Outcomes give Relationship Points: winning
grants +1 Melia, losing grants -1 Melia, running grants -2 Melia.

Follow her to the right. Itemfind for a *TinyMushroom* and grab the
*Sitrus Berries* and *Oran Berries.* Save/heal before you head right,
because a cutscene is about to take us into a battle!

<u>Xen Executive Geara (Forest Field)</u>

-   Persian, Level 41. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Night Slash

    -   Return

    -   Fake Out

-   Gengar, Level 43. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Sludge Wave

How did Geara level up/evolve his Pokémon in the altered dimension and
get a Krookodile? Who knows? Anyways, this is a tough fight for sure,
especially as he uses the field well. His Krookodile and Persian each
have boosted Grass moves, so be careful to not send in slower water
types. Marowak and Grimmsnarl can be pains if you let them set up, so
setting up rocks can help tremendously here. Overpower him with stronger
mons that counter his and you’ll be fine.

As soon as you’re done, we’re back in a rift. Grab the *Rift Notes: Code
Sarpa*. Heal and switch out your party, grab the pulse notes, and get
ready.

<u>Dimensional Rift Carnivine (Rift Field)</u>

-   Carnivine, Level 45. @ Yache Berry. Type: Grass/Dragon. Stats:
    80/110/75/120/100/115. Ability: Thick Fat. 2 Shields.

    -   Coil

    -   Power Whip

    -   Gunk Shot

    -   Dragon Rush

Another battle with a Rift. This one tries to wear you down with Coil
boosts, so burning or otherwise keeping its attack low will be useful.
Wear it down defensively before too many Coils or switch to special
moves if you must. Even with its ability Ice moves are good, as are Bug,
Flying, Dragon, Fairy.

Enter the house here and grab the *Focus Band.* I recommend adding it to
something on your team that isn’t holding an item - might as well give
your team an extra edge. Outside hidden is a *TinyMushroom.*

Exit and go to the right. Go down, as we can explore this upper area.
Itemfind for a *Great Ball, Wacan Berry,* and pick up:

ZCell 018: Terajuma Jungle

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image18.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.01042in" />

On the right you’ll find a *Brave Mint* as well as a hidden *Super
Repel.*

Exit north to Kakori Village.

Talk to the characters at the village. You’ll get a +1 Melia
Relationship Point if you’ve already helped take out Rift Gyarados in
Goldenwood Forest for the second time.

This moment clears some of the vines in the jungle, so we’re going to
head back down to grab a few things quick. If you don’t want to catch
more Pokémon or get some items, jump to the next section now.

Before we start, grab a Dunsparce from the Pokémon Center PC.

Re-enter the forest and talk to the first girl from the top. She’ll tell
you she wants someone to watch her Growlithe. Like Espurr, we’re gonna
need to get some affection with it. The fastest way to do it is to talk
to Aelita below:

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Join me! (Aelita +1)  
            - Nope. (Neutral)

Then, play ball with her and Growlithe… 31 times. Once you’ve done this,
tell it to follow you, then try to leave the forest to the north and
you’ll get **Growlithe!** (+1 Karma)

Head left a map and enter the Weather Institute. The guy in the top
right will trade for your Dunsparce a **Castform!** You can do this
infinitely if you want, in fact.

Head back out and go down. Here you’ll see a **Vileplume** in the
ground. Sprinkle the Spice Powder on it, and it will attack. Itemfind
for a *TinyMushroom,* then cross the bridge to get 3 *Leppa Berries,* 3
*Pecha Berries,* a *Tanga Berry,* and *Blast Powder.* Save this one!

Head left a map, then go down. After taking out another Vileplume with
Spice Powder, you’ll have access to *Quick Powder* and another cell.

ZCell 019: Deep Terajuma Jungle

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image19.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.01042in" />

Head up then all the way left. On the bridge, a girl will get upset at
you and request 20 Sitrus Berries. We will be able to buy them in a
little bit. Make your way to the northwest side of this map, get the
hidden *Bug Gem,* then go into the clearing.

Just like the Pom-Pom Meadow back in Floria, here’s another meadow with
another form of Oricorio to be found.

Hula Meadow

|                     |          |
|---------------------|----------|
| <u>Grass</u>        | <u>%</u> |

| Grubbin             | 1        |
| **Oranguru**        | 1        |

Grab two Oranguru if you can - one will be traded away later. In the
pot, you can find infinite *Pink Nectar.* That’s all we can do here, so
head back to the jungle. There’s still one thing left to do before we
proceed into the village… bet you weren’t expecting a legendary Pokémon
so early, were you?

Exit the jungle south to return to the pier. At nighttime, Surf in the
bottom section of this area, and you’ll be able to interact with wild
**Phione** for a GourmetTreat! Return to the village to progress the
story.

## Kakori Village and Jeminra Woods - KVill1

In the town, itemfind around for 2 *TinyMushrooms.* In the top left, use
another Spice Powder on Vileplume to get to a hidden… *TinyMushroom.*

Enter the third house from the left, on the upper row of houses below
the cliffside. Talk to the woman, and she’ll run off to the Xen
Battleship. We’ll get to her once we have an easier way to get to the
pier from here.

<u>Kakori Village Pokemart</u>

*Super Repel* $500

*Ice Heal* $250

*Burn Heal* $250

*Paralyze Heal* $200

*Escape Rope* $550

*Spice Powder* $850

Also, in the mart, if you’d like, trade in your Up-Grade with a girl to
get *Scope Lens!* We’ll get another Up-Grade shortly, so don’t worry
about this one.

There’s an entrance to the Safari Zone in the northeast side of town, so
go ahead and enter for $3,500.

You’ll get 800 steps and 30 Poke Balls per run. I recommend grabbing a
Level 35-38 Pokémon and a lot of repels - most of the 1% encounter
Pokémon (not Wobbuffet, though) are higher level than the rest, so you
can parse for them via repels.

Get two Spinda - we will be trading one away later.

You can also find: a *Rare Candy,* a *Reverse Candy, Hyper Potion,
TinyMushroom, Super Repel, Friend Ball* in this area. We can’t access
the island to the east yet, but there’s one more area we can reach for
now.

Use the Spice Powder on the Vileplume in Area 5, then follow the path up
and right across the rocks.

We can’t battle our Pokémon yet, therefore, we can’t purify this cave
quite yet. We’ll get back to it. That’s about all we can do here.

Back at the gate, if you managed to survive the suffering and find a
Chansey, show it to the girl for the *Oval Charm!* This will help us
find eggs in the day care more often.

We actually have access to Route 6’s grass at this point, west of
Kakori. There is also a hidden *Star Piece* out here.

Synthesis 3 Green Shards

Talk to the guy in the top right and give him 5 Oran Berries to get the
*Wailmer Pail!*

Enter the hallway at the top. In the community rec room, a girl will
give you a *Weakness Policy*. In the room above that, grab the
*Up-Grade* then talk to the girl in the corner.

If you’ve done all the other virtual badge battles, she’ll let us
continue the quest.

<u>Gym Leader Chuck (Glitch Field)</u>

    -   Focus Blast

    -   Waterfall

    -   Hypnosis

If you’ve chosen Quilava, switch right away for Steelix: one Curse and
one Gyro Ball should be able to outplay Primeape. On Poliwrath you want
to get Qwilfish in for Toxic Spikes, then let Jolteon finish it off.
Steelix and Quilava should be able to handle the rest!

Talk to her again to take on Jasmine.

-   Magneton, Level 36.

Immediately switching to Steelix to get off some curses will easily get
you through Magneton 1 and Skarmory - then you should switch to eat the
HP Fire. Knock out Magneton 2 with Miltank and Qwilfish, then let
Qwilfish go off on Steelix. This should leave Typhlosion to finish
Steelix and one shot Scizor, despite the Occa Berry. Once you win,
you’ll get the sixth *Virtual Badge.*

In the third room from the right in the hallway, grab the *Escape Rope.*

In the upper hallway, head left, and you’ll go through a cutscene with
Melia (+2 Melia Relationship Points, +2 Aelita). Return to the HQ and
enter the last room on the left. After that, head back outside and go to
Route 5.

This is an easy battle compared to Valarie. That said, watch out for
Type: Null, who can live thanks to Eviolite and set up to hit you hard.
Also, potentially threatening is Typhlosion, whose Nature Power turns
into a +3 Attack Meditate.

After the battle, head up.

Head up to Valor Mountain and watch the scene.

## Dexoy Attack - Dexoy1

You’ll be placed back in Terajuma Jungle, so return to the south
entrance.

We’re gonna be battling some “Dexoys” here, which are Level 45 Deoxys
with Thunderbolt, Psychic, Shadow Ball, and Flash Cannon. Obviously,
they’re tough to take out, but in a pinch, you can find a strategy. Head
to the west first, then the east.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - I'm alright. (Melia +2)  
            - Could be worse. (Melia +1)  
            - Terrible. (Neutral)

Relationship Point Choices:

            - So.. We're on our own? (Melia +1)  
            - Well, that sucks... (Neutral)  
            - Can we ask again? (Melia +2)

Enter the room to the left.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Get me out. (Melia +1)  
            - I have a Relic to get. (Neutral)  
            - A + A = B - B + 3. (Venam +2)

Now is a good time to do the help quests.

## Kakori Help Quests - KakHelp1

<u>HQuest 13: Clear the Way!!</u>

Enter Terajuma Jungle and head south onto the hill and talk to the
hiker. We’re gonna need to find 7 black shards around the forest.

1.  Immediately right of the hiker

2.  In the map to the left, next to the stacks of wood by the Timburr

3.  Heading left across the bridge and to the left, north by the broken
    bridge

4.  South -\> west -\> north across the bridges from \#3

5.  North from \#4, in the meadow.

6.  In the bottom left side of the map where you fought Valarie

7.  Near the water at the bottom side of the entrance map

After you’ve gotten them, head back to the hiker. He’s now cleared the
vines, so you can progress through the jungle easier!

Head into the cave in the water below, which is now opened. Grab the
*TM51 Steel Wing* and *Blast Powder.*

Return to the help center to get $4,326! (+1 Karma)

<u>HQuest 14: Bandit at Large</u>

-   Head to the weather institute in the jungle. Talk to the girl near
    the Venusaur on the left.

-   Head to Route 5 and enter the empty shack on Valor Shore.

-   We’re gonna need to find the Xen grunt hiding on each floor.

-   1F: In the middle stack of books

-   2F: In the box in the upper right corner

-   2F (#2): In the books in the center

-   3F: In the trash can on the top

-   3F (#2): In the horizontal lines of the bottom right big machine

-   3F (#3): In the pot on the top left

-   On the fourth level, grab the *Good Rod!*

-   Talk to her on the fourth level, and you’ll have to battle. You’ll
    be taken back to the weather institute.

-   Head back to Route 5 and all the way down to pick up another *Blast
    Powder.*

-   Return to the help center to get a **Bulbasaur** egg, a *Rare
    Candy,* and $5,000! (+1 Karma)

<u>HQuest 15: Building Bridges</u>

Head to the lumber yard in Terajuma Jungle and enter the building. Talk
to the guy on the right, then Gurdurr. Head west to the bridge, and
we’ll have to battle.

<u>PokeGang Conkeldurr (Forest Field)</u>

-   Timburr, Level 25.

-   Timburr, Level 35.

-   Timburr, Level 45.

-   Timburr, Level 55.

-   Timburr, Level 65.

-   Conkeldurr, Level 75.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Brick Break

    -   Thunder Punch

This is another double battle with one tough enemy at the very end.
Luckily, even at level 75 all the enemies are somewhat slow, so if you
can boost your offenses with a somewhat fast mon you might be able to
one shot it with something super effective. You can use the easy first
two Timburr as an excuse to set up a lot of entry hazards and/or set up
with moves like Dragon Dance. Either way, come up with a strategy to
take it out.

-   Once you win, head west and go up to the broken bridge.

-   Enter, then catch **Rowlet** in there. This is also where the Mossy
    Rock is located. Hidden is a *Red Shard* as well.

-   Return to the help center to get $4,890 and a *Sun Stone!* (+1
    Karma)

<u>HQuest 16: Find It!</u>

-   Head to the ranger shack in the southwest corner of the jungle. Talk
    to Roggenrola, and it will follow you.

-   Exit the jungle towards Kakori, fighting AA Grunts along the way

-   Heal at the Kakori Pokémon center, then talk to the guy in the top
    left.

-   After one battle, return to the help center to get $4,255. (+1
    Karma)

<u>HQuest 17: Battle Me Again!</u>

Time for another battle with Novae. Get your best team and head to the
Valor Shore.

<u>Wanderer Novae (Ashen Beach)</u>

-   Toucannon, Level 42. @ Yache Berry.

    -   Beak Blast

    -   Roost

    -   Bullet Seed

    -   Rock Blast

-   Vikavolt, Level 43. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Bug Buzz

    -   Air Slash

    -   Roost

-   Lycanroc, Level 45. @ Rock Gem.

    -   Stone Edge

    -   Crunch

    -   Accelerock

    -   Drill Run

-   Tsareena, Level 43. @ Grass Gem.

    -   Trop Kick

    -   Knock Off

    -   Play Rough

    -   Acrobatics

-   Palossand, Level 43. @ Leftovers.

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Shore Up

    -   Earth Power

    -   Giga Drain

-   Passimian, Level 45. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Iron Head

    -   Close Combat

    -   Brutal Swing

    -   Bulk Up

This is the hardest battle of hers yet. Almost all her Pokémon have
coverage out the wazoo! Passimian can hit hard if given the chance to
bulk up even once, and Vikavolt takes lives if you let it attack. Not to
mention speed demon Lycanroc probably able to take out at least one of
your team members at will. Not a ton of synergy or a central strategy
though. As before getting a team with near perfect synergy that counters
each of her mons and you might sneak out a victory. You can also wait
till the next level cap if you want to make this one easier.

Anyways, return to the help center to get $4,500, 10 *Reverse Candies,*
10 *Max Repels,* and 10 *Super Potions.* (+1 Karma)

If you’ve done all the help quests, your reward is access to the safari
zone garden. We’ll get this to a bit. Enter the door that the AA grunt
came out of.

You’ll be entered into a 6v6 double battle, but if you can take Novae
you should be able to handle this one. Grab the *TM57 Charge Beam* and
the *Center Keys* here, as well as an *Exp. Candy M.*

That’s it for the help quests.

Now, one more quest we can do. Enter the Xen Battleship, and the girl
from earlier will be here. Talk to her, and she’ll run to the deck.
After you talk to her again, she’ll go into the main room. Finally,
follow her to the very top through Augustus’ room. That’s all we can do
here for now, so back in Kakori, enter the house of the girl who we took
to the boat, and she’ll give you a *Destiny Knot.*

Now that we have the Good Rod, there are a couple new Pokémon we can
obtain in these areas.

We’re now gonna go find Rorim B.

You can do it! Get the *Sky Relic.*

Accept the fast travel. Talk to Rorim B, and he’ll take you to the

If it is raining outside, you can find stationary Gastrodon to fight.
Note that you can also find many *Absorb Bulbs* by interacting with them
in this area.

A *Dusk Ball, Revive,* and a *Pearl* are hidden on the first island.

To the right, you’ll see a brown book on the ground. If you gave away
your *Ancient Book*, here’s where you can get a new one. Otherwise,
leave it here for now.

Maneuver up on the first island to where you can access the water from
two points. We can’t do anything from the left yet, so surf up from the
right. Head to the right island and cut the tree, accessing the water on
the north side of this island. Head up to the next and talk to Melia.

Surf west from here and grab the *Pretty Wing.* Head up and enter the
lab.

After a cutscene, head to the west. We must do an arrow puzzle.

<u>Room 1</u>

-   Take the left upwards arrow above Aelita

-   Head up and take the rightwards arrow.

-   Head down to the downwards facing arrow

-   Fight a trainer with a shadow **Masquerain,** so catch it if you
    can.

-   Press the panel.

<u>Room 2</u>

-   Press the green panel

-   Surf to the up right

-   Go up on the upwards arrow

-   Take the upwards arrow in the upper left

-   Press the panel here

-   Enter the rightmost downward arrow

-   Take the bottom left downward arrow

-   Go up one tile, then right. You’ll fight a trainer with a shadow
    Baltoy.

-   Return to the bottom, then get back to this area. Instead, take the
    upward arrow to the left of the trainer.

-   Leave the blue panel alone, and head up

-   Press the purple panel then take the rightward arrow

-   Ignore this pink panel and go down

-   Press the orange panel

-   Go up onto the leftward arrows onto the pink -\> blue -\> orange
    path and we’re done!

There are Pokémon in here.

-   Take the left upwards arrow that takes you to the left

-   Activate the pink panel and fight the grunt

-   Head down and activate the blue panel.

-   Head right, up and right, then up and right to get to *TM73 Thunder
    Wave!*

-   Head back down, left, left up, and from here return to the upper
    left region as we’ve done before

-   Instead, take the upper right upwards arrow that leads to the upper
    right.

-   Take the rightwards arrow that takes you through the pink path and
    we’re out.

Heal, and we’re going to fight in the next room.

Another tough battle with Ren - his team is almost fully complete, with
only Scyther left to evolve. His team, or at least the last four
members, are extremely fast, so you must find mons that can live his
attacks and dish it back. Cacturne likes to lay spikes. Be careful of
technician Scyther which can hit hard, and protean Greninja as always.

Afterwards, enter the hidden cave. After a cutscene, we’ll be taken back
out to the entrance of the forest. Accept the fast travel to head back
to Kakori.

Rorim B will now take us to Oceana Pier from Terajuma Shore for free, so
now is a good time to return.

## Floria Island Surfing and Side Quests - FlorSurf1

Talk to Rorim B at Terajuma Pier, and you can return to Oceana Pier.

Talk to Dragonite in Oceana Pier. He’s lost some letters, so we’re going
to help pick them up for it. The first is immediately up and left from
it. The second is left behind some trees. The third is in the upper left
corner between some dumpsters. Give them back to get a *Thunderstone!*

Talk to the woman with the cart by the Gearen City Entrance. She’ll
offer you a *Link Heart* for $10,000. This will evolve a trade evolution
for us, so I recommend grabbing it now.

Enter the Magnolia Library and talk to Zumi upstairs to get our next
quest. She’s looking for Pyukumuku, which we already have. She’ll give
us 6 *Exp. Candy M.* Our next quest is for Mareep!

The Shopping Emporium has new wares for us now that we have five badges:

<u>Poke Ball Emporium New Items (5 Badges)</u>

*Timer Ball* $1,000

*Dive Ball* $1,000

<u>Berry Emporium New Item (5 Badges)</u>

*Sitrus Berry* $750

Buy 20 of these to give to the girl on the bridge if you’d like.

Next, head to the basement of Chrisola hotel. Surf to the dark patch in
the water at night and use a GourmetTreat to get **Totodile!** Also,
grab the *Water Stone.*

There are also a couple new items in the AP shop.

<u>AP Shop New Items (5 Badges)</u>

Head up, and you’ll get *Berry Ice Cream* from Karen. *TM118 Pin
Missile* is here as well. The area beyond is Wispy Ruins, but we can’t
explore much as we don’t have Rock Climb yet. Return to the town.

Talk to Dragonite in the square - it’s lost its letters again!

The first is south of the pair of houses, in the southwest corner of the
town. The second letter is on the hill south of the cemetery. The third
is in the grass area at the bottom. Finally, the fourth on the hill to
the right of Narcissa’s house. Once we have all four, talk to Dragonite
to get *TM113 Brutal Swing!*

out of here to the north to return to Goldenleaf Town and take the truck
to Akuwa Town.

## Route 4 Second Visit - 4Route2

Enter Route 4 from Akuwa Town.

Head all the way to the entrance by Wispy Ruins. Surf up at the top of
the mountain: you’ll find Teddy here, the eighth of the nine *lost kids*
for the Lost Camp side quest. There is also another den here!

RIFT DEN 3 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are
Herdier, Crabrawler, Pachirisu, and Chimecho. The rare ones are

fourth den.

RIFT DEN 4 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are
Lotad, Gastrodon, and Palpitoad. The rare ones are Mantyke and

That’s all that we can do here for now. You might have enough Rift
Essence to grab those crests if you haven’t gotten them yet.

Head back to Akuwa Town.

## Route 11 - 11Route1

| Alomomola    | 1        |                 |     |

There’s nothing to do in Akuwa Town yet, as all the people are still
gone. Surf east, as you do, pick up hidden *Blast Powder, Poke Ball,
Health Wing* on the islands. First, surf east to Route 11.

Route 11

| Binacle           | 5        |                 |          |

Hidden on the first island is a *Dire Hit.* Grab the *Red Shard*, then
talk to the Xen Grunt… He wants 10 Sweet Hearts. Buy them from the Route
3 Vendor if you haven’t yet, then return.

Beat the grunt, and you’ll be engaged in battle with a level 40
**Jynx!**

Starting to the south, use your itemfinder on the islands to find *HP
Up, Adamint Mint, Red Shard, Blue Shard, Jolly Mint.* Pick up the
*Ether.* To the right, you’ll find Poliwag \#3!

On the island south of here, you’ll find

ZCell 028: Route 11

style="width:6.57292in;height:4.91667in" />

Anyways, grab the *Max Repel* and enter the cave on the east side here.

Seabound Cave/Evergreen Cave

Catch two Sandshrew here, we are gonna trade one away in a bit. The
water encounters we can access in just a little bit. Nothing else we can
do here yet.

Head out, and up to Evergreen Island north of Route 11.

Evergreen Island

| Binacle           | 5        |                 |          |

Talk to the Octillery here to battle them.

Attempt to enter the forest, and Nana will stop you. She’ll invite you
to her home, so head in. She’ll give you the *Mysterious Emblem.* This
will also give you access to a PC and bed, which we’ll be using a lot in
this section.

Grab something from the PC with Blizzard, and something with either
Magnitude, Earthquake, or Bulldoze. The best choice is training a
Castform to 35 for Blizzard, and any Pokémon who’ll learn the Bulldoze
T.M. Also, grab something with Heat Wave, Flame Burst, Lava Plume, or
Eruption. Salandit from the safari zone also has one of these.

Then, surf to the cave in the middle here and use Blizzard in a battle.
After the field has changed, use the ground move, and a path will open.
Enter and surf to battle **Lapras!**

Heal at Nana’s house again, then pick up a hidden *Heart Scale* and
enter the cave to the right.

Use the fire move in battle, then surf across. Exit the southeast ladder
to get:

ZCell 029: Evergreen Island

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image29.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.03125in" />

Enter again and take the ladder down. We can’t yet do the strength
puzzle portion, but we can explore. Beat the trainers then grab the *X
Special.* Hidden is a *Zinc, Rare Candy,* and *Full Heal.* Hop into the
hole all the way at the bottom. Grab the *DeepSeaScale* then head
through the hole. We can’t do anything in this area yet, but we will
come back. Head back up the ladder twice. Jump down the leftmost hole to
get *DeepSeaTooth.* In this path you’ll find the Icy Rock. That’s all we
can do for now without strength, so head back out of the cave.

Finally, enter the forest.

There are also Swablu that fly around here. There is a stationary
Stantler to the right in the forest, as well as **Buneary**. Catch two
for a trade!

There are lots of *Snowballs* on the ground we can pick up. Hidden
around the entrance areas are a *Max Repel,* and *Genius Wing.* Head up
and to the right for a *Dusk Ball* on the mountain.

Head back to the middle area. Hidden as you head up and to the dead end
on the left is *Ice Heal, Ice Gem*, *Paralyze Heal, Hyper Potion, Zinc,*
and *Genius Wing.* Surf across the pond we passed earlier. Hidden on
this path is *Resist Wing, HP Up, Rare Candy,* and *Magical Seed.* At
night we can battle stationary Snorunt.

Head back down and surf back across the pond. Go up and right to find a
hidden *X Special.* Finally go all the way up to the spring and grab the
*Max Repel.* Whether you got Anju’s Pendant or not, the Mysterious
Emblem will allow you to enter the spring of preservation at the top.

Enter the spring and talk to the **Piplup** for a battle.

One more thing we can do in this area for now: evolve one of your
Buneary via happiness into **Lopunny,** then trade it with the person on
Evergreen Island for a **Shroomish.**

That’s all we can do in the Route 11 area.

Take the boat to Terajuma, then surf up in this spot to return to where
we got Valarie’s badge, and get Poliwag \#4. Head up to Valor Shore and
surf up for Poliwag \#5.

Head up and talk to Dragonite! He’s lost all his letters again. The
first is on the island immediately to the right. The second is on an
island around a loop dead south of Dragonite. The third is dead east of
the second. Finally, the fourth is on Route 5 in the grass on the left.
Talk to Dragonite again to get a *Shiny Stone.*

Return to the Terajuma Jungle, and find the girl who wants the berries.
Give them to her and you’ll be able to buy some mulch.

Terajuma Jungle Mulch Shop

*Growth Mulch* $200

*Stable Mulch* $200

That’s all we can do for this massive load of quests, so head back to
Crawli’s gym.

## Infested Badge - Badge06

Enter Crawli’s gym in the ranger HQ once you have prepped your team.
Talk to Holly at the entrance, then enter one of the caves and talk to
her again - and our challenge will begin.

    the right you can find:

ZCell 030: Kakori Gym

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image30.png"
style="width:6.66667in;height:4.98958in" />

-   Head back all the way down, and to the right. Climb the stairs by
    the teleporter

-   Push the log off the platform down, then use it to cross to the
    middle platform. Approach the tile that sticks out, and if you’ve
    found all the Ariados, an event will play.

-   Jump across and enter.

-   Talk to Holly, then get onto the bridge. Go to the right and surf
    down to grab *Bug Memory.* Back on the bridge, take the leap of
    faith!

Down in the bottom floor, you’ll find a small tutor.

<u>Kakori Gym Move Tutor</u>

Giga Drain 3 Green Shards

Talk to Aelita at the top, then head in. Flying around in here are wild
**Yanma,** which you can catch. It can be useful for this fight if you
want to go train it up due to its strong AncientPower and Air Slash.
Anyways, pass Crawli and head into the cave at the top. Head left and
then follow this path down to get:

ZCell 031: Kakori Depths

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image31.png"
style="width:6.63542in;height:4.98958in" />

Anyways, if you head outside the gym, there’s an Audino breeder by the
Pokémon Center. You’ll get 5 *Exp. Candy M* each time you win. Once
you’re ready, return to Crawli’s chamber and stand across him!

Gym Leader Crawli (Forest Field, Raining)

-   Ariados, Level 43. @ Telluric Seed.

    -   Barbed Web

    -   Stomping Tantrum

    -   Poison Jab

    -   Shadow Sneak

-   Galvantula, Level 44. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Bug Buzz

    -   Sticky Web

    -   Thunder

    -   Rain Dance

-   Escavalier, Level 43. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Slash

    -   Iron Head

    -   Drill Run

    -   Barbed Web

-   Golisopod, Level 43. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   First Impression

    -   Aqua Jet

    -   Leech Life

    -   Liquidation

-   Pinsir, Level 44. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Storm Throw

    -   Throat Chop

    -   Barbed Web

    -   Rock Slide

-   Araquanid, Level 45. @ Mystic Water.

    -   Liquidation

    -   Sticky Web

    -   Barbed Web

    -   Poison Jab

Barbed Web: Bug \| Physical \| 75 power \| 100% accuracy \| Hits both
foes in a Double Battle \| Increased critical hit ratio. If the target's
side of the field already has Sticky Web, sets a layer of Spikes.

Ho boy, this is a tough battle if you’re not prepared. Crawli’s team
plays in doubles and basically has everything stacked for it - a field
that boosts almost all his Bug moves and gives Slash a grass typing,
rain that nullifies fire types entirely, and a well-structured team
built around speed control. Ariados will be +1 attack and immune to
damage for its first turn, but you can do the same with a Telluric Seed.
After Galvantula dies, he doesn’t really have anything that is
inherently speedy - so if you can find a way to get rid of or ignore the
sticky web, you’ll be able to wear him down. Rock Slide is great here -
everything bar Escavalier will go down to it handily.

You can also take advantage of the rain! Swift Swim will help you negate
the speed loss from the Sticky Web, plus rain boosted water moves.
Alternatively you can duke it out on Rainbow Field by changing the
weather to sunny.

Once you’ve triumphed, claim the Infested Badge for Pokemon up to level
50.

Head outside and talk to Melia and Valarie.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - I sure did. (Melia +2)  
            - It was a tough battle... (Neutral)  
            - I lost. (Melia +4)

That’s it for this part!

## Complete the V13 Dex - V13Dex1

While you wait for the next episode, if you’d like, you can fill your
dex as much as possible. Note that I assume everything in bold above has
been obtained already. I will only be listing everything here that you
must evolve/breed in V13 that we haven’t already done so for a quest.

The best place to post up for battles is the Route 9 grinder. Lead with
a Ghost/Fighting type and go nuts, you’ll get Exp. Candy for winning.
Friendship berries are available at Maman’s Camp. As for item evolutions, 
they’re all available in the Shopping District.
