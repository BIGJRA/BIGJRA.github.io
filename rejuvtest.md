# Walkthrough Version 13.2.0

# Written by @BIGJRA

Welcome to my walkthrough of Pokemon Rejuvenation!

While you’re here, try checking out 
[my Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBx7xQxOKBsEP4k28h-KgQ)! 
I post various fan-game things from time to time. 

Do you have concerns/suggestions/etc? Message me on Discord with 
BIGJRA#3883 or use the forum thread for discussion. If you want to 
contribute pull requests to the site yourself: message me on Discord.

Use CTRL + F to find a specific section. I also oriented this guide as
such that CTRL + F will work for T.M. Names, certain items, Zygarde
cells, tutors, Pokémon Locations, and more!



# Appendices

## Complete the V13 Dex - V13Dex1

While you wait for the next episode, if you’d like, you can fill your
dex as much as possible. Note that I assume everything in bold above has
been obtained already. I will only be listing everything here that you
must evolve/breed in V13 that we haven’t already done so for a quest.

The best place to post up for battles is the Route 9 grinder. Lead with
a Ghost/Fighting type and go nuts, you’ll get Exp. Candy for winning.
Friendship berries are available at Maman’s Camp. As for item evolutions, 
they’re all available in the Shopping District.
