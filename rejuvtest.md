# Chapter 1: Shipwrecked

## Prologue - Prolog

To start, the “M” key toggles a speed-up of the game. The game will
start off asking if you want to skip the prologue. Rejuvenation is a
very story-focused game, so I recommend viewing it if it is your first
time playing. If you do skip the prologue, jump ahead to the next
section.

As soon as you’re done reading the Zorua and Pangoro story, take control
of Maria and head downstairs to talk to Mom. Afterwards enter the bottom
room on the left side of the first floor and head downstairs and
interact with the summoning table.

Head back upstairs and talk to Dad in the top-left room. Then return to
the kitchen to talk to Mom. After that go upstairs. After a brief flash
and the sound of breaking glass, go back downstairs and talk with the
mysterious figure. Head west back down to the basement to watch the
cutscene.

After regaining control of Marianette, head down, east, and up through
the hallway and watch the final cutscene of the prologue play out.

## S.S. Oceana - Oceana1

After either skipping the prologue or finishing the last cutscene, the
game asks which difficulty mode you’d prefer. Personally, I would
recommend Casual Mode for anyone attempting to do a more restrictive
challenge run or anyone who does not have much experience with the
Reborn-style Pokémon game. I would recommend Normal Mode to anyone
looking for a challenge or who found Reborn’s difficulty adequate, and
Intense Mode to those with lots of experience who found Normal / Reborn
too easy, somehow. Regardless of choice, the game allows you to change
your difficulty setting later if you want. **I will be covering battles
in this guide as they appear in Normal Mode.**

Register yourself as a trainer, choosing among genders and six sprites.
Amanda will ask if you want to input a password. I don’t recommend using
the password if you’ve never played the game, since this section
contains many important story beats, but if you do want to skip ahead to
the next section, the password is 4567, though you’ll lose out on
potential relationship points with Nancy.

There are two other passwords you can input here. If you want to play as
a legacy protagonist sprite, type 1111. If you want to play the game as
a certain side quest character from later (Ana), type 9494.

Exit the first room and talk to Nancy. This is the first of instances
that get you relationship points with characters - which affect how they
view you. Thanks to Punch for collecting the information about these.
Any dialogue options which are not listed do not affect relationship
points. (Search “Relationship Point” to see them all)

Relationship Point Choices:
- I’m fine. (Mom +2)
- ... (Mom -1)

Once you’ve talked to Nancy and can roam, explore the S.S. Oceana. In
this game talking to everyone and everything you see can be vital to
discovering new Pokémon and Items, so it's a good idea to talk to
everyone aboard.

Heading to the stairs on the left, in the two rooms you can enter on the
left side, there are two notches in the wall. Interacting with them, you
can listen in on two conversations: one with unknown figures and the
other including Nancy.

Head up the stairs three times to the right to talk to Cpt. Augustus.
He’ll explain a few of Rejuvenation’s mechanics. Head downstairs and
enter the double doors to the upper middle room. Talk to Nancy to get
the banquet started, when you’re ready.

Once you regain control, follow the path and watch the events play out.

## Oceana Pier - OPier1

After either skipping the boat scenes or watching the cutscenes, talk to
Tesla. Once you regain control, you can explore Oceana Pier.

Now is a good time to change some of your options. I recommend doing
Text Speed: Max and Battle Scene: Off if you want the game to go
quickly. For a bit more challenge, you can also change the battle mode
to “Set.” I also recommend storing at least a few backups -- save files
can get corrupted.

Anyways, if you want to talk to the woman on the northeast pier, you can
get an all-expenses paid trip to Hoenn, but it is a game over.
Otherwise, there’s not too much to do here yet, so head into the gate on
the north side.

## Gearen Laboratory - GearLab1

The trainers won’t let you head west or east quite yet, so head into the
building north.

The guy running in place on the left will offer to give you cinematic
bars during important cutscenes if you want. Talk to the girl behind the
counter to buy some basic products:

<u>Gearen Lab Shop</u>:

|Item|Price|
|---|---|
|*Poke Ball*|$200|
|*Potion*|$300|
|*Repel*|$350|
|*Antidote*|$100|

You start with $1,500. I recommend picking up at least a few Poke balls
to catch some team members soon, as a full team is almost necessary to
succeed in Rejuvenation, even as early as the first gym battle of this
game.

Talk to Amanda at the top of the building to see a brief cutscene, then
head up towards the door to meet Melia. Go through the door to meet
Professor Jenner. You’ll then get to pick a starter Pokémon by
interacting with it. If you talk to the rainbow-colored machine on the
right side, it will randomly choose for you among the 24 starters.

<u>Starter Choices (Pick ONE)</u>:

- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**
- **Grookey**
- **Scorbunny**
- **Sobble**

As in Reborn, Speed Boost Torchic is arguably the strongest choice --
but all the starters can be useful in their own ways. The first gym
specializes in Poison, so the Grass-type starters may be difficult to
use at first. Choose whatever you want though!

You can quick save with ‘D’ in front of the Pokémon you choose and use
‘F12’ to soft reset for natures, IV’s, shininess, and abilities. All
Pokémon in this game have a chance at hidden abilities and the shiny
rate is increased to a little over 1/100.

Anyways, once you’ve picked your starter, head west for a battle with
Aevium Scout Amanda! You can win or lose this battle.

<u>League Scout Amanda (No Field)</u>

-   Hatenna, Level 5.
    -   Tackle
    -   Play Nice

Note that in this game you can press “S” to check the stats of all the
Pokemon, as well as the weather / field / move effects in play to aid
you in your fights. After the battle, she’ll give you *5 Poke Balls.*
Head to talk to Jenner and you’ll fight:

<u>Pokemon Trainer Ren (No Field)</u>

-   Froakie, Level 5.
    -   Pound
    -   Growl

After the fight with Ren, Jenner asks you to visit Route 1 to help
Melia. He then gives you the *Pokedex* and the *Cybernav!* Head back
downstairs and listen to Jan’s tutorial.

The EV training center can be accessed by talking to the woman on the
right of the counter, but none of its training rooms are open right now.

When you’re ready, head back outside to start exploring East Gearen
City!

## Left East Gearen City - EGear1

This guide will not cover every NPC trainer, but know that as you
explore Aevium there are many!

Patches of grass around Gearen City have opened, so consider catching
some Pokémon to assist your starter.

<u>Left East Gearen City</u>

| Grass: Morning        | %        |Grass: Day         | %        | Grass: Night    | %        |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|----------------------|----------|
| **Rattata (Alolan)**  | 30       | **Bidoof**        | 30       | **Rattata (Alolan)** | 30       |
| **Wurmple**           | 25       | **Wurmple**       | 25       | **Wurmple**          | 25       |
| **Pidgey**            | 15       | **Pidove**        | 15       | **Poochyena**        | 15       |
| **Patrat**            | 15       | **Patrat**        | 15       | **Hoothoot**         | 15       |
| **Bellsprout**        | 10       | **Bellsprout**    | 10       | **Oddish**           | 10       |
| **Sunkern**           | 5        | **Sunkern**       | 5        | **Chingling**        | 5        |

Chingling can help in the fight against the gym dramatically, especially
if you manage to evolve it. However, it is rare-ish here and can be
found much more reliably later.

If you go west on the bottom street, you can find a GourmetTreat in a
bush. We’ll want some of these later to get event Pokémon.

If you talk to the nerd on the east side of the bottom street, he’ll
give you *Reverse Candy.* The tile to the left of the rightmost tree on
this street has a hidden *Oran Berry* in it. Another *Oran Berry* can be
found immediately below the machine thing on the right street, above
Lacey.

If you go up to the north, left, and down, you can find an *Elemental
Seed* one tile above the left of two trees. There is also a *Resist
Wing* in the grass four spaces to the right.

Heading up to the park, you can find a *Grass Gem* one tile left of the
rightmost bench in the park. Sneaking around the wall to the right,
there is a *Blue Shard* in the side of the building, and on the other
side, an *Escape Rope* in the wall. The tile one down and one right from
the bottom right edge of the fountain has another *Grass Gem*, and
straight to the left the third tile from the edge of the park holds a
*Super Repel.*

You can find a *GourmetTreat* in the wall between two dumpsters on the
north side of the city up one set of stairs, and *Yellow Shard* on the
ground between the two dumpsters to the left of those. Another *Yellow
Shard* is in the rightmost dumpster up another set of stairs.

Head out to the Oceana Pier. You’ll find a **Nidoran M** eating. Talk to
it with a GourmetTreat for a battle.

The garden to the south is also now open, so you can catch level 5
**Fletchling** here by interacting with them. If you’re interested in
winning even the “impossible” story battles, make sure you catch two,
for their Quick Guard move will help us win one later. The bottom right
grass tile here has a *Sweet Heart,* and there is an *X Accuracy* two
tiles left and one up from there.

Head into the building on the west side that’s now unlocked. Talk to the
“man” with the yellow hair, then exit the building and watch Buizel run
by. This starts a quest we’ll complete later.

Back in East Gearen, to the left of the lab is the Velvet Building. In
each of the buildings, people will challenge you to battles, so be
warned. Head up to the first floor and talk to the woman in the middle.
If you choose left, she’ll give you a *Mineral Ball,* and *Steam Ball*
if you choose right. Also grab the *Great Ball* in the bottom left. If
you enter the second floor, you’ll see a **Pachirisu** running wild. If
you give it a GourmetTreat, it’ll battle you. There is also a *Potion*
in the corner. Grab the *Exp. Candy XS* on the third floor.

Now go to the Emerald Building on the northeast side of town. Talk to a
girl on the left side to learn about the mystery of the third floor.
You’ll need to beat a trainer to access the upper levels. On the second
floor pick up a *Red Shard* in the corner. Talk to a red-haired girl for
a *Full Heal*, and get a *Super Repel* from an old woman. Enter the
third floor to battle a level 5 **Shuppet**.

If you enter the Magnolia Library on the north side of town and pay $300
you can enter the back side of the library. By talking to the man in
glasses you can use the shards hidden around the map for tutor moves.
These aren’t very useful, but you can get them for your Pokémon if you
want to.

<u>Library Move Tutor</u>

|Move|Price|
|---|---|
|Bind |1 Red Shard|
|Covet |1 Blue Shard|
|Helping Hand |1 Yellow Shard|

The building on the left of the library is the Gearen Help Center. We’ll
be returning here later.

After doing all this you may be strong enough to complete the final
quest of this area for now. If you try to cross into the northwest side
of the city, a thug will force you to pay $300 or to battle him. He uses
two Level 12-13 Pokémon, so be sure you’re ready. When you win you can
access the northwest area! (+1 Karma, a way for the game to track how
much you help people)

Two tiles up and two tiles right of the grandma on the bench is a hidden
*Red Shard.* Three down and three left of the cop in the top left is a
*Super Potion.*

You can interact with a Nidoran in this map. Follow it to these
locations:

1. First encounter -- northeast by Emerald building.

2. Northwest by train station.

3. East side of the city near bridge, next to dumpster

4. North side, south of library near some dumpsters

After this encounter you can interact with it and battle it. **Nidoran
F** is at level 5.

## Right East Gearen City - EGear2

You’ll see grass around this part of the city too, with more Pokémon.

<u>Right East Gearen City</u>

| Grass: Morning        | %        | Grass: Day        | %        | Grass: Night        | %        |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|----------|
| Rattata (Alolan)      | 30       | Bidoof            | 30       | Rattata (Alolan)    | 30       |
| **Paras**             | 28       | **Paras**         | 28       | **Jigglypuff**      | 28       |
| Patrat                | 25       | Patrat            | 25       | Poochyena           | 25       |
| Pidgey                | 15       | Pidove            | 15       | Hoothoot            | 15       |
| **Klink**             | 2        | **Klink**         | 2        | **Klink**           | 2        |

Catch a Female Jigglypuff to breed later.

Heading straight up from the entrance, to the left of the machine in the
grass is a hidden *Super Repel,* and the bottom right tile in this
grassy area contains a *Poke Ball.* The bush to the right has a hidden
*Resist Wing.*

To the east, you’ll see a *Super Potion* near a tent. Here you’ll meet
Mr. Luck -- this is how you change your difficulty, as I mentioned
earlier.

Down and to the left is a machine, one tile up there is a hidden
*Potion.*

The center of the map has a row of shops. I usually sell the Resist
Wings here to get some cash. Here’s where you get more GourmetTreats if
you run out. We aren’t going to need any Reverse Candies in this game
beyond the ones we find since the level cap is a hard cap unless you use
Rare Candies to go over it.

<u>East Gearen Market Shop: Top Left Vendor</u>

|Item           |Price      |   
| ---           | ---       |
|*Poke Ball*    |$200       |
|*Potion*       |$300       |
|*GourmetTreat* |$1500      |
|*Repel*        |$350       |
|*Reverse Candy*|$50        |

<u>East Gearen Market Shop: Bottom Left Vendor</u>

|Item           |Price      |   
| ---           | ---       |
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Ice Heal*     |$250       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Awakening*    |$250       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |

<u>East Gearen Market Shop: Bottom-right Vendor (Only available Weekdays,
during the daytime)</u>

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Reverse Candy*|$50        |
|*Soda Pop*     |$300       |

If you talk to the vendor on the top right, he’ll attempt to sell you
Poke Ball’s at $400 each. While this may seem like a rip-off, once you
buy four, he’ll give you a **Voltorb!**

If you enter the Shopping Emporium above the market vendors, there are a
few shops open for business.

<u>Berry Emporium Shop</u>

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Oran Berry*---|$200       |
|*Pecha Berry*  |$300       |

You can pick up a few of each berry for the gym.

<u>Poke Ball Emporium Shop</u>

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Heavy Ball*   |$300       |
|*Moon Ball*    |$300       |

The Heavy Ball won’t be too useful for the beginning portion of the
game. If you haven’t captured Jigglypuff or done the Nidoran events,
Moon Balls can be extra useful, but the cheaper, normal balls also 
work fine. The right vendor is currently not in business due to an 
unfulfilled help quest, which we’ll get to later.

Heading down a street, three tiles east and one down from the bicycle
shop door you’ll find a *Pretty Wing.* In a park to the right, two tiles
left of a skinny tree is a hidden *Repel.* Heading east from here, in
the upper right patch in the grass under some train tracks you’ll find
an *Antidote,* and five tiles to the east of the corner of blue liquid
below you, in the street, is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

On the southeast point of the city, if you go west past Karrina, you can
find a *Reverse Candy* hiding in the shade of the tree.

Along the east side of the city, you should see Buizel. His trainer will
show up. Win the battle, and **Buizel** is yours!

North from here, grab an *Iron.* Again, I recommend selling it as $4900
is a lot of money at this point in the game. Down and left from here,
from the bottom end of the blue liquid, five tiles left is a hidden
*Revive.*

Go up towards the Chrisola Resort in the northeast corner of town. Head
east as you get up the stairs and follow the path to get *TM83:
Infestation.* The two flower pots on either side of the door have hidden
*Paralyze Heal* and *Green Shard.*

## Chrisola Resort - CResor1

Enter the Chrisola Hotel Resort at the top of the map. Entering gives us
a Relationship Point (Saki +1).

After you regain control, talk to a man in the bottom right for a *Super
Potion.* Enter the right hallway and go past the first two rooms and
into the first on the upper side to get *TM126 Whirlpool.* In the
hallway on the left, head into the open room at the top and interact
with the tile down and right from the top left plant for $1,500!

Head to the Casino level and talk to the red-haired fellow. They’ll
flush their Coin Case down the drain so we can pick it up later.

You’ve probably noticed a few popups regarding achievements thus far --
complete them and you’ll earn AP, redeemable here. For now, we probably
can’t get much but I recommend saving up for the HM Items as they’ll
make your life a lot easier. The card items will allow you access to EV
Training rooms in Jenner’s lab, so those are nice too. The Exp. All
isn’t that necessary anymore in this game since there are lots of
grinding options available. Anyways, talk to the girl on the right side
to get an *Achievement Card.*

<u>AP Shop</u>

*Adamant Mint* 3 AP

*Jolly Mint* 3 AP

*Brave Mint* 3 AP

*Timid Mint* 3 AP

*Modest Mint* 3 AP

*Quiet Mint* 3 AP

*Calm Mint* 3 AP

*Bold Mint* 3 AP

*PP Up* 6 AP

*Golden Axe* 10 AP

*Golden Hammer* 10 AP

*Golden Surfboard* 15 AP

*Golden Gauntlet* 15 AP

*Golden Scuba Gear* 15 AP

*Golden Wings* 20 AP

*Golden Jetpack* 20 AP

*Golden Drift Board* 20 AP

*Golden Claws* 20 AP

*Exp. All* 30 AP

*HP Card* 10 AP

*Atk Card* 10 AP

*Def Card* 10 AP

*Speed Card* 10 AP

*Sp. Atk Card* 10 AP

*Sp. Def Card* 10 AP

I wouldn’t recommend buying any of the first nine items until you get
everything else. Golden Items allow us to use HM’s without needing a
Pokémon in the party that has learned them. The Cards allow us to access
EV training rooms. Exp. All is very helpful for grinding, but with the
grinders and Exp. Candies, it may not be the most useful thing for its
high price yet. The cards let you into the basement of the Gearen lab to
do rapid EV training. When you do get access to each EV room, inside
you’ll find the respective Power item: *Power Anklet, Power Band, Power
Belt, Power Bracer, Power Lens, Power Weight.*

When I play, I tend to buy the Golden Hammer first, then begin
collecting the Cards. I’ll buy the Golden Axe as soon as I get Cut, then
finish with AP cards. Then I’ll buy the rest of the Golden Items as I
need them, and the Exp. All when I have enough AP.

Head up to the top floor of the building, Rooftop. There is an Audino
breeder up here: every time you beat them, you will get 3 *Exp. Candy
S.* Combined with the hard level cap, these breeders make level
management in this game a breeze!

Three tiles down and two to the right from the lamppost two to the left
of the breeder is a hidden *Oran Berry.* Two lampposts down from the
breeder, there is a hidden *Resist Wing* four tiles right and one up.
Finally, from the right set of stairs to the helipad two tiles down and
one right has a hidden *Reverse Candy.*

There are Pokémon to encounter here.

Chrisola Rooftop

| Bellsprout                | 2        | Oddish              | 2        |

Once you’re done, head back outside. Enter the Aqua Building to the
southwest. On the first floor, pick up the *Old Rod*, as well as another
*Iron*! If you attempt to go to the third floor, you’ll enter a really
impossible battle (Level 80!) given the tools we have now. I don’t
recommend this unless you have the money and self-respect to spare.

## Gearen Park - GPark1

Head to the bottom part of this area.

You can find a *Heart Scale* in the wall between two trees on the left.
Two tiles right of the rightmost purple flower is a *TinyMushroom.*
Enter Gearen Park below.

Gearen Park (Grassy Terrain)

|                       |          |                   |          |                     |          |

The first tile below the really tall grass in the second column on the
left of really tall grass has a hidden *Honey.* Straight down, another
*Honey* is three tiles up from the bottom flower. In the left tile of
the tree straight left from the bench here, you’ll find a *Carbos.* On
the right side of the park, there is a hidden *Rare Candy* in the second
empty spot among really tall grass from the bottom. Up from here in
between a square of 7 tall grass and a purple flower is a *Blue Shard*,
and 4 tiles up and 2 left is a *Muscle Wing.* Finally in the concrete on
the bottom, in the center two tiles up from the bottom, is a *Yellow
Shard.*

## Sewers Visit 1 - Sewer1

To progress the story, head east into Venam’s front yard, down from here
a bit, and see a cutscene. Head to the Emporium to get a *Pecha Berry?*
from the attendant. Give it to Venam.

Choices:

- All me. (Venam +2)

- Maybe… (Venam +1)

- No, actually. (Neutral)

Head to the southeast of town and a cutscene will play. Afterwards
follow Venam into the sewers. You’ll be teaming up with Ren here, who
will heal your Pokémon after every battle. Additionally, if you try to
catch Pokémon while with Ren, you’ll need to knock one of the two out in
order to catch the other, which can be frustrating.

Anyways, there are lots of new Pokémon here:

Abandoned Sewers

| <u>Cave:</u>     | <u>%</u> | <u>Old Rod</u> | <u>%</u> |

| **Geodude**      | 1        |                |          |

Head left, and on the second tile from left at the bottom is a hidden
*Poison Gem.* Head across the bridge and right to get a *Great Ball.* Go
up and before crossing the bridge, there is a hidden *Zinc* in the
bottom right corner. Talk to a bug catcher to get a *Pecha Berry.* To
the right is a *Bold Mint.* Above the girl to the left is a hidden
*Potion* and in the thing to the right is another *Potion.*

Heading back down and crossing to the left, if the guy flushed it at the
Hotel, go left and all the way down to grab the *Coin Case!* The corner
to the right and down has a hidden *Reverse Candy.*

Attempt to enter the room Venam runs into and it will lock you out.
There’s an *Antidote* to the left.

Head back across the bridge, up and left to the generator room. Start
the third, first, then second generator. Go back into the room Venam
went into for a long cutscene and a battle.

<u>Garbodor Garbage Crew (No field)</u>

-   Trubbish, Level 11.

    -   Pound

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Recycle

    -   Tackle

-   Trubbish, Level 12.

    -   Pound

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Recycle

    -   Tackle

-   Garbodor, Level 13.

    -   Pound

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Toxic Spikes

Knocking out the Trubbish makes this a two-on-one. Any of your new
Poison-types should be able to resist getting poisoned here, but really
any strong STAB moves can take out the Trubbish. Ren’s Growlithe hits
hard with Ember, plus he has two more in the back, so you shouldn’t
really have to worry here.

## Game Corner Prizes - GCorner1

Now’s a good time to mention all the prizes available in the game
corner. While you can get them all right now with enough patience, it’s
not necessary to grab everything right now.

Anyways, there’s a grand total of 120 coins along the ground in there,
try to find them all. Otherwise, here’s what you can get here:

<u>Coin Vendor</u>

50 Coins $1,000

500 Coins $10,000

<u>Left Vendor</u>

*TM70 Flash* 1000 Coins

*TM10 Hidden Power* 5000 Coins

<u>Right Vendor</u>

**Seel** 1000 Coins

**Spoink** 4000 Coins

**Maractus** 5000 Coins

**Helioptile** 6500 Coins

To get coins you can buy them or play the various games in the casino.
Of these, Voltorb Flip is easily the most efficient once you know what
you’re doing... but with the luck involved it will take quite a while
still. I recommend getting Spoink for the gym and Hidden Power in order
to spice up your early game movesets, but it’s up to you.

The attendant on the left is the lotto corner lady, who’ll pick one
number a day and check if it matches your Pokémon’s, like in the
official games. The prizes are as follows:

<u>Lotto Attendant</u>

*Master Ball* 5 Matches

*Max Revive* 4 Matches

*Exp. Share* 3 Matches

*PP Up* 2 Matches

*Ultra Ball* 1 Matches

Anyways, once you’ve gambled to your heart’s content, there is a bit
more optional stuff to do if you want.

In Gearen Park, talk to Melia for an optional scene for Relationship
Points (Melia +3).

Relationship Point Choices:

- You like photography? (Melia +1)

- What are you doing? (Neutral)

Relationship Point Choices:

- I love photography! (Melia +2)

- I appreciate the art! (Melia +1)

- It's not for me. (Neutral)

- Photography's boring. (Melia -2)

Additionally, head back to Magnolia Library, and for a short time you’ll
be able to battle Ren -- it’s optional experience and money should you
want it.

## PoisonHeart Badge - Badge01 

It’s time to take on Venam’s gym in East Gearen. This gym will require
us to mix colors to make composite colors.

Take out the first trainer and learn the color combination we need to
build is Magenta. To mix magenta, add red and blue.

In the second room, we’re going to make orange and green. Do red and
yellow first, then check the machine. Then do teal and yellow to make
green and move into the third room.

The trainer in the next room will tell you to make Orange, White, and
Teal.

The first is red + yellow, and the second is green + red + blue.
Finally, add just green + blue and we’re in.

Well, that would be all we have to do, but there’s a secret. If you mix
brown, then white, then orange, you’ll get access to a secret area. A
fun fact: the Seviper and Venipede boarded up gyms are versions of
Venam’s gym from older versions of Rejuvenation!

After emerging, two tiles to the left of the top dumpster is a hidden
*Psychic Gem.* Up the stairs all the way left is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

In the upper left corner here, you can find a hidden *Rare Candy!* One
tile down and 4 right is a hidden *Red Shard.* Here too is a **Seviper**
Egg as well as a *Fresh Water* hidden 4 tiles right of it.

Gearen Alleyway

|              |          |
|--------------|----------|
| <u>Grass</u> | <u>%</u> |
| **Sentret**  | 30       |
| Poochyena    | 20       |

| Pidgey       | 5        |
| Patrat       | 4        |

Well, that’s about it for that area, so clear your team, equip all the
good items you can take advantage of (Oran and Pecha Berries work well
here), and save.

<u>Punk Girl Venam (Corrosive Field)</u>

Venam's Kiss: Poison \| Physical \| 75 power \| 100% accuracy \| 10%
chance to poison, super-effective against Steel-types.

Honestly, this one isn’t too bad. If you’ve picked up Chingling or
Spoink, they can wreck the house here. Marshtomp, my starter, helped as
well, though Mud Shot gains Poison typing on the field. Ultimately this
is not too bad and if you’re really struggling with an under leveled
team you can push them to the Lv. 18 cap and win by sheer stat
advantage.

After the battle, you’ll be rewarded with the *PoisonHeart Badge*!
She’ll also give you *TM102 Poison Sweep!* This is a new move that can
be useful in the early game.

## Post-Gym Quests - EGear3

Some quests have opened, everything in this section is optional though.

Return to Gearen Lab. The girl by the PC will gift you an **Aevian
Feebas** from Jan! How nice of him.

Head to the Magnolia Library. Talk to the guard of the stairs to the
right. As you have a badge, she’ll let you pass.

Upstairs, you’ll find a Black Belt who will offer to teach more tutor
moves for shards.

<u>Library 2F Move Tutor</u>

Dual Chop 2 Yellow Shards

Block 2 Blue Shards

Super Fang 2 Red Shards

Of these, Super Fang can be useful for catching Pokémon, and Dual Chop
can give you coverage against Dragon types if you really need it.

Talk to the girl on the right. This is Zumi, and she’ll start us on a
Pokedex collection quest. We’ll be back once we catch a Dedenne for her.

Head into Venam’s house south of the hotel. If you head upstairs, you’ll
find a *Poison Barb.*

Back in Gearen Park, now you’ll be able to give a treat to
**Gossifleur** for a battle!

Head back to Gearen Lab and talk to the girl sitting by the computer on
the left. Now that we have a badge, she’ll ask for some help with an
online fangame league. She’ll then give you a *Badge Card.* Talk to her
again and agree to help.

Your first battle is against Falkner.

<u>Gym Leader Falkner (Glitch Field)</u>

-   Hoothoot, Level 11.

    -   Confusion

    -   Peck

    -   Hypnosis

-   Noctowl, Level 12.

    -   Confusion

    -   Peck

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Echoed Voice

I am using Cyndaquil and Onix. Use Ember and Rock Tomb and you should
come out on top. If you win, you’ll get a *Virtual Badge.* That’s all
she needs for now, we’ll come back after we have two badges.

One shop has updated inventory now that we have a badge. Head to the
Shopping Emporium.

<u>Poke Ball Emporium New Items (1 Badge)</u>

*Love Ball* $300

*Fast Ball* $300

Love Balls are a very useful ball for their price, just pay attention to
the gender of what you’re trying to catch.

Now’s a good time to start taking on the Help Center quests, so head
into the help center. You’ll be approached by Ayuda, who’ll give you a
quest to collect Zygarde cells. He’ll give you the *Gather Cube* to
begin this quest. We will finish the help quests first, then get the
cells.

<u>HQuest 1: Help Starly</u>

-   Start at Gearen Lab. Talk to the black-haired girl next to Nurse Joy

## Route 1 and Goldenwood Forest - Rt1GF1

Once you’re ready to leave, head to the northwest part of town and enter
the train station. Inside the station, you’ll meet up with Tesla, who’ll
buy you a ticket and give you *Potions.* Talk to the grandfather in the
station and agree to help him, then board the train. Battles at Route 1
are on the Golden Forest field.

Route 1 (Forest Field)

The tree to the left of the second red flower from the train has a
hidden *Potion.* Grab the *Super Repel* and the *Jolly Mint* above.

You’ll see a **Whismur** nearby. If you give it a GourmetTreat, it’ll
battle you!

ZCell 005: Route 1

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image5.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.02083in" />

Head north and enjoy a great cutscene montage with Melia. Once you
regain control, interact with Drifblim.

Relationship Point Choices:

- It was no bother! (Narcissa +1)

- It was a complete bother. (Narcissa -1)

You’ll get an *HP Up.* Another free $4900! Grab the nearby *Potion* as
well and talk to the Furfrou lady for another *Potion.*

Goldenwood Forest (Forest Field)

| Furret       | 1        |                |          |

There are some trainers south to battle. When you’re ready, head north
into Goldenwood Cave.

Melia will join your party here.

Goldenwood Cave (Cave Field)

|             |          |
|-------------|----------|
| <u>Cave</u> | <u>%</u> |
| Geodude     | 49       |
| Noibat      | 34       |
| **Woobat**  | 15       |
| Furret      | 2        |

Woobat is good for the next gym.

To the right, one of the rocks contains a hidden *Red Shard.* The tile
right of a skinny tree above the steps has a *TinyMushroom,* and the top
left rock as you head down the left stairs has a *Blue Shard.* The top
left rock in the area past the bridge hides a *Potion,* and if you head
up to the top area on the right, one tile down and three right of the
skinny tree is a *TinyMushroom,* while another *TinyMushroom* is a tile
left of the top of two red flowers on the right. Heading back to the
top, the rock below Leavanny has a *Great Ball.* If you can, do the
optional battle against Mars here.

<u>Culvier Clan Mars</u>

-   Sewaddle, Level 15. @ Light Clay.

    -   Return

    -   Bug Bite

    -   Seed Bomb

    -   Light Screen

-   Swadloon, Level 18. @ Miracle Seed.

    -   Return

    -   Iron Defense

    -   Seed Bomb

    -   Double Team

-   Leavanny, Level 20. @ Leftovers.

    -   Return

    -   Seed Bomb

    -   Synthesis

    -   Iron Defense

Fire and Flying moves obviously work great here if you can stall out the
Light Screen and/or avoid Iron Defense bulk. If you do manage to
succeed, you’ll get a *Star Shard* and a **Sewaddle**!

If you follow Melia, you’ll appear in a small room. Interact with the
rock at the top for a *PP Up!* I don’t recommend using this on your weak
moves just yet, either save it or sell it for $4900.

Make sure you’ve caught everything you care to in the whole Goldenwood
Forest/Cave area, as we won’t be able to come back for a little while.

Anyways, heal your team and talk to Melia.

Relationship Point Choices:

- I will cherish it too! (Melia +5)

- It was a good time. (Melia +2)

- it was okay, I guess. (Melia -1)

She’ll then challenge you to a battle.

<u>Pre-Leader Melia (Golden Forest field)</u>

-   Buneary, Level 15.

    -   Fake Out

    -   Double Hit

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Baby Doll Eyes

-   Wooloo, Level 15.

    -   Double Kick

    -   Tackle

    -   Defense Curl

    -   Copycat

-   Stufful, Level 14.

    -   Tackle

    -   Leer

    -   Roar

    -   Brutal Swing

-   Togepi, Level 15. @Oran Berry.

    -   Ancient Power

    -   Echoed Voice

    -   Yawn

    -   Metronome

Your second-stage starter should be able to make short work of it,
especially paired with Geodude who resists nearly all her attacks, or
Nidorina, who can hit hard with Double Kick. Just be careful to not let
Togepi buff itself up with Ancientpower too many times and you can make
it through.

## Goldenwood Xen Attack - GWXen1

As soon as Melia leaves, head back out through Goldenwood Cave. In the
briefcase, enter 3845 for an *Ability Capsule.* In this game you can
choose from any ability a Pokemon has. Then enter 6489. You’ll get the
*Snag Machine* and *10 Poke Balls!* Just like in Colosseum and XD, all
you must do is use Poke Balls on opponents’ Shadow Pokémon to catch
them. Go ahead and catch the first grunt’s Shadow Meowth**.**

Pair up with Melia and head south. Fight the west grunt to capture
Shadow Finneon**.** Melia won’t battle with you but will heal your
Pokémon if you talk to her. A grunt towards the bottom side of the lake
will have a Shadow **Cacnea.** Head to the bottom part of the lake when
you’re ready.

<u>Team Xen Eli and Sharon (Golden Forest Field)</u>

-   Murkrow, Level 16.

    -   Wing Attack

    -   Pursuit

    -   Confuse Ray

    -   Haze

-   Misdreavus, Level 16.

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Psywave

    -   Spite

    -   Growl

-   Glameow, Level 15.

    -   Feint Attack

    -   Scratch

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Attract

-   Stunky, Level 15.

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Smokescreen

    -   Fury Swipes

    -   Bite

A weak early game team, but you’ll have to get used to the doubles
format present in much of Rejuvenation. Murkrow is the hardest hitter,
while you’ll have to be careful about the status spreading from Glameow
and Stunky.

<u>Team Xen Zetta (Golden Forest Field)</u>

-   Shadow **Snorunt** Level 14.

-   Minior, Level 15.

    -   Rollout

    -   Defense Curl

    -   Confuse Ray

    -   Self-Destruct

-   Quilava, Level 15.

    -   Flame Wheel

    -   Quick Attack

    -   Aerial Ace

    -   Smokescreen

-   Type: Null, Level 18.

    -   Pursuit

    -   Double Hit

    -   Hidden Power: Fighting

    -   Aerial Ace

-   Galarian Meowth, Level 16.

    -   Metal Claw

    -   Pay Day

    -   Fake Out

    -   Hone Claws

Start by capturing Snorunt. Quilava and Meowth should not be too
threatening at this phase as you should have type coverage but watch out
for Minior getting off a Rollout or self-destructing. Type: Null is
bulky at this point in the game, but if you can status it, you’ll be
able to whittle it down.

After witnessing a scene and going north, you’ll be able to fight Rift
Gyarados.

<u>Dimensional Rift Gyarados (Rift Field)</u>

-   Rift Gyarados, Level 20. Type: Water/Ghost. Stat Spread:
    70/110/100/90/78/100. 1 Shield.

    -   Bite

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Ice Fang

    -   Thunder Fang

This is the first of the Rift fights in Rejuvenation. Essentially it has
shield bars like Max Raid Battles in Gen 8 Pokémon. You must deplete the
shield before you can do damage. Luckily though it has no way to recover
lost stats, so being able to use a move like Growl, Charm, or Noble Roar
can really help here. Putting it to sleep is a good way to do this, with
the added benefit on this field of draining health while asleep every
turn. Making it too weak to knock out your Pokémon is the key to
victory. (Winning: +1 Karma) However, the plot will progress even if you
lose.

A couple quick, optional things:

First thing we can do is talk to the grandfather in the train station,
who’ll give you a *Exp. Candy S.*

Head back to Mei and Ayuda to claim your reward for getting all five
cells so far: *TM49 Echoed Voice*!

Return to Jenner’s Lab and head upstairs. You’ll need to battle Madelis’
Houndoom as Melia, using Togepi. It requires a LOT of luck to win.
(Winning: +1 Melia Relationship Point). Losing still progresses the
game. After a lot of cutscenes, you’ll be back outside.

# Chapter 2: Redemption

## Junction Bridge - JBridg1

Head outside of the lab and talk to Karrina. She’ll want us to go to the
Junction Bridge on the left side of the city, so accept fast travel.

Head into the lab to battle Dr. Jenkel.

<u>Mad Scientist Dr. Jenkel (Factory Field)</u>

-   Munna, Level 18. @ Elemental Seed.

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Psybeam

    -   Moonlight

    -   Light Screen

-   Munna, Level 19. @ Elemental Seed.

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Psybeam

    -   Shock Wave

    -   Reflect

-   Musharna, Level 20. @ PULSE Plus. Typing: Psychic/Fairy. Ability:
    Misty Surge. Stat Spread: 115/50/90/90/80/10

    -   Mist Ball

    -   Fairy Wind

    -   Misty Terrain

    -   Wish

Either partner will do well here, his Frogadier hits hard with Water
Pulse and Misty Terrain boosted Icy Wind, while her Grimer can smack
super effective STAB on each with Knock Off and Poison Fang. Low stats
including abysmal speed prevents Musharna from doing much damage - stall
out the screens from the Munna if you need to, take out the Munna and
hit it hard with STAB moves and you’ll be just fine.

After the battle, you’ll be gifted *TM94 Rock Smash!* Use it outside,
down and to the right, and you’ll see a **Blitzle.** Give it a
GourmetTreat and it’ll battle you! On the way out, head into Jenkel’s
lab one more time and pick up 6 *Cell Batteries!* Make sure you save
three of them for a quest in chapter 8.

To the right of Junction Bridge: the sewer stairs there will now be
open. Here you’ll find a Rare Candy. Also:

ZCell 006: Gearen Sewers

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image6.png"
style="width:6.58333in;height:5.01042in" />

Exit through the top. A dumpster on the right has a *Reverse Candy*
within. At night, you can go into the alleyway area. The purple flower
in the center has a *Super Potion,* in between the dumpster and table on
the left is a *Red Shard* and two tiles right and two tiles down from
there is a hidden *Telluric Seed*. The dumpster just before the stairs
contains a *Green Shard,* and the tile between the two stacks of really
tall grass hides a *Super Repel.*

ZCell 007: Gearen Alleyway (Only accessible at night)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image7.png"
style="width:6.69106in;height:5.02604in" />

Go up and give one of the Munna a GourmetTreat to catch it if you want.

One more quest we can do now takes place at the Chrisola Hotel.

-   Enter the room in the right hallway on the right, with Minccino in
    it. Talk to the old lady and agree to find Minccino.

-   Head out to the lobby and find it near the elevator.

-   Enter the left hallway and you’ll see it right away on the bottom
    side

-   Follow it left and around, and you’ll see Team Xen Grunts take it
    away!

-   Go to Gearen Park and fight the Grunts on the east side of the park

-   Return to the old woman, who’ll let you battle to catch
    **Minccino!**

Especially if you’ve been catching all the Pokémon so far, you probably
will have enough AP to get the Golden Hammer. This makes it so we don’t
need to teach Rock Smash to any Pokémon in order to smash rocks!

There are Pokémon in trees in the next area. If you want, bring a
Pokémon with Headbutt to the next area, either Seel or Litleo work
great.

This is all we can do in the city for now, so buy a $300 ticket to take
the train east to Route 2!

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - You guys alright? (Venam -1)  
            - Cheer up, guys... (Ren +1)  
            - ... (Neutral)

## Route 2 - 2Route1

There’s a *Carbos* right and down from the red flower on the left as you
enter. The grassy spot in the middle of dirt right from Meganium hides a
*Green Shard.*

If you use Old Rod, you can only find Finneon here. Remember to to get
Dedenne to continue Zumi’s quest. The next gym is fighting type, so most
of these are going to be decent options for now.

Head down the stairs and go up at the fork. Left of a red flower is a
hidden *Relaxed Mint,* and one tile down from the right patch of two
tall grasses bordering the river is a *Red Shard.* Back down and right
from here, the rightmost isolated grassy tile before the bridge has a
*Blue Shard.*

There are a few more encounter types we can find here with our new field
moves.

Each tree is either a “low” tree or a “high” tree. Low trees have more
infrequent encounters, but typically the rarer Pokémon. North of the
bridge you’ll cross the right tree is a low tree and the left tree is a
high tree. Be wary of Pineco’s Self-Destruct. Diglett will be available
much more easily in the next area.

You can talk to the Aipom across the bridge to catch them instead of
worrying about Headbutt. We’ll want to catch two Aipom here for a trade
later.

If you talk to Kecleon, he’ll sell you stuff. We’ll be back for a side
quest with him later.

<u>Kecleon Market</u>

*Poke Ball* $200

*Potion* $300

*Antidote* $100

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Repel* $350

You can also find a *GourmetTreat* in the rightmost patch of grass up in
the area up from Kecleon, as well as:

ZCell 008: Route 2

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image8.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:4.94792in" />

Cross the bridge to the left, four tiles left of the bottom of the
bridge is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Just up the stairs, two tiles left of
the bottom red flowers is a hidden *Rose Incense.* In the upper corner
three tiles right and two down from the guy there is a hidden *Friend
Ball.* If you talk to the painter here, he’ll wish to see Cherrim. We’ll
return to this quest later.

Heading back and to the right, there is a gold healing star, useful as
we won’t have to run back to the city to heal anymore. To the south past
the fisherman, the tile down and left from the second red flower
contains an *Ability Capsule.*

After you’re done, enter Amethyst Cave.

## Amethyst Cave 1st Visit - ACave1

After a conversation with a shady figure, you’ll have control in the
cave.

Amethyst Cave (Crystal Cavern)

|               |          |                |          |

| **Carbink**   | 2        |                |          |

Go left. Two tiles down and one left from the lady hides a *Nugget.* To
the left pick up the *Quiet Mint,* and the *Mineral Ball* in the bottom
right part of the nearby cart. Down from here, the divot in the wall
contains a *Green Shard.*

Head to the right, and downstairs. This is a new area technically with
different encounters.

Amethyst Depths (Crystal Cavern)

| Diglett     | 9        |
| Carbink     | 2        |

Again, Xatu is another good choice for the upcoming gym.

The wall below the second Joltik contains an *HP Up.* Talk to Ren.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Is that strange? (Ren +1)  
            - What about them? (Neutral)

The rock below him contains a *Potion,* and one tile down from the box
to the left is a hidden *Antidote.* Crossing the bridge, the bottom left
box of the set on the right contains a *Green Shard.* A rock below here
contains a *Resist Wing,* and there is a *Blue Shard* three tiles down
and one tile left.

Head downstairs. The boxes directly left of the healing star contain a
*Revive.* Grab the *Blue Shard.* Then cross the bridge to get a *Modest
Mint.* The tile at the top above the metal tracks contains a *Fire Gem.*
You can give a GourmetTreat to catch **Lunatone**. Activate Panel 1
while you are here, we will activate 5 more for a quest later.

Heal and save, then head up. Pick up the *Rift Dex* to learn about Rift
Galvantula. Partner up with Ren or Venam and take on Rift Galvantula!

<u>Dimensional Rift Galvantula</u>

-   Joltik, Level 22.

    -   Electroweb

    -   Toxic Thread

    -   Struggle Bug

    -   Confusion

    -   Electroweb

    -   Cross Poison

    -   Toxic Thread

    -   Sucker Punch

This one isn’t too bad, though the Joltik are annoying with their
Electroweb attack. Unless you have priority, you’re going to end up
going last, so have something with enough special defense to take their
Electric/Bug/Poison attacks and hit back hard. Venam and Ren are both
worthy partners here.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - You think I can do it? (Neutral)  
            - Where do I go next? (Ren +2)

Back in the city, two optional things we can do now: first, talk to Zumi
in the library, who’ll give you the *Advanced Pokedex* if you caught
Dedenne. She’ll also send you on the next mission to get Drifloon.

Second, if you go to the Chrisola Hotel, our travels to Route 2 will
prompt the girl in the first room in the right hallway to give you
**Shinx!**

Anyways, back in Amethyst Cave, we can head north. Smash the rock and
pick up the hidden *Red Shard* in the rail below. The wall behind a rock
to the right has a *Super Potion,* and the second minecart above
contains a *Mineral Ball.* The rail to the left of this minecart and one
tile up contains a *Green Shard.* To the left, the wall down from the
rock to smash is a *Zinc,* and the machine above here has a *Mineral
Ball.* The wall to the left of the leftmost machine contains a *Reverse
Candy.*

We can’t really access the meadow yet, so head right and up. Talk to the
hooded guy then get a hidden *Electric Gem* in the right rock. In the
next room, the wall immediately on the right contains a *Genius Wing.*
Two tiles down and three left from the first rock smash is a hidden
*Reverse Candy.* On the right side of the room, the top box contains an
*X Attack.* Head through the southeast exit.

A box to the right contains a *Repel.* Down and to the right, the right
side of a drill machine contains an *X Defend* and the last rock
contains a *Rock Gem.* Go immediately to the left in the next room to
get a *Mineral Ball* in the wall. Follow the path until you meet Nim!

In the altered dimension, solve her difficult puzzles and prepare for a
battle.

<u>Apprentice Nim (Psychic Terrain)</u>

-   Inkay, Level 20.

    -   Psywave

    -   Feint Attack

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Swagger

-   Darumaka, Level 20.

    -   Fire Fang

    -   Bite

    -   Headbutt

    -   Taunt

-   Lunatone, Level 21. @ Passho Berry.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Ancientpower

    -   Cosmic Power

    -   Confusion

-   Solrock, Level 21. @ Rindo Berry.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Fire Spin

    -   Psywave

    -   Cosmic Power

The Solrock and Lunatone can be frustrating with Rock Slide, but
anything speedier can knock them out without much difficulty. Inkay
won’t be that much of a threat, so you can probably do well by letting
it sit there while you beat up on the other side. Hidden Power is
boosted in this field, so if you have it on your special attackers,
especially those with type advantages, you’ll be fine.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Yes (Nim +2)  
            - No. (Nim -2)

She’ll give you the *Room ID Card!* When you are back in the cave, the
wall to the left of the bottom stairs contains a *Super Potion,* and the
one above and right of the top stairs contains a *Reverse Candy.* Head
into Sheridan Village to the north.

## Sheridan Village - SVill1

Listen to a cutscene with Aelita and the Elder. At the moment it costs
money to heal here, so we’re gonna start by heading all the way north
into Sheridan Arena. Then knock on Keta’s door at the very top, then
enter the inn back in the village. Head upstairs.

Relationship Point Choices:  
            - I will. (Aelita +3)  
            - Why me?? (Aelita -1)

Now healing is free, so we can explore Sheridan Village now.

Enter the first house and talk to a girl. This opens a quest for way
later.

Go left to enter the shop.

<u>Sheridan Village Shop</u>

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Potion* $300

*Super Potion* $700

*Ice Heal* $250

*Antidote* $100

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Super Repel* $500

*Reverse Candy* $50

Enter the shop on a weekday morning and you’ll see Beth and her Miltank.
Talk to her to get a free *Moomoo Milk* sample, then her shop will open.
Note that Berry Juice can be a pretty good hold item at this stage of
the game.

<u>Sheridan Village Drinks (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday Mornings
Only) (1 Badge)</u>

*Berry Juice* $100

You can sneak around the back of the shop, if you do, talk to the shop
owner from behind to get a *Super Potion!* A tile left and up from the
backdoor on the outside is a hidden *TinyMushroom.*

You’ll notice a trucker up from here: this trucker will drive us for
free between Sheridan and Gearen, so take advantage of this instead of
paying the train fee whenever possible.

Head east. Above the boxes is a hidden *Ability Capsule.* Enter the inn.
Note that the Inn will heal your team for a fee right now, but after a
few story events it will become free. Talk to a girl in the lobby to get
a *Sweet Heart.* Talk to a girl in the first room on the left in the
vertical hallway and take on her quest. The woman on the right in the
hall will offer to teach you a few more moves for shards:

<u>Sheridan Village Move Tutor</u>

Worry Seed 2 Red Shards

Uproar 2 Green Shards

There is an Audino breeder towards the top: every time you beat them,
you will get 3 *Exp. Candy S.* Once you’re ready, we can take care of
some side quests.

At some point, level your Cherubi to Level 25 so that it evolves into
**Cherrim.** On Route 2, in a camper in the far northwest part of the
route, show the guy here your Cherrim for a *Miracle Seed.*

There is a day care in town. Take your Jigglypuff and any other Pokemon
in the Fairy egg group there and breed to get **Igglybuff.** Then, trade
it with a girl in the inn to get a **Smoochum** holding a *Twisted
Spoon!*

Talk to the truck guy and have him take you back to Gearen City. In
Jenner’s lab, use the Room ID Card to get the *Exp. Share!* Read the
note, then talk to Melia’s wardrobe to get the *Audition Tape.* Plug it
in to the computer to watch a lore cutscene if you want.

Head into the Gearen Lab and go to Jenner’s lab. Head to the left and
talk to Professor Hawthorne. He wants a Dex that has seen 100 Pokémon -
this is an easy goal if you haven’t been avoiding all the trainers and
optional battles. Grab either the **Elekid** egg or the **Magby** egg
and read Jenner’s journal if you want.

Talk to him again, and he’ll request a dex with 350 seen. You might not
have this yet but once you do, he’ll offer you the other of the Johto
baby eggs.

Return to Sheridan Arena at the top.

Head up and talk to the **Swablu** flying overhead for a battle. Return
to Keta’s house and talk to him in his garden.

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - I am. (Keta +2)  
            - But i just got here... (Keta -2)

## Amethyst Grotto and Sheridan Help Quests - AGrot1

After accepting Keta’s quest, head all the way out of the village and go
back all the way through Amethyst Cave. In the second room, interact
with this box of plants, then head north. Go to the west side of the
room, where you’ll see a man getting assaulted by **Solrock.** Challenge
it to a battle and catch it to proceed.

Continue through the cave. Once at the entrance, head west until you see
a red rock. Touch the stone, and a door will open. Enter and go
downstairs. On the left above a tree is a hidden *Moon Ball*.

Amethyst Grotto (No Field)

| Meowth        | 31       |
| Jigglypuff    | 25       |
| **Girafarig** | 8        |

On the right side, two tiles right and three tiles above the rock smash
is a hidden *Red Shard.* A rock smash above hides a *Heart Scale* in the
left side of a red tree. On the left, above the stage thing, in the
middle of a red tree is another *Red Shard.*

Once you’re ready, talk to the spirit of Keta. He will give you the
*Soul Stone.* Then exit and watch the scene and fast travel back to
Sheridan.

Returning to the inn in Sheridan you’ll be given $8,000 for saving the
guy.

Now is a good time to do the Sheridan Village Help Quests. The help
center is in the upper right part of the village.

<u>HQuest 8: The Hidden Library 2</u>

-   Start outside the help center and talk to the backpacker.

-   Truck to Gearen, then go to the Chrisola Hotel and talk to Karen in
    front.

-   Head to Dr. Jenkel’s lab and watch the scene

-   Go to Gearen Park and talk to Karen. Enter the library.

-   Pick up the green book behind the pillar at the entrance.

-   Enter the main chamber and pick up the blue book.

We can encounter Pokémon here, but there’s only 1 type: **Unown!**

-   Pick up the purple book nearby. To the right there is a 2-tile space
    without a bookshelf on the bottom, one tile up from the right one
    contains an *Ether.*

-   Go right for the orange book and up for the red book. Also:

ZCell 009: Hidden Library

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image9.png"
style="width:6.66667in;height:5.04167in" />

-   Go down. Pick up the lime book, and *TM63 Embargo.*

-   Head back up and go all the way up, picking up the sky-blue book.

-   Head up. Next to the door, there are candle things. The second from
    the top on the right contains a hidden *Charcoal!*

-   Follow Karen into the north room. On the left, pick up the golden
    book*.* On the right, pick up the lemon book.

-   Now that we have found nine books, head back to where we saw Elgyem
    flying by earlier. Interact with the bookshelf it’s on and place the
    books inside. A level 1 **Elgyem** will then battle you!

-   Head back into the upper room and talk to Karen.

-   While she’ll get the Mega Ring, you’ll get the *Ancient Book.* This
    will allow you to read Garufan prophecies. Check out the ones on the
    wall, if you’re interested.

-   Head back to Sheridan Village when you’re done and talk to the
    backpacker.

-   You can choose to give him the book or not. I recommend giving him
    the book since we can get another later, and if you choose to,
    you’ll get *Blue Moon Ice Cream!*

-   Claim your reward: $950 and *Water Stone*! (+1 Karma, +1 Karen
    Relationship Point)

<u>HQuest 9: Stolen Cargo!</u>

-   Use the trucker to get to Gearen City, then go to Oceana Pier. Head
    to the southeast, then follow the guy into the warehouse.

-   If you try to go north, you’ll get shocked, and your Pokémon will
    faint. The key here is to transform the Factory field into
    Short-Circuit via battling the Electrike trainer in the southwest
    and getting it to use Discharge. Once you’ve done this, head through
    the middle arrows.

-   Venam will join you for a battle. Once you’ve won, she’ll leave.

-   Before we leave the warehouse, interact with the panel to switch the
    direction of the middle tile, then head right. Grab *TM09 Venoshock*
    then head back to Sheridan.

-   Claim your reward: $950 and five *GourmetTreats*. (+1 Karma, +1
    Venam Relationship Point)

<u>HQuest 10: Trade Me!</u>

-   Claim your reward: $1,920 and *Rare Candy*! (+1 Karma)

<u>HQuest 11: Fetch an Item!</u>

-   Start by heading through Amethyst Cave to Route 2.

-   Pick up one of the blue item balls. If you have 50,000, you’re
    welcome to pay for the item, but if not, you’ll get teleported to
    the THIEF’S DUNGEON!

-   After talking to the grunt and getting out, memorize the map on the
    wall. If you don’t take the path outlined, you will get destroyed…
    Enter the door that corresponds to yellow to get an *Ice Stone,* or
    *Dusk Stone* depending on random chance.

-   Escape, and return to the help center. Talk to the guy to get *Blue
    Moon Ice Cream.*

-   Claim your reward: $1890, Casteliacone! (+1 Karma)

Real quick there’s another quest we can do. Take the truck back to
Gearen and enter Karrina’s hideout near the sewers. Talk to her, and
she’ll send us on the gang fight quest. Head to Route 2 and enter
Amethyst Cave.

Head up, and beat the guy at the end to get **Houndour!**

That’s all we can take care of for now, so head back to Sheridan to see
Keta.

## Diamond Punch Badge? - Badge1.5

Gale Strike: Fighting \| Physical \| 60 power \| 100% accuracy \|
Guaranteed critical hit if user is under 50% HP \| On Forest Field,
power is boosted x1.5 and deals additional Grass-type damage.

This battle is the first to really show you how well the trainers
compensate for their type disadvantages here -- almost everything has a
Dark or Rock type move. Scraggy is a good dud to leave out, especially
if you can paralyze it -- it doesn’t do enough damage to really be
threatening at least compared to his other Pokémon. Combusken can be
tough once it outspeeds you, but also has Protect so it might be smart
to focus your attacks on the other Pokémon. A very tough fight but you
have lots of team options to make it more possible.

Sensei runs off instead of paying up a badge. Follow Aelita into the
waterfall cave.

## Carotos Mountain - CMount1

Relationship Point Choices:*  
*            - Yes. (Aelita +1)  
            - No. (Aelita -1)

You’ll team up with Aelita here, so she’ll heal you but catching wild
Pokémon is a bit tougher.

Carotos Mountain (Volcano Field)

|              |          |                |          |
|--------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| <u>Cave</u>  | <u>%</u> | <u>Old Rod</u> | <u>%</u> |
| **Numel**    | 40       | **Numel**      | 70       |
| **Slugma**   | 30       | **Slugma**     | 30       |
| **Onix**     | 19       |                |          |
| **Rolycoly** | 9        |                |          |
| **Nosepass** | 2        |                |          |

On the left, past a rock smash, is *TM121 Fire Spin*.

Once you cross the bridge to the right, prepare for battle and talk to
the robotic looking thing. It will challenge you and has a Shadow
**Ponyta!**

Head through the door, pick up a hidden *Full Heal* in the barrel to the
right, and battle the Xen Grunts. The second grunt will have a Shadow
**Vanillite.** The third has a Shadow **Bonsly.** Defeat SEC and his
Flareon, then pick up the *Red Shard* hidden in the barrel to the right.

If you head to the right, grab the *Ultra Ball* in the left side of the
machine as you go. The bottom left of the four barrels contains a
*Reverse Candy*. Down from here, you can grab *TM43 Flame Charge.*
Observe the passwords written all over the walls in this floor. There is
a *Synthetic Seed* as well as a *Fire Stone* if you follow the path to
the right. Right now, this will evolve Pansear.

SEC will require you to input a password to move on. The passwords are,
in order, BEAUTY, IDOL, SHADOW. Talk to it a few more times and it will
challenge you with a Shadow **Quagsire.**

Once you’re ready, go up the elevator and head towards Madelis’ Palace.
Go inside when you get the chance to, and you’ll team up with Keta.

Head into the left room. Grab the *Hyper Potion* on the left and
*Revive* up above. At the top of the room, grab the *Yellow Key.*

Head back out and go into the right room. Talk to Sharon to get the
*Green Key* and grab the *Fresh Water* in the top right. Talk to **Mime
Jr.** in the top right to take it with you.

Go back and enter the top left room. Grab the *Red Key.*

Finally, enter the top right room. Make sure you grab the *Up-Grade,
Dusk Ball* and the *Blue Key.*

Head back out into the foyer and insert each key into the keyholes on
the walls.

Head up, then up again. You’ll now have to fight Madelis.

<u>Xen Executive Madelis (No Field)</u>

-   Floette, Level 22.

    -   Magical Leaf

    -   Draining Kiss

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Protect

-   Salandit, Level 22.

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Flame Burst

    -   Venoshock

    -   Fake Out

-   Golbat, Level 24.

    -   Wing Attack

    -   Confuse Ray

    -   Double Team

    -   Venoshock

-   Cufant, Level 24.

    -   Iron Head

    -   Stomp

    -   Growl

    -   Rollout

-   Houndoom, Level 25. @ Chople Berry.

    -   Snarl

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Thunder Fang

    -   Crunch

-   Shadow Mewtwo, Level 27.

    -   Energy Ball

    -   Psychic

    -   Miracle Eye

    -   Aura Sphere

    -   Shadow Chill

This one doesn’t have to be won, though it is very doable. Winning
grants +1 Karma and +1 Relationship Point with Madelis. This battle
looks rough, but you’ll have Keta on your side, so it’s functionally a
12 on 6. A rock type can demolish half of her team, and Keta’s fast
fighting Pokémon will help you out. Two of them have fake out, so when
you get to Mewtwo, try to take advantage of those turns to deal heavy
damage to Mewtwo. Mewtwo also takes damage every time it attacks thanks
to Fever Pitch, so take advantage of that and dish out as much damage as
you can as soon as her other Pokémon are all wiped out.

Afterwards, head into the door behind Madelis’ chair, and go down the
lift.

We haven’t had enough legendary battles with only one gym badge quite
yet, so follow Aelita up and grab the *Rift Dex Info.*

After a brief scene, you’ll be taken into a rift space. Talk to
Volcanion and answer its question and the battle will begin!

<u>Dimensional Rift Volcanion</u>

-   Volcanion, Level 23. @ Demon Stone. Ability: Water Absorb. Stat
    Spread: 110/60/80/90/200/20. 2 Shields.

    -   Water Pulse

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Bulldoze

    -   Rock Slide

So, you’ll probably be faster than this guy. With only 110/80 on the
physical side, it’s not too hard to whittle its shields, then its entire
health bar down with some decent STAB moves.

Once you’re free, head to the gate in Sheridan, and enter the spring.

Spring of Purification (Forest Field)

|              |          |                         |          |
|--------------|----------|-------------------------|----------|
| <u>Grass</u> | <u>%</u> | <u>Old Rod/Good Rod</u> | <u>%</u> |
| Bellsprout   | 46       | Goldeen                 | 100      |
| Zigzagoon    | 20       |                         |          |
| Illumise     | 10       |                         |          |
| Volbeat      | 10       |                         |          |
| Paras        | 10       |                         |          |
| Oddish       | 4        |                         |          |

Pick up the *Magical Seed* up from the entrance. Head up and talk to the
pair.

Dialogue Choice:

            - Are you ok? (+1 Karma)  
            - Who’s Vivian? (Neutral)

Once you leave the shrine, Keta will ask you to fast travel to Amethyst
Grotto. If you’re ready, feel free. Otherwise, we now have up to 7 new
Pokémon we can use by purifying them! Shadow Pokémon in Rejuvenation
have moves they can’t normally get, for example Ponyta has Fell Stinger
and Bonsly has Shift Gear. To purify, keep the shadow Pokémon in your
party and run around, or use the Purify Chamber in the PC.

One more thing we can do: head into the house in the bottom right of
Sheridan. Gothitelle will battle us!

<u>Crescent’s Gothitelle (No Field)</u>

-   Gothitelle, Level 32. @ Twisted Spoon.

    -   Psychic

    -   Shock Wave

    -   Calm Mind

    -   Signal Beam

If you win, you’ll be able to pick up **Gothita** behind!

Head into Amethyst Grotto ready for the REAL gym fight.

## Diamond Punch Badge - Badge02

Well, that’s about all we can take care of at this point.

Head back to Amethyst Grotto with a fully healed team.

The Spirit of Keta will be able to give us a badge, so let’s challenge
him.

<u>Sensei Keta (No Field)</u>

-   Larvesta, Level 22

    -   Flame Charge

    -   Take Down

    -   Bug Bite

    -   Magnet Rise

-   Roselia, Level 22. @ Occa Berry.

    -   Magical Leaf

    -   Hidden Power Water

    -   Venoshock

    -   Leech Seed

-   Ninetales, Level 23. @ Charcoal.

    -   Flame Burst

    -   Will-o-Wisp

    -   Hex

    -   Feint Attack

-   Krokorok, Level 23. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Bite

    -   Bulldoze

    -   Hone Claws

    -   Poison Sweep

-   Lapras, Level 24. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Body Slam

    -   Water Pulse

    -   Freeze Dry

    -   Ice Shard

-   Gallade, Level 25. @ Leftovers.

    -   Low Sweep

    -   Psycho Cut

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Poison Sweep

Compared to Novae, this battle won’t be too hard but is still scary.
Gallade hits hard and is fast. In general, you want to try to set up on
one of the weaker Pokémon like Roselia or Larvesta, if you can, it won’t
be too awful.

After you win, you’ll get the Diamond Fist Badge! This enables you to
cut and puts our level cap at 30. He’ll also leave behind *TM103
Stacking Shot.*

Talk to Aelita upstairs and agree to sleep.
