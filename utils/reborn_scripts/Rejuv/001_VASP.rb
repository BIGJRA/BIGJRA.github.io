#
# How A-Star (A*) works:
#
# There's 3 values given to every tile that is being calculated.
# G-Cost = Distance between this tile & starting point.
# H-Cost = Distance between this tile & destination point.
# F-Cost = The sum of G-Cost and H-Cost.
#
# First there's an object made using the event's location (current)
# Until current reaches its destination it calculates the costs for the tiles surrounding it.
# It then stores these in tile objects. These are used to calculate which path is the best route.
# The neighbour is stored and saves the tile that found it as its parent.
# It moves the tile to the tile that has the smallest F-Cost.
# If the tile is impassable it skips that tile.
#
# If there are multiple tiles with the same F-Cost, it should look for the minimum H-Cost.
# If there are multiple tiles with the same F-Cost and H-Cost it should look for the maximum G-Cost. (This should never happen)
#
# If it is stuck (surrounded by impassable tiles) it should stop the calculation.
# It adds every movement calculation to a variable (moveroute)
#
# There's also two arrays that store tiles their data
# Open Tiles = All the tiles that are yet to be calculated
#              But they are still close to the path
# Closed Tiles = All the tiles that benefit the move route
#
# When the tile has reached the goal it stops the loop
# And starts the moveroute for the event.
