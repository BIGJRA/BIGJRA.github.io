# Pokemon Rejuvenation V13.0.5
# Walkthrough Version 13.2.0
# Written by @BIGJRA

I could use some help to double check these things:

- Every battle should have a field listed (including No Field)
- Every encounters area should NOT have a field listed
- 

Welcome to my walkthrough of Pokemon Rejuvenation!

While you're here, try checking out [my Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBx7xQxOKBsEP4k28h-KgQ)! 
I post various fan-game things from time to time. 

Do you have concerns/suggestions/etc? Message me on Discord with 
BIGJRA#3883 or use the [forum thread](https://www.rebornevo.com/forums/topic/44187-rejuvenation-100-walkthrough-discussion-thread-and-link-updated-to-v13/) for discussion. 
If you want to contribute pull requests to the site yourself, please
message me on Discord.

Use CTRL + F to find a specific section. I also oriented this guide as
such that CTRL + F will work for T.M. Names, certain items, Zygarde
cells, tutors, Pokemon Locations, and more!

# Chapter 1: Shipwrecked

## Prologue
To start, the “M” key toggles a speed-up of the game. The game will
start off asking if you want to skip the prologue. Rejuvenation is a
very story-focused game, so I recommend viewing it if it is your first
time playing. If you do skip the prologue, jump ahead to the next
section.

As soon as you're done reading the Zorua and Pangoro story, take control
of Maria and head downstairs to talk to Mom. Afterwards enter the bottom
room on the left side of the first floor and head downstairs and
interact with the summoning table.

Head back upstairs and talk to Dad in the top-left room. Then return to
the kitchen to talk to Mom. After that go upstairs. After a brief flash
and the sound of breaking glass, go back downstairs and talk with the
mysterious figure. Head west back down to the basement to watch the
cutscene.

After regaining control of Marianette, head down, east, and up through
the hallway and watch the final cutscene of the prologue play out.

## S.S. Oceana
After either skipping the prologue or finishing the last cutscene, the
game asks which difficulty mode you'd prefer. Personally, I would
recommend Casual Mode for anyone attempting to do a more restrictive
challenge run or anyone who does not have much experience with the
Reborn-style Pokemon game. I would recommend Normal Mode to anyone
looking for a challenge or who found Reborn's difficulty adequate, and
Intense Mode to those with lots of experience who found Normal / Reborn
too easy, somehow. Regardless of choice, the game allows you to change
your difficulty setting later if you want. **I will be covering battles
in this guide as they appear in Normal Mode.**

Register yourself as a trainer, choosing among genders and six sprites.
Amanda will ask if you want to input a password. I don't recommend using
the password if you've never played the game, since this section
contains many important story beats, but if you do want to skip ahead to
the next section, the password is 4567, though you'll lose out on
potential relationship points with Nancy.

There are two other passwords you can input here. If you want to play as
a legacy protagonist sprite, type 1111. If you want to play the game as
a certain side quest character from later (Ana), type 9494.

Exit the first room and talk to Nancy. This is the first of instances
that get you relationship points with characters, which affect how they
view you. Thanks to Punch for collecting the information about these.
Any dialogue options which are not listed do not affect relationship
points. (Search “Relationship Point” to see them all)

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'm fine. (Mom +2)
- ... (Mom -1)

Once you've talked to Nancy and can roam, explore the S.S. Oceana. In
this game talking to everyone and everything you see can be vital to
discovering new Pokemon and Items, so it's a good idea to talk to
everyone aboard.

Heading to the stairs on the left, in the two rooms you can enter on the
left side, there are two notches in the wall. Interacting with them, you
can listen in on two conversations: one with unknown figures and the
other including Nancy.

Head up the stairs three times to the right to talk to Cpt. Augustus.
He'll explain a few of Rejuvenation's mechanics. Head downstairs and
enter the double doors to the upper middle room. Talk to Nancy to get
the banquet started, when you're ready.

Once you regain control, follow the path and watch the events play out.

## Oceana Pier
After either skipping the boat scenes or watching the cutscenes, talk to
Tesla. Once you regain control, you can explore Oceana Pier.

Now is a good time to change some of your options. I recommend doing
Text Speed Max and Battle Scene Off if you want the game to go
quickly. For a bit more challenge, you can also change the battle mode
to “Set.” I also recommend storing at least a few backups -- save files
can get corrupted.

Anyways, if you want to talk to the woman on the northeast pier, you can
get an all-expenses paid trip to Hoenn, but it is a game over.
Otherwise, there's not too much to do here yet, so head into the gate on
the north side.

## Gearen Laboratory
The trainers won't let you head west or east quite yet, so head into the
building north.

The guy running in place on the left will offer to give you cinematic
bars during important cutscenes if you want. Talk to the girl behind the
counter to buy some basic products.

Gearen Lab Shop

|Item       |Price  |
|-----------|-------|
|*Poke Ball*|$200   |
|*Potion*   |$300   |
|*Repel*    |$350   |
|*Antidote* |$100   |

You start with $1500. I recommend picking up at least a few Poke balls
to catch some team members soon, as a full team is almost necessary to
succeed in Rejuvenation, even as early as the first gym battle of this
game.

Talk to Amanda at the top of the building to see a brief cutscene, then
head up towards the door to meet Melia. Go through the door to meet
Professor Jenner. You'll then get to pick a starter Pokemon by
interacting with it. If you talk to the rainbow-colored machine on the
right side, it will randomly choose for you among the 24 starters.

Starter Choices (Pick ONE)

- **Bulbasaur**
- **Charmander**
- **Squirtle**
- **Chikorita**
- **Cyndaquil**
- **Totodile**
- **Treecko**
- **Torchic**
- **Mudkip**
- **Turtwig**
- **Chimchar**
- **Piplup**
- **Snivy**
- **Tepig**
- **Oshawott**
- **Chespin**
- **Fennekin**
- **Froakie**
- **Rowlet**
- **Litten**
- **Popplio**
- **Grookey**
- **Scorbunny**
- **Sobble**

As in Reborn, Speed Boost Torchic is arguably the strongest choice --
but all the starters can be useful in their own ways. The first gym
specializes in Poison, so the Grass-type starters may be difficult to
use at first. Choose whatever you want though!

You can quick save with ‘D' in front of the Pokemon you choose and use
‘F12' to soft reset for natures, IV's, shininess, and abilities. All
Pokemon in this game have a chance at hidden abilities and the shiny
rate is increased to a little over 1/100.

Anyways, once you've picked your starter, head west for a battle with
Aevium Scout Amanda! You can win or lose this battle.

League Scout Amanda (No Field)

-   Hatenna, Level 5.
    -   Tackle
    -   Play Nice

Note that in this game you can press “S” to check the stats of all the
Pokemon, as well as the weather / field / move effects in play to aid
you in your fights. After the battle, she'll give you *5 Poke Balls.*
Head to talk to Jenner and you'll fight:

Pokemon Trainer Ren (No Field)

-   Froakie, Level 5.
    -   Pound
    -   Growl

After the fight with Ren, Jenner asks you to visit Route 1 to help
Melia. He then gives you the *Pokedex* and the *Cybernav!* Head back
downstairs and listen to Jan's tutorial.

The EV training center can be accessed by talking to the woman on the
right of the counter, but none of its training rooms are open right now.

When you're ready, head back outside to start exploring East Gearen
City!

## Left East Gearen City

This guide will not cover every NPC trainer, but know that as you
explore Aevium there are many!

Patches of grass around Gearen City have opened, so consider catching
some Pokemon to assist your starter.

Left East Gearen City

| Grass: Morning        | %    |Grass: Day     | %    | Grass: Night         | %    |
|-----------------------|------|---------------|------|----------------------|------|
| **Rattata (Alolan)**  | 30   | **Bidoof**    | 30   | **Rattata (Alolan)** | 30   |
| **Wurmple**           | 25   | **Wurmple**   | 25   | **Wurmple**          | 25   |
| **Pidgey**            | 15   | **Pidove**    | 15   | **Poochyena**        | 15   |
| **Patrat**            | 15   | **Patrat**    | 15   | **Hoothoot**         | 15   |
| **Bellsprout**        | 10   | **Bellsprout**| 10   | **Oddish**           | 10   |
| **Sunkern**           | 5    | **Sunkern**   | 5    | **Chingling**        | 5    |

Chingling can help in the fight against the gym dramatically, especially
if you manage to evolve it. However, it is rare-ish here and can be
found much more reliably later.

If you go west on the bottom street, you can find a GourmetTreat in a
bush. We'll want some of these later to get event Pokemon.

If you talk to the nerd on the east side of the bottom street, he'll
give you *Reverse Candy.* The tile to the left of the rightmost tree on
this street has a hidden *Oran Berry* in it. Another *Oran Berry* can be
found immediately below the machine thing on the right street, above
Lacey.

If you go up to the north, left, and down, you can find an *Elemental
Seed* one tile above the left of two trees. There is also a *Resist
Wing* in the grass four spaces to the right.

Heading up to the park, you can find a *Grass Gem* one tile left of the
rightmost bench in the park. Sneaking around the wall to the right,
there is a *Blue Shard* in the side of the building, and on the other
side, an *Escape Rope* in the wall. The tile one down and one right from
the bottom right edge of the fountain has another *Grass Gem*, and
straight to the left the third tile from the edge of the park holds a
*Super Repel.*

You can find a *GourmetTreat* in the wall between two dumpsters on the
north side of the city up one set of stairs, and *Yellow Shard* on the
ground between the two dumpsters to the left of those. Another *Yellow
Shard* is in the rightmost dumpster up another set of stairs.

Head out to the Oceana Pier. You'll find a **Nidoran M** eating. Talk to
it with a GourmetTreat for a battle.

The garden to the south is also now open, so you can catch level 5
**Fletchling** here by interacting with them. If you're interested in
winning even the “impossible” story battles, make sure you catch two,
for their Quick Guard move will help us win one later. The bottom right
grass tile here has a *Sweet Heart,* and there is an *X Accuracy* two
tiles left and one up from there.

Head into the building on the west side that's now unlocked. Talk to the
“man” with the yellow hair, then exit the building and watch Buizel run
by. This starts a quest we'll complete later.

Back in East Gearen, to the left of the lab is the Velvet Building. In
each of the buildings, people will challenge you to battles, so be
warned. Head up to the first floor and talk to the woman in the middle.
If you choose left, she'll give you a *Mineral Ball,* and *Steam Ball*
if you choose right. Also grab the *Great Ball* in the bottom left. If
you enter the second floor, you'll see a **Pachirisu** running wild. If
you give it a GourmetTreat, it'll battle you. There is also a *Potion*
in the corner. Grab the *Exp. Candy XS* on the third floor.

Now go to the Emerald Building on the northeast side of town. Talk to a
girl on the left side to learn about the mystery of the third floor.
You'll need to beat a trainer to access the upper levels. On the second
floor pick up a *Red Shard* in the corner. Talk to a red-haired girl for
a *Full Heal*, and get a *Super Repel* from an old woman. Enter the
third floor to battle a level 5 **Shuppet**.

If you enter the Magnolia Library on the north side of town and pay $300
you can enter the back side of the library. By talking to the man in
glasses you can use the shards hidden around the map for tutor moves.
These aren't very useful, but you can get them for your Pokemon if you
want to.

Library Move Tutor

|Move           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|Bind           |1 Red Shard    |
|Covet          |1 Blue Shard   |
|Helping Hand   |1 Yellow Shard |

The building on the left of the library is the Gearen Help Center. We'll
be returning here later.

After doing all this you may be strong enough to complete the final
quest of this area for now. If you try to cross into the northwest side
of the city, a thug will force you to pay $300 or to battle him. He uses
two Level 12-13 Pokemon, so be sure you're ready. When you win you can
access the northwest area! (+1 Karma, a way for the game to track how
much you help people)

Two tiles up and two tiles right of the grandma on the bench is a hidden
*Red Shard.* Three down and three left of the cop in the top left is a
*Super Potion.*

You can interact with a Nidoran in this map. Follow it to these
locations:

1. First encounter -- northeast by Emerald building.

2. Northwest by train station.

3. East side of the city near bridge, next to dumpster

4. North side, south of library near some dumpsters

After this encounter you can interact with it and battle it. **Nidoran
F** is at level 5.

## Right East Gearen City

You'll see grass around this part of the city too, with more Pokemon.

Right East Gearen City

| Grass: Morning    | %    | Grass: Day    | %    | Grass: Night    | %    |
|-------------------|------|---------------|------|-----------------|------|
| Rattata (Alolan)  | 30   | Bidoof        | 30   | Rattata (Alolan)| 30   |
| **Paras**         | 28   | **Paras**     | 28   | **Jigglypuff**  | 28   |
| Patrat            | 25   | Patrat        | 25   | Poochyena       | 25   |
| Pidgey            | 15   | Pidove        | 15   | Hoothoot        | 15   |
| **Klink**         | 2    | **Klink**     | 2    | **Klink**       | 2    |

Catch a Female Jigglypuff to breed later.

Heading straight up from the entrance, to the left of the machine in the
grass is a hidden *Super Repel,* and the bottom right tile in this
grassy area contains a *Poke Ball.* The bush to the right has a hidden
*Resist Wing.*

To the east, you'll see a *Super Potion* near a tent. Here you'll meet
Mr. Luck -- this is how you change your difficulty, as I mentioned
earlier.

Down and to the left is a machine, one tile up there is a hidden
*Potion.*

The center of the map has a row of shops. I usually sell the Resist
Wings here to get some cash. Here's where you get more GourmetTreats if
you run out. We aren't going to need any Reverse Candies in this game
beyond the ones we find since the level cap is a hard cap unless you use
Rare Candies to go over it.

East Gearen Market Shop: Top-left Vendor

|Item           |Price  |   
|---------------|-------|
|*Poke Ball*    |$200   |
|*Potion*       |$300   |
|*GourmetTreat* |$1500  |
|*Repel*        |$350   |
|*Reverse Candy*|$50    |

East Gearen Market Shop: Bottom-left Vendor

|Item           |Price      |   
|---------------|-----------|
|*Burn Heal*    |$250       |
|*Ice Heal*     |$250       |
|*Antidote*     |$100       |
|*Awakening*    |$250       |
|*Paralyze Heal*|$200       |


Only during the daytime on weekdays there is one more vendor:

East Gearen Market Shop: Bottom-right Vendor

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Reverse Candy*|$50        |
|*Soda Pop*     |$300       |

If you talk to the vendor on the top right, he'll attempt to sell you
Poke Ball's at $400 each. While this may seem like a rip-off, once you
buy four, he'll give you a **Voltorb!**

If you enter the Shopping Emporium above the market vendors, there are a
few shops open for business.

Berry Emporium Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Oran Berry*---|$200       |
|*Pecha Berry*  |$300       |

You can pick up a few of each berry for the gym.

Poke Ball Emporium Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Heavy Ball*   |$300       |
|*Moon Ball*    |$300       |

The Heavy Ball won't be too useful for the beginning portion of the
game. If you haven't captured Jigglypuff or done the Nidoran events,
Moon Balls can be extra useful, but the cheaper, normal balls also 
work fine. The right vendor is currently not in business due to an 
unfulfilled help quest, which we'll get to later.

Heading down a street, three tiles east and one down from the bicycle
shop door you'll find a *Pretty Wing.* In a park to the right, two tiles
left of a skinny tree is a hidden *Repel.* Heading east from here, in
the upper right patch in the grass under some train tracks you'll find
an *Antidote,* and five tiles to the east of the corner of blue liquid
below you, in the street, is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

On the southeast point of the city, if you go west past Karrina, you can
find a *Reverse Candy* hiding in the shade of the tree.

Along the east side of the city, you should see Buizel. His trainer will
show up. Win the battle, and **Buizel** is yours!

North from here, grab an *Iron.* Again, I recommend selling it as $4900
is a lot of money at this point in the game. Down and left from here,
from the bottom end of the blue liquid, five tiles left is a hidden
*Revive.*

Go up towards the Chrisola Resort in the northeast corner of town. Head
east as you get up the stairs and follow the path to get *TM83:
Infestation.* The two flower pots on either side of the door have hidden
*Paralyze Heal* and *Green Shard.*

## Chrisola Resort

Enter the Chrisola Hotel Resort at the top of the map. Entering gives us
a Relationship Point (Saki +1).

After you regain control, talk to a man in the bottom right for a *Super
Potion.* Enter the right hallway and go past the first two rooms and
into the first on the upper side to get *TM126 Whirlpool.* In the
hallway on the left, head into the open room at the top and interact
with the tile down and right from the top left plant for $1500!

Head to the Casino level and talk to the red-haired fellow. They'll
flush their Coin Case down the drain so we can pick it up later.

You've probably noticed a few popups regarding achievements thus far --
complete them and you'll earn AP, redeemable here. For now, we probably
can't get much but I recommend saving up for the HM Items as they'll
make your life a lot easier. The card items will allow you access to EV
Training rooms in Jenner's lab, so those are nice too. The Exp. All
isn't that necessary anymore in this game since there are lots of
grinding options available. Anyways, talk to the girl on the right side
to get an *Achievement Card.*

AP Shop

|Item                   |Price  |
|-----------------------|-------|
|*Adamant Mint*         |3 AP   |
|*Jolly Mint*           |3 AP   |
|*Brave Mint*           |3 AP   |
|*Timid Mint*           |3 AP   |
|*Modest Mint*          |3 AP   |
|*Quiet Mint*           |3 AP   |
|*Calm Mint*            |3 AP   |
|*Bold Mint*            |3 AP   |
|*PP Up*                |6 AP   |
|*Golden Axe*           |10 AP  |
|*Golden Hammer*        |10 AP  |
|*Golden Surfboard*     |15 AP  |
|*Golden Gauntlet*      |15 AP  |
|*Golden Scuba Gear*    |15 AP  |
|*Golden Wings*         |20 AP  |
|*Golden Jetpack*       |20 AP  |
|*Golden Drift Board*   |20 AP  |
|*Golden Claws*         |20 AP  |
|*Exp. All*             |30 AP  |
|*HP Card*              |10 AP  |
|*Atk Card*             |10 AP  |
|*Def Card*             |10 AP  |
|*Speed Card*           |10 AP  |
|*Sp. Atk Card*         |10 AP  |
|*Sp. Def Card*         |10 AP  |

I wouldn't recommend buying any of the first nine items until you get
everything else. Golden Items allow us to use HM's without needing a
Pokemon in the party that has learned them. The Cards allow us to access
EV training rooms. Exp. All is very helpful for grinding, but with the
grinders and Exp. Candies, it may not be the most useful thing for its
high price yet. The cards let you into the basement of the Gearen lab to
do rapid EV training. When you do get access to each EV room, inside
you'll find the respective Power item: *Power Anklet, Power Band, Power
Belt, Power Bracer, Power Lens, Power Weight.*

When I play, I tend to buy the Golden Hammer first, then begin
collecting the Cards. I'll buy the Golden Axe as soon as I get Cut, then
finish with AP cards. Then I'll buy the rest of the Golden Items as I
need them, and the Exp. All when I have enough AP.

Head up to the top floor of the building, Rooftop. There is an Audino
breeder up here: every time you beat them, you will get 3 *Exp. Candy
S.* Combined with the hard level cap, these breeders make level
management in this game a breeze!

Three tiles down and two to the right from the lamppost two to the left
of the breeder is a hidden *Oran Berry.* Two lampposts down from the
breeder, there is a hidden *Resist Wing* four tiles right and one up.
Finally, from the right set of stairs to the helipad two tiles down and
one right has a hidden *Reverse Candy.*

There are Pokemon to encounter here.

Chrisola Rooftop

| Grass: Morning/Day| %    | Grass: Night    | %        |
|-------------------|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Skitty**        | 44   | **Purrloin**    | 44       |
| **Glameow**       | 24   | **Meowth**      | 24       |
| **Caterpie**      | 20   | **Weedle**      | 20       |
| **Meowth**        | 10   | **Glameow**     | 10       |
| Bellsprout        | 2    | Oddish          | 2        |

Once you're done, head back outside. Enter the Aqua Building to the
southwest. On the first floor, pick up the *Old Rod*, as well as another
*Iron*! If you attempt to go to the third floor, you'll enter a really
impossible battle (Level 80!) given the tools we have now. I don't
recommend this unless you have the money and self-respect to spare.

## Gearen Park

Head to the bottom part of this area.

You can find a *Heart Scale* in the wall between two trees on the left.
Two tiles right of the rightmost purple flower is a *TinyMushroom.*
Enter Gearen Park below.

Gearen Park (Grassy Terrain)

| Grass: Morning| %    | Grass: Day    | %    | Grass: Night    | %    |

The first tile below the really tall grass in the second column on the
left of really tall grass has a hidden *Honey.* Straight down, another
*Honey* is three tiles up from the bottom flower. In the left tile of
the tree straight left from the bench here, you'll find a *Carbos.* On
the right side of the park, there is a hidden *Rare Candy* in the second
empty spot among really tall grass from the bottom. Up from here in
between a square of 7 tall grass and a purple flower is a *Blue Shard*,
and 4 tiles up and 2 left is a *Muscle Wing.* Finally in the concrete on
the bottom, in the center two tiles up from the bottom, is a *Yellow
Shard.*

## Sewers Visit 1

To progress the story, head east into Venam's front yard, down from here
a bit, and see a cutscene. Head to the Emporium to get a *Pecha Berry?*
from the attendant. Give it to Venam.

Relationship Point Choices:
- All me. (Venam +2)
- Maybe… (Venam +1)
- No, actually. (Neutral)

Head to the southeast of town and a cutscene will play. Afterwards
follow Venam into the sewers. You'll be teaming up with Ren here, who
will heal your Pokemon after every battle. Additionally, if you try to
catch Pokemon while with Ren, you'll need to knock one of the two out in
order to catch the other, which can be frustrating.

Anyways, there are lots of new Pokemon here:

Abandoned Sewers

| Cave             | %    | Old Rod    | %    |
|------------------|------|------------|------|
| Rattata (Alolan) | 30   | **Grimer** | 100  |
| **Trubbish**     | 20   |            |      |
| Poochyena        | 15   |            |      |
| **Gulpin**       | 10   |            |      |
| **Ekans**        | 10   |            |      |
| **Koffing**      | 9    |            |      |
| **Noibat**       | 5    |            |      |
| **Geodude**      | 1    |            |      |

Head left, and on the second tile from left at the bottom is a hidden
*Poison Gem.* Head across the bridge and right to get a *Great Ball.* Go
up and before crossing the bridge, there is a hidden *Zinc* in the
bottom right corner. Talk to a bug catcher to get a *Pecha Berry.* To
the right is a *Bold Mint.* Above the girl to the left is a hidden
*Potion* and in the thing to the right is another *Potion.*

Heading back down and crossing to the left, if the guy flushed it at the
Hotel, go left and all the way down to grab the *Coin Case!* The corner
to the right and down has a hidden *Reverse Candy.*

Attempt to enter the room Venam runs into and it will lock you out.
There's an *Antidote* to the left.

Head back across the bridge, up and left to the generator room. Start
the third, first, then second generator. Go back into the room Venam
went into for a long cutscene and a battle.

Garbodor Garbage Crew (No Field)

-   Trubbish, Level 11.
    -   Pound
    -   Poison Gas
    -   Recycle
    -   Tackle
-   Trubbish, Level 12.
    -   Pound
    -   Poison Gas
    -   Recycle
    -   Tackle
-   Garbodor, Level 13.
    -   Pound
    -   Poison Gas
    -   Toxic Spikes

Knocking out the Trubbish makes this a two-on-one. Any of your new
Poison-types should be able to resist getting poisoned here, but really
any strong STAB moves can take out the Trubbish. Ren's Growlithe hits
hard with Ember, plus he has two more in the back, so you shouldn't
really have to worry here.

## Game Corner Prizes

Now's a good time to mention all the prizes available in the game
corner. While you can get them all right now with enough patience, it's
not necessary to grab everything right now.

Anyways, there's a grand total of 120 coins along the ground in there,
try to find them all. Otherwise, here's what you can get here:

Game Corner Coin Vendor Shop

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|50 Coins   |$1000     |
|500 Coins  |$10000    |


Game Corner Left Vendor Shop

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*TM70 Flash*       |1000 Coins |
|*TM10 Hidden Power*|5000 Coins |

Game Corner Right Vendor Shop

|Item          |Price      |
|--------------|-----------|
|**Seel**      |1000 Coins |
|**Spoink**    |4000 Coins |
|**Maractus**  |5000 Coins |
|**Helioptile**|6500 Coins |

To get coins you can buy them or play the various games in the casino.
Of these, Voltorb Flip is easily the most efficient once you know what
you're doing... but with the luck involved it will take quite a while
still. I recommend getting Spoink for the gym and Hidden Power in order
to spice up your early game movesets, but it's up to you.

The attendant on the left is the lotto corner lady, who'll pick one
number a day and check if it matches your Pokemon's, like in the
official games. The prizes are as follows:

Loto Attendant

|Prize          |Digits Matched|
|---------------|--------------|
|*Master Ball*  |5 Matches     |
|*Max Revive*   |4 Matches     |
|*Exp. Share*   |3 Matches     |
|*PP Up*        |2 Matches     |
|*Ultra Ball*   |1 Matches     |

Anyways, once you've gambled to your heart's content, there is a bit
more optional stuff to do if you want.

In Gearen Park, talk to Melia for an optional scene for Relationship
Points (Melia +3).

Relationship Point Choices:
- You like photography? (Melia +1)
- What are you doing? (Neutral)

Relationship Point Choices:
- I love photography! (Melia +2)
- I appreciate the art! (Melia +1)
- It's not for me. (Neutral)
- Photography's boring. (Melia -2)

Additionally, head back to Magnolia Library, and for a short time you'll
be able to battle Ren -- it's optional experience and money should you
want it.

## PoisonHeart Badge

It's time to take on Venam's gym in East Gearen. This gym will require
us to mix colors to make composite colors.

Take out the first trainer and learn the color combination we need to
build is Magenta. To mix magenta, add red and blue.

In the second room, we're going to make orange and green. Do red and
yellow first, then check the machine. Then do teal and yellow to make
green and move into the third room.

The trainer in the next room will tell you to make Orange, White, and
Teal.

The first is red + yellow, and the second is green + red + blue.
Finally, add just green + blue and we're in.

Well, that would be all we have to do, but there's a secret. If you mix
brown, then white, then orange, you'll get access to a secret area. A
fun fact: the Seviper and Venipede boarded up gyms are versions of
Venam's gym from older versions of Rejuvenation!

After emerging, two tiles to the left of the top dumpster is a hidden
*Psychic Gem.* Up the stairs all the way left is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

In the upper left corner here, you can find a hidden *Rare Candy!* One
tile down and 4 right is a hidden *Red Shard.* Here too is a **Seviper**
Egg as well as a *Fresh Water* hidden 4 tiles right of it.

Gearen Alleyway

| Grass        | %        |
|--------------|----------|
| **Sentret**  | 30       |
| Poochyena    | 20       |
| **Rattata**  | 20       |
| **Drowzee**  | 15       |
| **Munna**    | 6        |
| Pidgey       | 5        |
| Patrat       | 4        |

Well, that's about it for that area, so clear your team, equip all the
good items you can take advantage of (Oran and Pecha Berries work well
here), and save.

Punk Girl Venam (Corrosive Field)

-   Trubbish, Level 12. @ Oran Berry.
    -   Rock Blast
    -   Venam's Kiss
    -   Thief
    -   Poison Gas
-   Mareanie, Level 12
    -   Bite
    -   Recover
    -   Water Pulse
    -   Toxic Spikes
-   Ivysaur, Level 13. @ Oran Berry.
    -   Venam's Kiss
    -   Poisonpowder
    -   Razor Leaf
    -   Leech Seed
-   Alolan Grimer, Level 13. @ Oran Berry.
    -   Bite
    -   Acid Armor
    -   Poison Fang
    -   Shadow Sneak
-   Whirlipede, Level 14.
    -   Twineedle
    -   Venom Drench
    -   Protect
    -   Venoshock
-   Seviper, Level 15. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Bite
    -   Bulldoze
    -   Glare
    -   Venam's Kiss

Venam's Kiss: Poison \| Physical \| 75 power \| 100% accuracy \| 10%
chance to poison, super-effective against Steel-types.

Honestly, this one isn't too bad. If you've picked up Chingling or
Spoink, they can wreck the house here. Marshtomp, my starter, helped as
well, though Mud Shot gains Poison typing on the field. Ultimately this
is not too bad and if you're really struggling with an under leveled
team you can push them to the Lv. 18 cap and win by sheer stat
advantage.

After the battle, you'll be rewarded with the *PoisonHeart Badge*!
She'll also give you *TM102 Poison Sweep!* This is a new move that can
be useful in the early game.

## Post-Gym Quests

Some quests have opened, everything in this section is optional though.

Return to Gearen Lab. The girl by the PC will gift you an **Aevian
Feebas** from Jan! How nice of him.

Head to the Magnolia Library. Talk to the guard of the stairs to the
right. As you have a badge, she'll let you pass.

Upstairs, you'll find a Black Belt who will offer to teach more tutor
moves for shards.

Library 2F Move Tutor

|Move       |Price          |
|-----------|---------------|
|Dual Chop  |2 Yellow Shards|
|Block      |2 Blue Shards  |
|Super Fang |2 Red Shards   |

Of these, Super Fang can be useful for catching Pokemon, and Dual Chop
can give you coverage against Dragon types if you really need it.

Talk to the girl on the right. This is Zumi, and she'll start us on a
Pokedex collection quest. We'll be back once we catch a Dedenne for her.

Head into Venam's house south of the hotel. If you head upstairs, you'll
find a *Poison Barb.*

Back in Gearen Park, now you'll be able to give a treat to
**Gossifleur** for a battle!

Head back to Gearen Lab and talk to the girl sitting by the computer on
the left. Now that we have a badge, she'll ask for some help with an
online fangame league. She'll then give you a *Badge Card.* Talk to her
again and agree to help.

Your first battle is against Falkner.

Gym Leader Falkner (Glitch Field)

-   Hoothoot, Level 11.
    -   Confusion
    -   Peck
    -   Hypnosis
-   Noctowl, Level 12.
    -   Confusion
    -   Peck
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Echoed Voice

I am using Cyndaquil and Onix. Use Ember and Rock Tomb and you should
come out on top. If you win, you'll get a *Virtual Badge.* That's all
she needs for now, we'll come back after we have two badges.

One shop has updated inventory now that we have a badge. Head to the
Shopping Emporium.

Poke Ball Emporium Shop: New Items (1 Badge)

|Item       |Price  |
|-----------|-------|
|*Love Ball*|$300   |
|*Fast Ball*|$300   |

Love Balls are a very useful ball for their price, just pay attention to
the gender of what you're trying to catch.

Now's a good time to start taking on the Help Center quests, so head
into the help center. You'll be approached by Ayuda, who'll give you a
quest to collect Zygarde cells. He'll give you the *Gather Cube* to
begin this quest. We will finish the help quests first, then get the
cells.

### HQuest 1: Help Starly

Start at Gearen Lab. Talk to the black-haired girl next to Nurse Joy.

If you win, accept **Litleo** in your team!

Claim your reward at the help center: $350 and *Super Potion!* (+1 Karma)

Anyways, all that's left is to claim your reward at the help center --
$350 and **Pichu!** (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 7: Wretched Music

Talk to the receptionist at the Chrisola Hotel and agree to go to
the basement.

can be threatening if it sets up. This battle isn't super hard with a
good flying type or two, or probably most well-rounded sixes.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You should stop. (RorimB -1)
- Yeah, he's a jerk. (RorimB +2)
- The other guests...? (RorimB +1)

Upstairs, talk to the bell boy in the left hallway, and the girl in the
top-left room in the right hallway.

style="width:6.65625in;height:5.02083in" />

## Route 1 and Goldenwood Forest

Once you're ready to leave, head to the northwest part of town and enter
the train station. Inside the station, you'll meet up with Tesla, who'll
buy you a ticket and give you *Potions.* Talk to the grandfather in the
station and agree to help him, then board the train. 

Route 1

| Grass: Morning| %    | Grass: Day    | % | Grass: Night    | %    |
|---------------|------|---------------|---|-----------------|------|
| Caterpie      | 30   | Pidove        | 30| **Scatterbug**  | 35   | 
| Sentret       | 29   | **Scatterbug**| 30| Pidove          | 30   |

|Old Rod    |%  |
|-----------|---|
|**Finneon**|100|

The tree to the left of the second red flower from the train has a
hidden *Potion.* Grab the *Super Repel* and the *Jolly Mint* above.

You'll see a **Whismur** nearby. If you give it a GourmetTreat, it'll
battle you!

ZCell 005: Route 1

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image5.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.02083in" />

Head north and enjoy a great cutscene montage with Melia. Once you
regain control, interact with Drifblim.

Relationship Point Choices:
- It was no bother! (Narcissa +1)
- It was a complete bother. (Narcissa -1)

You'll get an *HP Up.* Another free $4900! Grab the nearby *Potion* as
well and talk to the Furfrou lady for another *Potion.*

Goldenwood Forest

| Grass        | %    | Old Rod| %    |
|--------------|------|--------|------|
| Poochyena    | 30   | Finneon| 100  |
| Sentret      | 24   |        |      |
| Deerling     | 20   |        |      |
| **Spewpa**   | 15   |        |      |
| Pidove       | 10   |        |      |
| Furret       | 1    |        |      |

There are some trainers south to battle. When you're ready, head north
into Goldenwood Cave.

Melia will join your party here.

Goldenwood Cave

| Cave        | %    |
|-------------|------|
| Geodude     | 49   |
| Noibat      | 34   |
| **Woobat**  | 15   |
| Furret      | 2    |

Woobat is good for the next gym.

To the right, one of the rocks contains a hidden *Red Shard.* The tile
right of a skinny tree above the steps has a *TinyMushroom,* and the top
left rock as you head down the left stairs has a *Blue Shard.* The top
left rock in the area past the bridge hides a *Potion,* and if you head
up to the top area on the right, one tile down and three right of the
skinny tree is a *TinyMushroom,* while another *TinyMushroom* is a tile
left of the top of two red flowers on the right. Heading back to the
top, the rock below Leavanny has a *Great Ball.* If you can, do the
optional battle against Mars here.

Culvier Clan Mars (Cave Field)

-   Sewaddle, Level 15. @ Light Clay.
    -   Return
    -   Bug Bite
    -   Seed Bomb
    -   Light Screen
-   Swadloon, Level 18. @ Miracle Seed.
    -   Return
    -   Iron Defense
    -   Seed Bomb
    -   Double Team
-   Leavanny, Level 20. @ Leftovers.
    -   Return
    -   Seed Bomb
    -   Synthesis
    -   Iron Defense

Fire and Flying moves obviously work great here if you can stall out the
Light Screen and/or avoid Iron Defense bulk. If you do manage to
succeed, you'll get a *Star Shard* and a **Sewaddle**!

If you follow Melia, you'll appear in a small room. Interact with the
rock at the top for a *PP Up!* I don't recommend using this on your weak
moves just yet, either save it or sell it for $4900.

Make sure you've caught everything you care to in the whole Goldenwood
Forest/Cave area, as we won't be able to come back for a little while.

Anyways, heal your team and talk to Melia.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I will cherish it too! (Melia +5)
- It was a good time. (Melia +2)
- it was okay, I guess. (Melia -1)

She'll then challenge you to a battle.

Pre-Leader Melia (Golden Forest field)

-   Buneary, Level 15.
    -   Fake Out
    -   Double Hit
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Baby Doll Eyes
-   Wooloo, Level 15.
    -   Double Kick
    -   Tackle
    -   Defense Curl
    -   Copycat
-   Stufful, Level 14.
    -   Tackle
    -   Leer
    -   Roar
    -   Brutal Swing
-   Togepi, Level 15. @Oran Berry.
    -   Ancient Power
    -   Echoed Voice
    -   Yawn
    -   Metronome

Your second-stage starter should be able to make short work of it,
especially paired with Geodude who resists nearly all her attacks, or
Nidorina, who can hit hard with Double Kick. Just be careful to not let
Togepi buff itself up with Ancientpower too many times and you can make
it through.

## Goldenwood Xen Attack

As soon as Melia leaves, head back out through Goldenwood Cave. In the
briefcase, enter 3845 for an *Ability Capsule.* In this game you can
choose from any ability a Pokemon has. Then enter 6489. You'll get the
*Snag Machine* and *10 Poke Balls!* Just like in Colosseum and XD, all
you must do is use Poke Balls on opponents' Shadow Pokemon to catch
them. Go ahead and catch the first grunt's Shadow Meowth**.**

Pair up with Melia and head south. Fight the west grunt to capture
Shadow Finneon**.** Melia won't battle with you but will heal your
Pokemon if you talk to her. A grunt towards the bottom side of the lake
will have a Shadow **Cacnea.** Head to the bottom part of the lake when
you're ready.

Team Xen Eli and Sharon (Golden Forest Field)

-   Murkrow, Level 16.
    -   Wing Attack
    -   Pursuit
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Haze
-   Misdreavus, Level 16.
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Psywave
    -   Spite
    -   Growl
-   Glameow, Level 15.
    -   Feint Attack
    -   Scratch
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Attract
-   Stunky, Level 15.
    -   Poison Gas
    -   Smokescreen
    -   Fury Swipes
    -   Bite

A weak early game team, but you'll have to get used to the doubles
format present in much of Rejuvenation. Murkrow is the hardest hitter,
while you'll have to be careful about the status spreading from Glameow
and Stunky.

Team Xen Zetta (Golden Forest Field)

-   Shadow **Snorunt** Level 14.
-   Minior, Level 15.
    -   Rollout
    -   Defense Curl
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Self-Destruct
-   Quilava, Level 15.
    -   Flame Wheel
    -   Quick Attack
    -   Aerial Ace
    -   Smokescreen
-   Type: Null, Level 18.
    -   Pursuit
    -   Double Hit
    -   Hidden Power: Fighting
    -   Aerial Ace
-   Galarian Meowth, Level 16.
    -   Metal Claw
    -   Pay Day
    -   Fake Out
    -   Hone Claws

Start by capturing Snorunt. Quilava and Meowth should not be too
threatening at this phase as you should have type coverage but watch out
for Minior getting off a Rollout or self-destructing. Type: Null is
bulky at this point in the game, but if you can status it, you'll be
able to whittle it down.

After witnessing a scene and going north, you'll be able to fight Rift
Gyarados.

Dimensional Rift Gyarados (Rift Field)

-   Rift Gyarados, Level 20. Type: Water/Ghost. Stat Spread:
    70/110/100/90/78/100. 1 Shield.
    -   Bite
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Ice Fang
    -   Thunder Fang

This is the first of the Rift fights in Rejuvenation. Essentially it has
shield bars like Max Raid Battles in Gen 8 Pokemon. You must deplete the
shield before you can do damage. Luckily though it has no way to recover
lost stats, so being able to use a move like Growl, Charm, or Noble Roar
can really help here. Putting it to sleep is a good way to do this, with
the added benefit on this field of draining health while asleep every
turn. Making it too weak to knock out your Pokemon is the key to
victory. (Winning: +1 Karma) However, the plot will progress even if you
lose.

A couple quick, optional things:

First thing we can do is talk to the grandfather in the train station,
who'll give you a *Exp. Candy S.*

Head back to Mei and Ayuda to claim your reward for getting all five
cells so far: *TM49 Echoed Voice*!

Return to Jenner's Lab and head upstairs. You'll need to battle Madelis'
Houndoom as Melia, using Togepi. It requires a LOT of luck to win.
(Winning: +1 Melia Relationship Point). Losing still progresses the
game. After a lot of cutscenes, you'll be back outside.

# Chapter 2: Redemption

## Junction Bridge

Head outside of the lab and talk to Karrina. She'll want us to go to the
Junction Bridge on the left side of the city, so accept fast travel.

Head into the lab to battle Dr. Jenkel.

Mad Scientist Dr. Jenkel (Factory Field)

-   Munna, Level 18. @ Elemental Seed.
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Psybeam
    -   Moonlight
    -   Light Screen
-   Munna, Level 19. @ Elemental Seed.
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Psybeam
    -   Shock Wave
    -   Reflect
-   Musharna, Level 20. @ PULSE Plus. Typing: Psychic/Fairy. Ability:
    Misty Surge. Stat Spread: 115/50/90/90/80/10
    -   Mist Ball
    -   Fairy Wind
    -   Misty Terrain
    -   Wish

Either partner will do well here, his Frogadier hits hard with Water
Pulse and Misty Terrain boosted Icy Wind, while her Grimer can smack
super effective STAB on each with Knock Off and Poison Fang. Low stats
including abysmal speed prevents Musharna from doing much damage - stall
out the screens from the Munna if you need to, take out the Munna and
hit it hard with STAB moves and you'll be just fine.

After the battle, you'll be gifted *TM94 Rock Smash!* Use it outside,
down and to the right, and you'll see a **Blitzle.** Give it a
GourmetTreat and it'll battle you! On the way out, head into Jenkel's
lab one more time and pick up 6 *Cell Batteries!* Make sure you save
three of them for a quest in chapter 8.

To the right of Junction Bridge: the sewer stairs there will now be
open. Here you'll find a Rare Candy. Also:

ZCell 006: Gearen Sewers

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image6.png"
style="width:6.58333in;height:5.01042in" />

Exit through the top. A dumpster on the right has a *Reverse Candy*
within. At night, you can go into the alleyway area. The purple flower
in the center has a *Super Potion,* in between the dumpster and table on
the left is a *Red Shard* and two tiles right and two tiles down from
there is a hidden *Telluric Seed*. The dumpster just before the stairs
contains a *Green Shard,* and the tile between the two stacks of really
tall grass hides a *Super Repel.*

ZCell 007: Gearen Alleyway (Only accessible at night)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image7.png"
style="width:6.69106in;height:5.02604in" />

Go up and give one of the Munna a GourmetTreat to catch it if you want.

One more quest we can do now takes place at the Chrisola Hotel.

Enter the room in the right hallway on the right, with Minccino in it. 
Talk to the old lady and agree to find Minccino.

Head out to the lobby and find it near the elevator. Then enter the left
hallway and you'll see it right away on the bottom side. Follow it left 
and around, and you'll see Team Xen Grunts take it away!

Go to Gearen Park and fight the Grunts on the east side of the park.

Return to the old woman, who'll let you battle to catch **Minccino!**

Especially if you've been catching all the Pokemon so far, you probably
will have enough AP to get the Golden Hammer. This makes it so we don't
need to teach Rock Smash to any Pokemon in order to smash rocks!

There are Pokemon in trees in the next area. If you want, bring a
Pokemon with Headbutt to the next area, either Seel or Litleo work
great.

This is all we can do in the city for now, so buy a $300 ticket to take
the train east to Route 2!

Relationship Point Choices:  
- You guys alright? (Venam -1)  
- Cheer up, guys... (Ren +1)  
- ... (Neutral)

## Route 2

There's a *Carbos* right and down from the red flower on the left as you
enter. The grassy spot in the middle of dirt right from Meganium hides a
*Green Shard.*

Route 2

| Grass: Morning| %    |Grass: Day    | %    | Grass: Night    | %    | 
|---------------|------|--------------|------|-----------------|------|-
| Deerling      | 30   |**Cherubi**   | 48   | **Swirlix**     | 30   |

| **Swirlix**   | 1    |              |      | Chingling       | 2    | 

| Old Rod   | % |
|-----------|---|
| Finneon   |100|

Remember to to get Dedenne to continue Zumi's quest. The next gym is 
fighting type, so most of these are going to be decent options for now.

Head down the stairs and go up at the fork. Left of a red flower is a
hidden *Relaxed Mint,* and one tile down from the right patch of two
tall grasses bordering the river is a *Red Shard.* Back down and right
from here, the rightmost isolated grassy tile before the bridge has a
*Blue Shard.*

There are a few more encounter types we can find here with our new field
moves.

Route 2

| Headbutt Low      | % | Headbutt High | % | Rock Smash | % |
|-------------------|---|---------------|---|------------|---|
| **Aipom**         | 55| Caterpie      | 55| Geodude    | 96|
| **Crabrawler**    | 20| Weedle        | 30| **Diglett**| 4 |
| **Pineco**        | 10| **Pineco**    | 5 |            |   |
| **Butterfree**    | 5 | Pidgey        | 5 |            |   |
| **Burmy**         | 5 | **Crabrawler**| 4 |            |   |
| Metapod           | 4 | **Aipom**     | 1 |            |   |
| **Beedrill**      | 1 |               |   |            |   |

Each tree is either a “low” tree or a “high” tree. Low trees have more
infrequent encounters, but typically the rarer Pokemon. North of the
bridge you'll cross the right tree is a low tree and the left tree is a
high tree. Be wary of Pineco's Self-Destruct. Diglett will be available
much more easily in the next area.

You can talk to the Aipom across the bridge to catch them instead of
worrying about Headbutt. We'll want to catch two Aipom here for a trade
later.

If you talk to Kecleon, he'll sell you stuff. We'll be back for a side
quest with him later.

Kecleon Market Shop

|Item           | Price     |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Poke Ball*    | $200      |
|*Potion*       | $300      |
|*Antidote*     | $100      |
|*GourmetTreat* | $1500     |
|*Repel*        | $350      |

You can also find a *GourmetTreat* in the rightmost patch of grass up in
the area up from Kecleon, as well as:

ZCell 008: Route 2

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image8.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:4.94792in" />

Cross the bridge to the left, four tiles left of the bottom of the
bridge is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Just up the stairs, two tiles left of
the bottom red flowers is a hidden *Rose Incense.* In the upper corner
three tiles right and two down from the guy there is a hidden *Friend
Ball.* If you talk to the painter here, he'll wish to see Cherrim. We'll
return to this quest later.

Heading back and to the right, there is a gold healing star, useful as
we won't have to run back to the city to heal anymore. To the south past
the fisherman, the tile down and left from the second red flower
contains an *Ability Capsule.*

After you're done, enter Amethyst Cave.

## Amethyst Cave 1st Visit

After a conversation with a shady figure, you'll have control in the
cave.

Amethyst Cave

| Cave          | %        | Old Rod        | %        |
|---------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Woobat        | 40       | **Remoraid**   | 70       |
| Geodude       | 34       | **Barboach**   | 30       |
| **Sandshrew** | 15       |                |          |
| Diglett       | 9        |                |          |
| **Carbink**   | 2        |                |          |

Go left. Two tiles down and one left from the lady hides a *Nugget.* To
the left pick up the *Quiet Mint,* and the *Mineral Ball* in the bottom
right part of the nearby cart. Down from here, the divot in the wall
contains a *Green Shard.*

Head to the right, and downstairs. This is a new area technically with
different encounters.

Amethyst Depths

| Cave        | %        |
|-------------|----------|
| Geodude     | 34       |
| Chingling   | 30       |
| Sandshrew   | 15       |
| **Natu**    | 10       |
| Diglett     | 9        |
| Carbink     | 2        |

Again, Xatu is another good choice for the upcoming gym.

The wall below the second Joltik contains an *HP Up.* Talk to Ren.

Relationship Point Choices:
    
- Is that strange? (Ren +1)  
- What about them? (Neutral)

The rock below him contains a *Potion,* and one tile down from the box
to the left is a hidden *Antidote.* Crossing the bridge, the bottom left
box of the set on the right contains a *Green Shard.* A rock below here
contains a *Resist Wing,* and there is a *Blue Shard* three tiles down
and one tile left.

Head downstairs. The boxes directly left of the healing star contain a
*Revive.* Grab the *Blue Shard.* Then cross the bridge to get a *Modest
Mint.* The tile at the top above the metal tracks contains a *Fire Gem.*
You can give a GourmetTreat to catch **Lunatone**. Activate Panel 1
while you are here, we will activate 5 more for a quest later.

Heal and save, then head up. Pick up the *Rift Dex* to learn about Rift
Galvantula. Partner up with Ren or Venam and take on Rift Galvantula!

Dimensional Rift Galvantula (Corrupted Field)

-   Joltik, Level 22.
    -   Electroweb
    -   Toxic Thread
    -   Struggle Bug
    -   Confusion
-   Joltik, Level 23.
    -   Electroweb
    -   Toxic Thread
    -   Struggle Bug
    -   Confusion
-   Joltik, Level 24.
    -   Electroweb
    -   Toxic Thread
    -   Struggle Bug
    -   Confusion
-   Joltik, Level 25.
    -   Electroweb
    -   Toxic Thread
    -   Struggle Bug
    -   Confusion
-   Galvantula, Level 25. @ Demon Stone. Ability: Parental Bond. Type:
    Poison/Electric. Stat Spread: 70/80/100/80/160/80
    -   Electroweb
    -   Cross Poison
    -   Toxic Thread
    -   Sucker Punch

This one isn't too bad, though the Joltik are annoying with their
Electroweb attack. Unless you have priority, you're going to end up
going last, so have something with enough special defense to take their
Electric/Bug/Poison attacks and hit back hard. Venam and Ren are both
worthy partners here.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You think I can do it? (Neutral)  
- Where do I go next? (Ren +2)

Back in the city, two optional things we can do now: first, talk to Zumi
in the library, who'll give you the *Advanced Pokedex* if you caught
Dedenne. She'll also send you on the next mission to get Drifloon.

Second, if you go to the Chrisola Hotel, our travels to Route 2 will
prompt the girl in the first room in the right hallway to give you
**Shinx!**

Anyways, back in Amethyst Cave, we can head north. Smash the rock and
pick up the hidden *Red Shard* in the rail below. The wall behind a rock
to the right has a *Super Potion,* and the second minecart above
contains a *Mineral Ball.* The rail to the left of this minecart and one
tile up contains a *Green Shard.* To the left, the wall down from the
rock to smash is a *Zinc,* and the machine above here has a *Mineral
Ball.* The wall to the left of the leftmost machine contains a *Reverse
Candy.*

We can't really access the meadow yet, so head right and up. Talk to the
hooded guy then get a hidden *Electric Gem* in the right rock. In the
next room, the wall immediately on the right contains a *Genius Wing.*
Two tiles down and three left from the first rock smash is a hidden
*Reverse Candy.* On the right side of the room, the top box contains an
*X Attack.* Head through the southeast exit.

A box to the right contains a *Repel.* Down and to the right, the right
side of a drill machine contains an *X Defend* and the last rock
contains a *Rock Gem.* Go immediately to the left in the next room to
get a *Mineral Ball* in the wall. Follow the path until you meet Nim!

In the altered dimension, solve her difficult puzzles and prepare for a
battle.

Apprentice Nim (Psychic Terrain)

-   Inkay, Level 20.
    -   Psywave
    -   Feint Attack
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Swagger
-   Darumaka, Level 20.
    -   Fire Fang
    -   Bite
    -   Headbutt
    -   Taunt
-   Lunatone, Level 21. @ Passho Berry.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Ancientpower
    -   Cosmic Power
    -   Confusion
-   Solrock, Level 21. @ Rindo Berry.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Fire Spin
    -   Psywave
    -   Cosmic Power

The Solrock and Lunatone can be frustrating with Rock Slide, but
anything speedier can knock them out without much difficulty. Inkay
won't be that much of a threat, so you can probably do well by letting
it sit there while you beat up on the other side. Hidden Power is
boosted in this field, so if you have it on your special attackers,
especially those with type advantages, you'll be fine.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes (Nim +2)  
- No. (Nim -2)

She'll give you the *Room ID Card!* When you are back in the cave, the
wall to the left of the bottom stairs contains a *Super Potion,* and the
one above and right of the top stairs contains a *Reverse Candy.* Head
into Sheridan Village to the north.

## Sheridan Village

Listen to a cutscene with Aelita and the Elder. At the moment it costs
money to heal here, so we're gonna start by heading all the way north
into Sheridan Arena. Then knock on Keta's door at the very top, then
enter the inn back in the village. Head upstairs.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I will. (Aelita +3)  
- Why me?? (Aelita -1)

Now healing is free, so we can explore Sheridan Village now.

Enter the first house and talk to a girl. This opens a quest for way
later.

Go left to enter the shop.

Sheridan Village Shop

|Item           | Price     |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Poke Ball*    | $200      |
|*Great Ball*   | $600      |

|*Super Repel*  | $500      |
|*Reverse Candy*| $50       |

Enter the shop on a weekday morning and you'll see Beth and her Miltank.
Talk to her to get a free *Moomoo Milk* sample, then her shop will open.
Note that Berry Juice can be a pretty good hold item at this stage of
the game. It is only open on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday 
Mornings.

Sheridan Village Drinks Shop (1 Badge)

|Item           | Price     |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Berry Juice*  |$100       |

You can sneak around the back of the shop, if you do, talk to the shop
owner from behind to get a *Super Potion!* A tile left and up from the
backdoor on the outside is a hidden *TinyMushroom.*

You'll notice a trucker up from here: this is Truck Guy. He will take us
for free between Sheridan and Gearen, so take advantage of this instead 
of paying the train fee whenever possible.

Head east. Above the boxes is a hidden *Ability Capsule.* Enter the inn.
Note that the Inn will heal your team for a fee right now, but after a
few story events it will become free. Talk to a girl in the lobby to get
a *Sweet Heart.* Talk to a girl in the first room on the left in the
vertical hallway and take on her quest. The woman on the right in the
hall will offer to teach you a few more moves for shards:

Sheridan Village Move Tutor

|Move       | Price         |
|-----------|---------------|
|Worry Seed |2 Red Shards   |
|Uproar     |2 Green Shards |

There is an Audino breeder towards the top: every time you beat them,
you will get 3 *Exp. Candy S.* Once you're ready, we can take care of
some side quests.

At some point, level your Cherubi to Level 25 so that it evolves into
**Cherrim.** On Route 2, in a camper in the far northwest part of the
route, show the guy here your Cherrim for a *Miracle Seed.*

There is a day care in town. Take your Jigglypuff and any other Pokemon
in the Fairy egg group there and breed to get **Igglybuff.** Then, trade
it with a girl in the inn to get a **Smoochum** holding a *Twisted
Spoon!*

Talk to the truck guy and have him take you back to Gearen City. In
Jenner's lab, use the Room ID Card to get the *Exp. Share!* Read the
note, then talk to Melia's wardrobe to get the *Audition Tape.* Plug it
in to the computer to watch a lore cutscene if you want.

Head into the Gearen Lab and go to Jenner's lab. Head to the left and
talk to Professor Hawthorne. He wants a Dex that has seen 100 Pokemon -
this is an easy goal if you haven't been avoiding all the trainers and
optional battles. Grab either the **Elekid** egg or the **Magby** egg
and read Jenner's journal if you want.

Talk to him again, and he'll request a dex with 350 seen. You might not
have this yet but once you do, he'll offer you the other of the Johto
baby eggs.

Return to Sheridan Arena at the top.

Head up and talk to the **Swablu** flying overhead for a battle. Return
to Keta's house and talk to him in his garden.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I am. (Keta +2)  
- But i just got here... (Keta -2)

## Amethyst Grotto and Sheridan Help Quests

After accepting Keta's quest, head all the way out of the village and go
back all the way through Amethyst Cave. In the second room, interact
with this box of plants, then head north. Go to the west side of the
room, where you'll see a man getting assaulted by **Solrock.** Challenge
it to a battle and catch it to proceed.

Continue through the cave. Once at the entrance, head west until you see
a red rock. Touch the stone, and a door will open. Enter and go
downstairs. On the left above a tree is a hidden *Moon Ball*.

Amethyst Grotto

| Grass         | %        |
|---------------|----------|
| **Dunsparce** | 36       |
| Meowth        | 31       |
| Jigglypuff    | 25       |
| **Girafarig** | 8        |

On the right side, two tiles right and three tiles above the rock smash
is a hidden *Red Shard.* A rock smash above hides a *Heart Scale* in the
left side of a red tree. On the left, above the stage thing, in the
middle of a red tree is another *Red Shard.*

Once you're ready, talk to the spirit of Keta. He will give you the
*Soul Stone.* Then exit and watch the scene and fast travel back to
Sheridan.

Returning to the inn in Sheridan you'll be given $8000 for saving the
guy.

Now is a good time to do the Sheridan Village Help Quests. The help
center is in the upper right part of the village.

### HQuest 8: Hidden Library 2

Start outside the help center and talk to the backpacker. Truck to 
Gearen, then go to the Chrisola Hotel and talk to Karen in front.

Head to Dr. Jenkel's lab and watch the scene. Go to Gearen Park and 
talk to Karen. Enter the library. 

Pick up the green book behind the pillar at the entrance. Enter the
main chamber and pick up the blue book. We can encounter Pokemon here,
but there's only 1 type: **Unown!**

Pick up the purple book nearby. To the right there is a 2-tile space
without a bookshelf on the bottom, one tile up from the right one
contains an *Ether.*

Go right for the orange book and up for the red book. Also:

ZCell 009: Hidden Library

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image9.png"
style="width:6.66667in;height:5.04167in" />

Go down. Pick up the lime book, and *TM63 Embargo.*

Head back up and go all the way up, picking up the sky-blue book.

Head up. Next to the door, there are candle things. The second from
the top on the right contains a hidden *Charcoal!*

Follow Karen into the north room. On the left, pick up the golden
book*.* On the right, pick up the lemon book.

Now that we have found nine books, head back to where we saw Elgyem
flying by earlier. Interact with the bookshelf it's on and place the
books inside. A level 1 **Elgyem** will then battle you!

Head back into the upper room and talk to Karen. While she'll get the
Mega Ring, you'll get the *Ancient Book.* This will allow you to read 
Garufan prophecies. Check out the ones on the wall, if you're 
interested.

Head back to Sheridan Village when you're done and talk to the
backpacker.

You can choose to give him the book or not. I recommend giving him
the book since we can get another later, and if you choose to,
you'll get *Blue Moon Ice Cream!*

Claim your reward: $950 and *Water Stone*! (+1 Karma, +1 Karen
Relationship Point)

### HQuest 9: Stolen Cargo!

Use the trucker to get to Gearen City, then go to Oceana Pier. Head to
the southeast, then follow the guy into the warehouse.

If you try to go north, you'll get shocked, and your Pokemon will
faint. The key here is to transform the Factory field into
Short-Circuit via battling the Electrike trainer in the southwest
and getting it to use Discharge. Once you've done this, head through
the middle arrows.

Venam will join you for a battle. Once you've won, she'll leave.

Before we leave the warehouse, interact with the panel to switch the
direction of the middle tile, then head right. Grab *TM09 Venoshock*
then head back to Sheridan.

Claim your reward: $950 and five *GourmetTreats*. (+1 Karma, +1 Venam
Relationship Point)

### HQuest 10: Trade Me!

First, grab one Aipom from your PC. If you didn't get one yet, go to
Route 2 and interact with them. Then go to Sheridan Arena.

Talk to the girl with blue hair, then trade for **Pancham.**

Claim your reward: $1920 and *Rare Candy*! (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 11: Fetch an Item!

Start by heading through Amethyst Cave to Route 2.

Pick up one of the blue item balls. If you have 50000, you're
welcome to pay for the item, but if not, you'll get teleported to
the THIEF'S DUNGEON!

After talking to the grunt and getting out, memorize the map on the
wall. If you don't take the path outlined, you will get destroyed…
Enter the door that corresponds to yellow to get an *Ice Stone,* or
*Dusk Stone* depending on random chance.

Escape, and return to the help center. Talk to the guy to get *Blue
Moon Ice Cream.*

Claim your reward: $1890, Casteliacone! (+1 Karma)

### HQuest 12: Battle Request 2

Prepare your team and talk to Novae at the inn at night.

    -   Pluck
    -   Rock Blast

This is a tough one, two of her party members are already fully evolved
and hit hard. Again, feel free to save this for later if you must.

After the battle, return to the help center. Your rewards: $1600, and
**Clobbopus.** (+1 Karma).

Real quick there's another quest we can do. Take the truck back to
Gearen and enter Karrina's hideout near the sewers. Talk to her, and
she'll send us on the gang fight quest. Head to Route 2 and enter
Amethyst Cave.

Head up, and beat the guy at the end to get **Houndour!**

That's all we can take care of for now, so head back to Sheridan to see
Keta.

## Diamond Punch Badge? - Badge1.5

As soon as you're ready, talk to Aelita on the battlefield

Sensei Keta (Forest Field)

-   Combusken, Level 22. @ Charcoal.
    -   Cut
    -   Gale Strike
    -   Protect
    -   Flame Burst
-   Galarian Farfetch'd, Level 23. @ Eviolite.
    -   Gale Strike
    -   Brutal Swing
    -   Pluck
    -   Quick Attack

    -   Brutal Swing
    -   Gale Strike
    -   Fake Out
    -   Rock Tomb
-   Machoke, Level 23. @ Coba Berry.
    -   Knock Off

    -   Flame Charge

-   Lucario, Level 24. @ Black Belt
    -   Gale Strike
    -   Poison Sweep
    -   Rock Tomb
    -   Bullet Punch

Gale Strike: Fighting \| Physical \| 60 power \| 100% accuracy \|
Guaranteed critical hit if user is under 50% HP \| On Forest Field,
power is boosted x1.5 and deals additional Grass-type damage.

This battle is the first to really show you how well the trainers
compensate for their type disadvantages here -- almost everything has a
Dark or Rock type move. Scraggy is a good dud to leave out, especially
if you can paralyze it -- it doesn't do enough damage to really be
threatening at least compared to his other Pokemon. Combusken can be
tough once it outspeeds you, but also has Protect so it might be smart
to focus your attacks on the other Pokemon. A very tough fight but you
have lots of team options to make it more possible.

Sensei runs off instead of paying up a badge. Follow Aelita into the
waterfall cave.

## Carotos Mountain

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes. (Aelita +1)  
- No. (Aelita -1)

You'll team up with Aelita here, so she'll heal you but catching wild
Pokemon is a bit tougher.

Carotos Mountain

| Cave         | %    | Old Rod    | %    |
|--------------|------|------------|------|
| **Numel**    | 40   | **Numel**  | 70   |
| **Slugma**   | 30   | **Slugma** | 30   |
| **Onix**     | 19   |            |      |
| **Rolycoly** | 9    |            |      |
| **Nosepass** | 2    |            |      |

On the left, past a rock smash, is *TM121 Fire Spin*.

Once you cross the bridge to the right, prepare for battle and talk to
the robotic looking thing. It will challenge you and has a Shadow
**Ponyta!**

Head through the door, pick up a hidden *Full Heal* in the barrel to the
right, and battle the Xen Grunts. The second grunt will have a Shadow
**Vanillite.** The third has a Shadow **Bonsly.** Defeat SEC and his
Flareon, then pick up the *Red Shard* hidden in the barrel to the right.

If you head to the right, grab the *Ultra Ball* in the left side of the
machine as you go. The bottom left of the four barrels contains a
*Reverse Candy*. Down from here, you can grab *TM43 Flame Charge.*
Observe the passwords written all over the walls in this floor. There is
a *Synthetic Seed* as well as a *Fire Stone* if you follow the path to
the right. Right now, this will evolve Pansear.

SEC will require you to input a password to move on. The passwords are,
in order, BEAUTY, IDOL, SHADOW. Talk to it a few more times and it will
challenge you with a Shadow **Quagsire.**

Once you're ready, go up the elevator and head towards Madelis' Palace.
Go inside when you get the chance to, and you'll team up with Keta.

Head into the left room. Grab the *Hyper Potion* on the left and
*Revive* up above. At the top of the room, grab the *Yellow Key.*

Head back out and go into the right room. Talk to Sharon to get the
*Green Key* and grab the *Fresh Water* in the top right. Talk to **Mime
Jr.** in the top right to take it with you.

Go back and enter the top left room. Grab the *Red Key.*

Finally, enter the top right room. Make sure you grab the *Up-Grade,
Dusk Ball* and the *Blue Key.*

Head back out into the foyer and insert each key into the keyholes on
the walls.

Head up, then up again. You'll now have to fight Madelis.

Xen Executive Madelis (No Field)

-   Floette, Level 22.
    -   Magical Leaf
    -   Draining Kiss
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Protect
-   Salandit, Level 22.
    -   Poison Gas
    -   Flame Burst
    -   Venoshock
    -   Fake Out
-   Golbat, Level 24.
    -   Wing Attack
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Double Team
    -   Venoshock
-   Cufant, Level 24.
    -   Iron Head
    -   Stomp
    -   Growl
    -   Rollout
-   Houndoom, Level 25. @ Chople Berry.
    -   Snarl
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Thunder Fang
    -   Crunch
-   Shadow Mewtwo, Level 27.
    -   Energy Ball
    -   Psychic
    -   Miracle Eye
    -   Aura Sphere
    -   Shadow Chill

This one doesn't have to be won, though it is very doable. Winning
grants +1 Karma and +1 Relationship Point with Madelis. This battle
looks rough, but you'll have Keta on your side, so it's functionally a
12 on 6. A rock type can demolish half of her team, and Keta's fast
fighting Pokemon will help you out. Two of them have fake out, so when
you get to Mewtwo, try to take advantage of those turns to deal heavy
damage to Mewtwo. Mewtwo also takes damage every time it attacks thanks
to Fever Pitch, so take advantage of that and dish out as much damage as
you can as soon as her other Pokemon are all wiped out.

Afterwards, head into the door behind Madelis' chair, and go down the
lift.

We haven't had enough legendary battles with only one gym badge quite
yet, so follow Aelita up and grab the *Rift Dex Info.*

After a brief scene, you'll be taken into a rift space. Talk to
Volcanion and answer its question and the battle will begin!

Dimensional Rift Volcanion

-   Volcanion, Level 23. @ Demon Stone. Ability: Water Absorb. Stat
    Spread: 110/60/80/90/200/20. 2 Shields.
    -   Water Pulse
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Bulldoze
    -   Rock Slide

So, you'll probably be faster than this guy. With only 110/80 on the
physical side, it's not too hard to whittle its shields, then its entire
health bar down with some decent STAB moves.

Once you're free, head to the gate in Sheridan, and enter the spring.

Spring of Purification

| Grass        | %    | Old Rod/Good Rod    | %    |
|--------------|------|---------------------|------|
| Bellsprout   | 46   | Goldeen             | 100  |
| Zigzagoon    | 20   |                     |      |
| Illumise     | 10   |                     |      |
| Volbeat      | 10   |                     |      |
| Paras        | 10   |                     |      |
| Oddish       | 4    |                     |      |

Pick up the *Magical Seed* up from the entrance. Head up and talk to the
pair.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Are you ok? (+1 Karma)  
- Who's Vivian? (Neutral)

Once you leave the shrine, Keta will ask you to fast travel to Amethyst
Grotto. If you're ready, feel free. Otherwise, we now have up to 7 new
Pokemon we can use by purifying them! Shadow Pokemon in Rejuvenation
have moves they can't normally get, for example Ponyta has Fell Stinger
and Bonsly has Shift Gear. To purify, keep the shadow Pokemon in your
party and run around, or use the Purify Chamber in the PC.

One more thing we can do: head into the house in the bottom right of
Sheridan. Gothitelle will battle us!

Crescent's Gothitelle (No Field)

-   Gothitelle, Level 32. @ Twisted Spoon.
    -   Psychic
    -   Shock Wave
    -   Calm Mind
    -   Signal Beam

If you win, you'll be able to pick up **Gothita** behind!

Head into Amethyst Grotto ready for the REAL gym fight.

## Diamond Punch Badge

Well, that's about all we can take care of at this point.

Head back to Amethyst Grotto with a fully healed team. The Spirit of Keta 
will be able to give us a badge, so let's challenge him.

Sensei Keta (No Field)

-   Larvesta, Level 22
    -   Flame Charge
    -   Take Down
    -   Bug Bite
    -   Magnet Rise
-   Roselia, Level 22. @ Occa Berry.
    -   Magical Leaf
    -   Hidden Power Water
    -   Venoshock
    -   Leech Seed
-   Ninetales, Level 23. @ Charcoal.
    -   Flame Burst
    -   Will-o-Wisp
    -   Hex
    -   Feint Attack
-   Krokorok, Level 23. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Bite
    -   Bulldoze
    -   Hone Claws
    -   Poison Sweep
-   Lapras, Level 24. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Body Slam
    -   Water Pulse
    -   Freeze Dry
    -   Ice Shard
-   Gallade, Level 25. @ Leftovers.
    -   Low Sweep
    -   Psycho Cut
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Poison Sweep

Compared to Novae, this battle won't be too hard but is still scary.
Gallade hits hard and is fast. In general, you want to try to set up on
one of the weaker Pokemon like Roselia or Larvesta, if you can, it won't
be too awful.

After you win, you'll get the Diamond Fist Badge! This enables you to
cut and puts our level cap at 30. He'll also leave behind *TM103
Stacking Shot.*

Talk to Aelita upstairs and agree to sleep.

# Chapter 3: Tainted Light

## Sewers Visit 2

Eldest will give us *Super Potions.* From Route 2, head into the city.
If you've completed Karrina's Amethyst Cave quest, you'll get +2 Aelita
Relationship Points. Two tiles to the left of the tree to the left of
Venam's house contains a hidden *Repel.*

Make your way to the sewers. Talk to Amanda for a battle.

Trainer Amanda (No Field)

-   Bronzor, Level 24. @ Heat Rock.
    -   Sunny Day
    -   Gyro Ball
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Psywave
-   Weepinbell, Level 25. @ Miracle Seed.
    -   Razor Leaf
    -   Knock Off
    -   Sleep Powder
    -   Hidden Power Fire
-   Miltank, Level 24.
    -   Stomp
    -   Milk Drink
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Stacking Shot
-   Hatenna, Level 25. @ TwistedSpoon.
    -   Psybeam
    -   Draining Kiss
    -   Nuzzle
    -   Aromatherapy
-   Druddigon, Level 26. @ Charcoal.
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Dragon Tail
    -   Sunny Day
    -   Metal Claw

This is a surprisingly tough battle, namely due to Miltank. Once it
paralyzes your Pokemon and starts stomping, it's hard to get off a hit
sometimes. Putting Miltank to sleep long enough to knock it is one way
to win this one. Anyways, after battle, she'll give you *HM01 Cut*!

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'll get it done! (Karrina +2, Aelita +1)  
- ... (Neutral)  
- I'm kinda scared... (Karrina -2)

Enter the sewers and head to the back, cutting along the way.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Hi Lucha. (Venam +1)
- You're Venam's friend? (Venam +2)
- Have we met? (Neutral)

Chrysalis Courtyard (Grassy Terrain)

| Grass               | %        |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Meowth (Alolan)** | 30       |
| **Hoppip**          | 20       |
| **Minun**           | 14       |
| **Plusle**          | 14       |
| **Skiploom**        | 10       |
| Girafarig           | 10       |
| **Porygon**         | 2        |

All of these will also be available to catch later.

After Venam asks you to figure out how to get in, read the inscription
to the right: Password \#3: 8187. Head over to the left side and enter
the left hole in the hedge to get a weird key. Use it on the first gate.
Then go through the hole on the left and open the second gate from
behind. Talk to Venam at the door, then sneak in the window.

Answer the questions as you like. When you regain control, head upstairs
and talk to Marianette to get her to join your party! Talk to her in
every room of the house for background info. Enter Indriad's room by
talking to the maids guarding it.

He'll send you on three trials. Before we do that though, talk to the
maid in the entry room and she'll give you a bonus trial we can do while
completing the others.

Take the downstairs left door to the Hedge Garden. Essentially a
Dusknoir will warp us back if we ever turn around, so make sure you're
always following the red ivy to continue. We can come back without
Dusknoir in a bit to get all the items.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yeah, I am. (Marianette -1)
- It was nothing... (Marianette +2)
- You flatter me... (Marianette +1)
- Say it again. (Marianette -2)

Afterwards you must fight a servant!

Servant Moya (Grassy Terrain)

-   Dusknoir, Level 35. @ Dusknoir Crest. 2 Shields.
    -   Ice Punch
    -   Shadow Punch
    -   Psychic
    -   Brick Break

This can be tough, but Marianette's Pokemon do help out.

Relationship Point Choices:
- It was cool. (Neutral)  
- Calm down. (Marianette -3)  
- You were a great help! (Marianette +3) 

Enter at the top and save Luca.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You're growing. (Marianette +2)
- Yeah, you are. (Marianette -2)
- You can change that! (Marianette +3)

Back in the maze, from the bottom: A path in the southwest leads you to
a *Normal Gem.* A dead-end to the west says Password 1 is 7896. Another
dead end in the bottom right leads you to 2 *Exp. Candy M's!* Two more
towards the middle of the maze give us a *PP Up* and two *Super
Potions*. Another in the northwest corner is an *Elixir.* Towards the
end is a *Sitrus Berry.* You'll also find the first optional maid, Lara,
so defeat her to continue that quest.

Now follow the right path through the mansion. In the dining room, talk
to Marianette, you may randomly get a chance to give her an Oran Berry.
This gives (+7 Marianette) Relationship Points.

Exit to the right. If you hug the left wall and go through a secret
passage, you'll see another inscription. This one says Password 2 is
3135. Head up and beat the second optional maid, Yara, hiding in the
left corner.

At the top, you need to navigate two pieces onto the colored tiles, but
the buttons control both pieces. Carefully use the walls to your
advantage to solve this one. Three times and you're done: save Lenny.

Relationship Point Choices:
- To instill fear. (Marianette +2)  
- Who knows? (Marianette -1)  
- It's a fun hobby! (Marianette -3)

Next, head back out the way we came in through the courtyard. Talk to
the maid in one of the gardens to the south, Deandra, for a battle.

We've now fought all three maids, so return to the one in the main room.
She unlocks all the doors in the mansion! Head through the door on the
left and go up. Inside you'll find a *Full Heal, Reverse Candy, Ability
Capsule,* and *Elixir.* Talk to Marianette while you're in here and ask
about a box to fight a **Bronzor.** Finally, return to the room we woke
up in and go through the upper doors. You can't go through with
Marianette with you, so we'll have to come back when she's not with us
anymore.

Head back into the courtyard and enter the Absol statue.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'll be fine! (Marianette +1)  
- HURRY AND FREE ME! (Marianette -4)  
- It's okay, stay calm (Marianette +4)

The first two rooms are not too hard, grab the *Max Repel* while you're
at it. In the final room, you just must push the colored statues onto
the respective tile without getting caught by Tangrowth, then guide
Tangrowth to its own tile.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You did well. (Marianette +4)
- You cut it kinda close... (Marianette -2)

If you have at least five points with Marianette up till now, you'll get
the following dialogue choice:

Relationship Point Choices:
- It's okay Marianette. (Marianette +8)  
- I don't know... (Marianette -12)

Now that Marianette is no longer following us, we can go through the
path in our room again. Enter the three passwords (7896, 3135, 8187) in
the machine, then head through the frozen prison to speak with Anju.

To get an item, tell her the truth here, though this item doesn't do
anything unique for us yet. To do so, tell her the world is safe,
Sheridan is safe, but Hiyoshi is destroyed. If you do answer truthfully,
she will give you *Anju's Pendant!*

## Normality Badge

Exit and return to the mansion. Before we proceed, exit all the way out
to Gearen to pick up what Aelita dropped: *3 Super Potions, 4 Exp. Candy
M, 2 Exp. Candy S, 2 Chesto Berries,* a *Cheri Berry,* and *Protective
Pads.* Back in the mansion, in the main doors, there is an Audino
breeder, and each time you win, you'll get 5 *Exp. Candy S*.

As soon as you're ready, follow the path up from here.

Overall, what is said in the gym guide is good advice. The first thing
you must be cautious of is Delcatty, who likes to Baton Pass +2 in both
defenses to Chatot or Drampa, who can then boost and go on a rampage. A
move like Roar is a good counter for that. Otherwise, a decently rounded
team should be able to deal with most of the Pokemon here - four are
dual types with varied weaknesses.

Once you win, you'll be awarded with the Normality Badge! Our new level
cap is now 35. Enjoy the following cutscene.

# Chapter 4: Isolation

## 3 Badge Quests

Start at East Gearen. Return to the sewers where the mansion was, then
head to up to grab *TM42 Facade*! Head outside.

Go talk to Shana in the Gearen Lab to continue the Johto quest. You'll
now have to fight Bugsy with the starter you picked and a few more
Pokemon.

Gym Leader Bugsy (Glitch Field)

-   Ariados, Level 14.
    -   Night Shade
    -   Poison Sting
    -   Constrict
-   Ledian, Level 14.
    -   Knock Off
    -   Psybeam
    -   Comet Punch
-   Scyther, Level 15.
    -   Quick Attack
    -   Wing Attack
    -   Pursuit
    -   Fury Cutter

A couple Flame Wheels from Quilava plus a Rock Tomb from Onix made this
one simple on the Cyndaquil path. After this, you'll get another
*Virtual Badge*! This will finish her leg of this quest.

The Poke Ball shop in Gearen has two new balls now, which can be useful
for low catch rate water types like Basculin.

Poke Ball Emporium Shop New Items (3 Badges)

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|*Nest Ball*|$1000     |
|*Net Ball* |$1000     |

There's also a few new berries now.

Berry Emporium Shop New Items (3 Badges)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Rawst Berry*  |$300       |
|*Chesto Berry* |$300       |
|*Aspear Berry* |$300       |

There are a few areas we can now access with Cut. Head back out into
Sheridan Village and cut the tree next to the shop and pick up *TM54
False Swipe*. This can be extremely helpful for catching Pokemon going
forward.

We can also get more drinks!

Sheridan Village Drinks Shop New Items (3+ Badges)

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Lemonade*     |$350       |
|*Moomoo Milk*  |$500       |

Head back down into Amethyst Cave and make your way to the first room
from Route 2. On the northwest side, there are some rock smash boulders
blocking your path. Smash them and emerge in Pom-Pom Meadow. Cut the
trees down here to get access.

You can find infinite *Yellow Nectar* in the pots, and *TM133 Mud Shot*
at the top.

Pom-Pom Meadow

| Grass                  | %        |
|------------------------|----------|
| **Oricorio (Pom-Pom)** | 40       |
| **Yungoos**            | 30       |
| **Cutiefly**           | 12       |
| Butterfree             | 9        |
| Dustox                 | 9        |

## Route 3 and Phasial Cave

As soon as you're ready, head to Route 3, west from Sheridan.

Route 3 Gate Shop

|Item       |Price      |
|-----------|-----------|
|*Poke Ball*|$200       |
|*Potion*   |$300       |
|*Repel*    |$350       |

The top tile to the right of the river contains a *Honey,* and to the
left of the RV is a *Quiet Mint.*

Talk to the guy in the trailer across the bridge. Since we have two
virtual badges, he'll offer the third leg of the quest -- we're battling
Whitney.

Gym Leader Whitney (Glitch Field)

-   Clefairy, Level 19.
    -   Doubleslap
    -   Metronome
    -   Softboiled
-   Jigglypuff, Level 20.
    -   Headbutt
    -   Sing
    -   Thunderpunch
    -   Attract
-   Miltank, Level 21.
    -   Milk Drink
    -   Stomp
    -   Rollout
    -   Attract

I had Quilava, Onix, and Qwilfish, so I took advantage of Clefairy to
have Qwilfish set up Toxic Spikes, letting Onix easily wall Miltank and
Jigglypuff. After winning, you'll get the third *Virtual Badge.*

That's not all, he'll then offer you the next challenge, this time
against Morty.

Gym Leader Morty (Glitch Field)

-   Misdreavus, Level 22.
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Mean Look
    -   Protect
    -   Perish Song
-   Haunter, Level 24. @ Chesto Berry.
    -   Curse
    -   Night Shade
    -   Rest
    -   Mean Look
-   Mismagius, Level 24.
    -   Me First
    -   Night Shade
    -   Will-O-Wisp
    -   Charge Beam
-   Gengar, Level 25. @ Wide Lens.
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Dream Eater
    -   Ice Punch
    -   Night Shade

This battle sharply increases the difficulty for the Cyndaquil route! I
ended up relying on RNG to win to some extent. Essentially, use Eevee
and Onix to take out Misdreavus and Haunter, switching to avoid Perish
Song and Curse damage. Mismagius can be taken down with Eevee, Onix,
Qwilfish working together, then save Quilava for Gengar, where you must
use Smokescreen and pray all his Hypnosis and Ice Punch miss long enough
for you to finally take it down. I recommend attacking first with
Thunderpunch so that gets disabled by Cursed Body instead of Fire Punch.
If you succeed, grab your fourth *Virtual Badge.* That's all we can do
with him for now.

The girl here is the Move Deleter, should you need to remove any moves.

Route 3 North

| Grass        | %        | Old Rod        | %        |
|--------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Yamper**   | 35       | **Wooper**     | 100      |

| **Boltund**  | 1        |                |          |

You can also interact with **Surskit** dancing on the pond surface.

The leftmost cut tree hides a *Sitrus Berry* behind.

On the other side, head down and to the right until you come upon a
market. All the events and shops here can only be accessed during
daytime. Talk to Aelita during the day.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'm starving... (Aelita +2)  
- No distractions! (Neutral)

If you go with the first option, you'll get *Vanilla, Chocolate,* or
*Strawberry Ice Cream*.

Route 3 Left Vendor Shop

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Reverse Candy*|$50        |
|*Sachet*       |$1000      |
|*Soda Pop*     |$300       |
|*Sweet Heart*  |$100       |
|*Red Nectar*   |$550       |
|*Whipped Dream*|$1000      |

We'll eventually need Sachet and Whipped Dream to evolve Swirlix and
Spritzee from earlier. We're also eventually (like, 3 or 4 more badges,
but still) going to want 10 Sweet Hearts for a quest, so go ahead and
get those.

Route 3 Upper Right Vendor Shop

|Item                |Price|
|--------------------|-----|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream* |$400 |
|*Choc Ice Cream*    |$600 |
|*Berry Ice Cream*   |$800 |

She'll also rarely have *Blue Moon Ice Cream* to sell. Ideally, we want
to get a few of each for a side quest later.

The flower above this vendor contains a hidden *Green Shard.* Down and
to the left is *TM117 Pay Day!* This move, in conjunction with Pickup,
is the most effective way to farm money in this game. Hidden behind it
is a *Star Piece.*

Head down from the shops. Just before the grass turns lighter, in the
right gap in the tall grass, there is a hidden *Sassy Mint.* Follow the
path around to the right. Heading back into the darker grass, two tiles
up from the lighter grass on the left is a hidden *Blue Shard.* Head up.
Behind the tree below the RV is a hidden *Rare Candy,* to the left one
tile of the center of the tree. Enter the open RV and talk to the hiker
for some *Rose Tea.*

Route 3 South

| Grass        | %        | Old Rod        | %        |
|--------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Nickit**   | 35       | Wooper         | 100      |

| **Thievul**  | 4        |                |          |
| Zangoose     | 1        |                |          |

Head down till the grass changes color twice. In the tall grass all the
way right is a hidden *Super Repel.* Down from here the grass will
change again, the grass patch four right and two down from the trainer
contains a *Red Shard.* Up the stairs to the left of the waterfall is a
*Mystic Water!* Down from the stairs, the last red flower before the
color changes again hides a *Super Potion.* Crossing the bridge here,
two tiles down from the left of a pair of two tall grass tiles hides a
*Honey.*

We're going to explore the cave on the other side of the route now, so
add a Pokemon to your party with Flash. If you don't have it yet, it's
at the Game Corner in East Gearen.

Head up to the top of Route 3 and go to the left and into Phasial Cave.

Phasial Cave Main Areas (Cave Field)

| Cave          | %        |
|---------------|----------|
| Wooper        | 36       |
| **Chewtle**   | 24       |
| Meowth        | 20       |
| **Silicobra** | 10       |
| **Bibarel**   | 9        |
| **Venipede**  | 1        |

Old Rod encounters are the same as outside.

Downstairs, the rock at the top contains a *Rock Gem.* To the left,
above the pond, in the 2 tile alcove at the top, the right contains a
*Magical Seed.* Pick up the *Ability Capsule* on the ground to the left.
Defeating the trainer down from here, head down and right. A rock at the
bottom will contain a *Steel Gem.* Up, left, down and, left, there is
another pond. The rock at the top right has a *Reverse Candy.* Head to
the left when you can: going left and up you'll find a *Mineral Ball*
hidden in the top pillar. Head back to the right. There is a shining
object on the ground in the middle with the pillars: it is the *Ancient
Wing.* The pillar to the left of this has a hidden *Green Shard* in the
top left. There's a *Blue Shard* to the right. Hug this wall on the
right and go down until you see a small rock, in it is a hidden *Sun
Stone.* A small pillar further down on this wall contains a *Red Shard.*
Head up the ladder here, the rock on the right contains a *Grass Gem.*
Exit to the south!

Attempt to enter Goldenleaf Town to the south. Then, interact with the
tent near the campfire to the north.

Relationship Point Choices:
- A Gym Battle! (Ren +1)  
- Wanna see the sights\~ (Ren +1)  
- No reason... (Ren -2)

When you're ready talk to Aelita for a battle.

Student Aelita (Forest Field)

-   Gligar, Level 28.
    -   Aerial Ace
    -   Bulldoze
    -   Steel Wing
    -   U-Turn
-   Staravia, Level 29.
    -   Aerial Ace
    -   Take Down
    -   Steel Wing
    -   U-Turn
-   Hawlucha, Level 31. @ Flying Gem.
    -   Brick Break
    -   Gale Strike
    -   Bounce
    -   Hone Claws
-   Clobbopus, Level 30. @ Sitrus Berry
    -   Sitrus Berry
    -   Poison Sweep
    -   Brick Break
    -   Power Up Punch
-   Combusken, Level 31. @ Charcoal.
    -   Blaze Kick
    -   Bulk Up
    -   Thunderpunch
    -   Night Slash

This isn't going to be that tough of a battle - her team is mostly not
fully evolved and doesn't yet take advantage of the full power STAB
moves. Hawlucha can be dangerous if it gets off a couple Hone Claws --
make sure your best Pokemon to take it out isn't surprised by Flying Gem
boosted Bounce. Electric, Psychic, and Flying types will overall succeed
here if you're stuck.

Enter Goldenleaf town at the bottom!

If you beat the garden guardian at the bottom of town, he'll let you
into his garden. Check the middle normal grass tile, and right fence
post on the bottom, for a *Moon Stone* and *Rare Candy* respectively.
Pick up the *Rash Mint* too.

The pumpkin to the left of the entrance to the town contains a *Honey.*
The red flower to the south of Ren's house contains a *Ghost Gem,* and
to the left side of the house here one tile south of the red flower is a
hidden *Dark Gem.* North of the Pokemon Center is a pumpkin, one tile
above is a *Red Shard.* To the left is some tables - the bottom left has
a *Super Potion* on it, the top right has an *Ability Capsule.* Cutting
a tree to the left leads us to a hidden *Big Mushroom.* Finally, on the
top hill of the town the rightmost blank space contains a *Rawst Berry.*

The tall grass straight left from here contains a *Chesto Berry.*

Enter the Forgotten Path to the northeast. Two tiles left and two up
from the sign is a hidden *Green Shard.* A blank tile on the left side

top right tile. Above from here the three out of four splotchy tiles
right before the stairs contain *Burn Heal, Great Ball, Ghost Gem.*

This is all we can do here for now, so head back to Goldenleaf Town.

Head into Wispy Park up the stairs at the bottom left. To the left of
the tree immediately to the left and up a tile is a *TinyMushroom.* On
the other side, one tile below the corner in the road is a *Lemonade.*
Grab the *Reverse Candy* on the right.

Talk to the guy up here, then to **Espurr**. It will let you do a
variety of fun things with it; each increases your friendship with it.
Choosing to give it ice cream, especially Blue Moon Ice Cream, raises it
by a lot. Once you've gotten its friendship high enough and try to leave
it will join your party. (+1 Karma)

Head down the stairs and around to the right. In the top right of the
park, you'll see a little pumpkin up above - two tiles up and one right
is a hidden *Ghost Gem.* Head to the left, you'll see a big pumpkin on
the ground. One tile left, and two right and two up, you'll find a
*Careful Mint* and a *Rawst Berry.* The right tile of the green tree
below contains a *Green Shard.* Down from here, the empty spot on the
right with a tall grass in all four directions contains an *Ability
Capsule.* The tiny tree below contains a *Hyper Potion.*

Head into the gatehouse on the left side and you'll be recruited by “C”
to take care of the Dimensional Rift, but only after a 3v3 battle with
his three bug types.

International Police “C”

-   Orbeetle, Level 30.
    -   Signal Beam
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Psybeam
    -   Confuse Ray
-   Ariados, Level 31. @ Poison Barb.
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Bug Bite
    -   Poison Sweep
    -   Swords Dance
-   Galvantula, Level 32. @ Magnet.
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Hidden Power Grass
    -   Charge Beam
    -   Signal Beam

Orbeetle can be annoying if it puts you to sleep, so have a way to
account for that. Ariados isn't hard to take down but make sure you
don't let Galvantula sweep after a Charge Beam or two. Fire types will
do well here!

First thing we're going to do is head into Goldenwood Cave. We couldn't
get here with Rock Smash before, but now that we can, go ahead and pick
up the *Rare Candy* and *Nugget*! Your Pokemon should be able to now
beat the Leavanny trainer, if you haven't yet.

Outside the cave, head right as soon as you can. Two tile directly below
the first tree is a *Chesto Berry.* Down the stairs, the top left tile
by the river is a *Nest Ball.* Four tiles right and six down from the
sign is a hidden *Ether.* Across the bridge two tiles up and two tiles
left from the first blue mushrooms you see is a *PP Up.* The middle tile
in the bottom on the left by the water is a *GourmetTreat*. Heading
right, there's a grove in the top right: below the skinny tree is a
hidden *Great Ball.* Down from here there are two sets of red mushrooms:
above the second is a *Reverse Candy.* In the former garden below the
second accessible tile from the right on top has an *Oran Berry.* To the
left and up from here, a tile above the leftmost red mushrooms before
the stairs contains a *Persim Berry.* Go up the first stairs then left.
Two tiles right of the leftmost red flower is a *Sitrus Berry.* Pick up
the *Guard Spec.* below.

Head up to where you fought Zetta. Once you're ready, interact with the
dimensional rift to engage Gyarados.

Dimensional Rift Gyarados (Forest Field)

-   Rift Gyarados, Level 40. Type: Water/Ghost. Stat Spread:
    70/110/100/90/78/100. 2 Shields.
    -   Waterfall
    -   Crunch
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Phantom Force

If it is too hard now, you can come back any time before the fifth gym.
Take it out, and C will thank us. (+1 Karma)

## Wispy Tower

As soon as that's over, enter Wispy Tower from the top of Wispy Path. On
the right, below the middle of five trees in the middle of the street is
a hidden *Bold Mint.* Head in.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I accept! (Aelita +2, Narcissa +4)
- I dunno... (Aelita -1, Narcissa -2)

Once that's done, head back into the Pokemon Center and talk to Aelita.

Relationship Point Choices:
- It was nothing.. (Ren +2, Aelita +2)
- Kinda uncomfortable. (Ren +1, Aelita +1)
- Uhh what's happening? (Neutral)

After a scene you'll be taken into a battle. Head upstairs to talk to
Aelita and sleep, then defeat the three Xen grunts downstairs disguised
as Ghost types. Upstairs, head into the room at the top. When you regain
control, beat the trainer.

Relationship Point Choices:
- How'd you know? (Neutral)
- I want to go home. (Mosely -2)
- Time to whoop ass! (Neutral)

We're going back to Wispy Tower. Enter Wispy Tower and go through the
newly revealed path. After talking to Geara, Mosely and Narcissa will
join you.

Forsaken Laboratory

| Grass                | %        |
|----------------------|----------|
| Dunsparce            | 40       |
| **Diglett (Alolan)** | 30       |
| **Graveler**         | 11       |
| Geodude              | 10       |
| **Dugtrio**          | 9        |

Note that the grunts here have some Shadow Pokemon, but we can't catch
them with a broken snag machine. Sad.

Enter the left room to get a *Revive.* The room next door will give us a
password, UNBOUND, to enter on the right side of the area. Do so and
enter the room, battling the guy and getting the next password: SOUL. To
the right is an *Ether*, then enter the password and continue. Talk to
the screen in here.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Gregory? (Neutral)
- Sirius hid this. (Neutral)
- You seriously didnt know? (Mosely -2, Narcissa -2)

Interact with the screen and choose one of the two top answers to not
lose relationship points. Back in the main room, head up for a battle.

Team Xen Eli and Sharon (Short Circuit Field)

-   Tangela, Level 31. @ Eviolite.
    -   Giga Drain
    -   Stun Spore
    -   Ancient Power
    -   Knock Off
-   Lickitung, Level 31. @ Leftovers.
    -   Icy Wind
    -   Body Slam
    -   Rock Tomb
    -   Knock Off
-   Honchkrow, Level 32. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Feint Attack
    -   Swagger
    -   Drill Peck
    -   Thunder Wave
-   Mismagius, Level 32. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Mystical Fire
    -   Hex
    -   Magical Leaf
    -   Psywave

It's been a while since we've had to fight this pair, but it's luckily
not too much worse this time. Their main strategy here relies on moves
that slow down your Pokemon, by stat-lower and paralysis. Tangela and
Lickitung are slightly bulky, so bring out your own bulky party members
to bring them down and save your faster Pokemon for Honchkrow and
Mismagius and you'll likely be alright.

After the fight, make sure you heal, then return and go downstairs and
through the door. Go up and you'll fight Geara!

Xen Executive Geara (Short Circuit Field)

-   Giratina, Level 37. @ Griseous Orb.
    -   Shadow Claw
    -   Dragon Breath
    -   Slash
    -   Thunderbolt

This is a tough fight. You're gonna need to break the barriers, but
luckily your own Ghost and Dark moves are boosted by the field, so that
should help. Burning it and lowering its special attack may be the key
to victory since it is fast enough to take out your Pokemon quickly. You
can also whittle its HP down by burning/poisoning/leech seeding it and
anticipating what move it will use and switching to a
Normal/Ground/Fairy type.

Xen Executive Geara (Short Circuit Field)

-   Persian, Level 33. @ Normal Gem.
    -   Dig
    -   Covet
    -   Aerial Ace
    -   Seed Bomb
-   Marowak (Alolan), Level 34. @ Thick Club.
    -   Bonemerang
    -   Shadow Bone
    -   Fire Punch
    -   Will-o-Wisp
-   Masquerain, Level 33. @ Charti Berry.
    -   Struggle Bug
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Bubblebeam
    -   Air Slash
-   Morgrem, Level 34. @ Light Clay.
    -   Light Screen
    -   Reflect
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Foul Play
-   Haunter, Level 35. @ Eviolite.
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Will-o-Wisp
    -   Sludge Bomb
-   Clefairy, Level 35. @ Eviolite.
    -   Follow Me
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Icy Wind
    -   Dazzling Gleam

This is a well put together doubles team. Persian will probably hit
first and Marowak will probably hit last and probably knock one of your
mons out, so plan your turn 1 attacks accordingly. Morgrem and Clefairy
are very effective at stalling, but you can try to time knocking them
out so that the screens run out. Haunter and Masquerain hit hard but if
you have set up any of your Pokemon you may be able to succeed!

When you're back in town, you can proceed to the gym immediately, or go
tackle a side area real fast.

## Mirage Woods

Head back to the top of Route 3 and enter the clearing on the left. Cut
down the trees.

Mirage Woods  

| Grass        | %        |
|--------------|----------|
| **Kecleon**  | 36       |
| Spritzee     | 30       |
| **Stantler** | 24       |
| Doduo        | 9        |
| Zangoose     | 1        |

Put the wing we found into the statue.

Ancient Kingdra (Forest Field)

-   Kingdra, Level 38. 2 Shields.
    -   Rain Dance
    -   Snipe Shot
    -   Thunder
    -   Dragon Pulse

This might be a tough one! If you have some way to lower its special
attack do it, though note that Snipe Shot will often crit. Luckily its
first turn and every turn that rain ends it will probably use Rain
Dance, so that's your chance to mess with it via paralysis or stat
drops. It doesn't have any way to heal.

Once you succeed, head north across the bridge. Grab the *Telluric Seed*
to the right.

If you enter the left house, there's a *Steam Ball* on the ground. Talk
to the scientist in the top right, then he'll let you into the other
buildings. The bottom right building contains an *Itemfinder!* Helpful
to find hidden items. Feel free to use it to find any of the previous
hidden items if you haven't obtained them yet.

Start using it around the woods. In total, you'll find: A *Clever Wing,
Repel, Black Flute, Genius Wing, Green Shard, Ether, Zinc, Pretty Wing,*
and *Moomoo Milk.*

If you haven't yet gotten Flash from the Casino, we'll need it for the
next quest. Once you have Flash taught to a Pokemon, enter the upper
right house.

ZCell 013: Mirage Cave

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image13.png"
style="width:6.64583in;height:4.97917in" />

Grab the cell and *TM66 Payback*.

Head up and agree to use Flash, and a battle will ensue.

Pokegang Crobat (Cave Field)

-   Zubat, Level 33.
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Swift
    -   Air Cutter
    -   Acrobatics
-   Zubat, Level 33.
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Swift
    -   Air Cutter
    -   Acrobatics
-   Zubat, Level 33.
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Swift
    -   Air Cutter
    -   Acrobatics
-   Zubat, Level 33.
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Swift
    -   Air Cutter
    -   Acrobatics
-   Crobat, Level 48.
    -   Acrobatics
    -   Toxic
    -   Poison Fang
    -   Confuse Ray

A good Rock or Steel type with high defense can effectively wall this
battle. If you manage to win, you'll get a **Zubat** afterwards!

Once you're ready, exit to Sheridan village. There's one more side quest
we can do here. On the south side of town, you'll see a Sawk and Throh
standing by a woman. After a scene and a fight with a trainer, you'll
have a chance to catch **Throh!**

Talk to the trucker to head back to Gearen City - we're going to make a
pitstop with Zumi. For catching Drifloon, she'll give us 3 *Exp. Candy
M*. Talk to the blue haired girl, then pay to enter the main part of the
library. In the room on the left, talk to the girl in here to do a quiz.
If you answer all the questions correctly, you'll get a *Thunderstone!*
The answers are brown, Goldenwood, and Goldenleaf.

## Phantasm Badge

After you've left Narcissa's house, talk to the Audino breeder next to
the Pokemon Center for a repeatable battle against 3 Audino. Each time
you win, you'll get *5* *Exp. Candy S*.

Enter the theater and talk to Narcissa

Relationship Point Choices:
- This will work. (Ren +2)
- I'm unsure... (Ren +1)
- It's a stupid idea. (Ren -2)

After learning of your challenge, enter the door on the left.

Backstage Theater

| Walking        | %        |
|----------------|----------|
| Shuppet        | 30       |
| Rattata        | 20       |
| **Raticate**   | 20       |
| **Duskull**    | 14       |
| **Banette**    | 10       |
| **Yamask**     | 6        |

Yamask and Duskull might be helpful for our upcoming gym battle.

Enter the door on the left, then talk to Mimikyu and read the sign. As
the NPC says outside, follow the lit torches through the dungeon.
Although it may feel like you're going in circles, just keep following
the torches until you finally pass through a mirror and get to the heal
and PC stars. Head through the door.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Go ahead, Ren. (Ren +4)  
- No. (Ren -4)

Pokemon Trainer Ren

-   Sableye, Level 33. @ Leftovers.
    -   Recover
    -   Confuse Ray
    -   Night Shade
    -   Secret Power
-   Vibrava, Level 33. @ Earth Plate.
    -   Ominous Wind
    -   Dragon Pulse
    -   Earthquake
    -   Rock Slide
-   Arcanine, Level 35. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Howl
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Hidden Power Ghost
    -   Thunder Fang
-   Cacturne, Level 34. @ Occa Berry.
    -   Needle Arm
    -   Secret Power
    -   Leech Seed
    -   Spiky Shield
-   Frogadier, Level 35. @ Mystic Water.
    -   Icy Wind
    -   Secret Power
    -   Water Pledge
    -   Hidden Power Ghost
-   Corviknight, Level 35. @ Occa Berry.
    -   Spite
    -   Roost
    -   Steel Wing
    -   Drill Peck

This is an easy battle to be honest. Flash and Dazzling Gleam
temporarily nullify the field if you don't want to be overwhelmed by his
Ghost and Dark moves. Once you're done with Ren, say no to his question
for maximum relationship points, then head up and get ready to face
Narcissa.

In the auditorium, head down and grab the items: *Super Potion, Rawst
Berry,* and *Rare Candy.* When you're ready, take on Narcissa.

Leader Narcissa (Haunted Field over Forest Field)

-   Drifblim, Level 33. @ Magical Seed.
    -   Spectral Scream
    -   Hypnosis
    -   Hidden Power Fighting
    -   Icy Wind
-   Mimikyu, Level 33. @ Ghost Gem.
    -   Shadow Claw
    -   Copycat
    -   Play Rough
    -   Shadow Sneak
-   Polteageist, Level 33. @ Colbur Berry.
    -   Will-o-Wisp
    -   Spectral Scream
    -   Mega Drain
    -   Psyshock
-   Aevian Mismagius, Level 35. @ Spooky Plate.
    -   Hone Claws
    -   Shadow Sneak
    -   Shadow Claw
    -   Seed Bomb
-   Chandelure, Level 34.
    -   Will-o-Wisp
    -   Fire Spin
    -   Spectral Scream
    -   Hidden Power Grass
-   Dusclops, Level 35. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Night Shade
    -   Will-o-Wisp
    -   Spectral Scream
    -   Pain Split

Spectral Scream: Ghost \| Special \| 65 power \| 100% accuracy \| 60%
chance to raise user's Defense by 1 stage \| On Haunted Field, power is
boosted x1.5 \| Turns Blessed Field into Haunted Field.

As you can see, Narcissa's team is very tanky and will not hesitate to
burn and sleep you to death, so make sure you have counters for these
things in place. Her Mismagius is fast and with the field hits like a
truck, so you must find a way to live a hit. Flame Charge is boosted by
the field and given Ghost sub-typing, so if you use that move it may
allow you to sweep. Alternatively, if you have Flash, use it! It'll
remove the field for two turns. Just be aware she can turn it back by
using Spectral Scream.

Once you're done, you'll get the Phantasm Badge and *TM30 Shadow Ball!*
Now we can level up to 40.

Head into Wispy Ruins.

# Chapter 5: Imprisoned

## Wispy Ruins

And head back out. Now that the people of Goldenleaf have decided to
change their ways, they'll give us some stuff if we talk to them around
town: a *Super Potion,* a *Revive,* a *Full Heal*, and some *Dusk
Balls!*

Enter the house near the garden and talk to **Snubbull!** The person
will let you have it now that we have 4 badges. Enter the bit of Wispy
Ruins by cutting the tree next to the gym. Step on the tile, then enter
the newly opened 4-badge gate door. Inside the chest is a *Big Nugget*!
Head into the graveyard at the west of town at night with a
GourmetTreat, and you'll find a **Misdreavus!**

Now, head back into Wispy Ruins. Enter the stairs and watch the scene,
then go up in the cave. After going up again, a couple of Shuppet will
drop you into a pit.

Wispy Chasm

| Cave                 | %        |
|----------------------|----------|
| Golett               | 40       |
| Zigzagoon (Galarian) | 24       |
| Graveler             | 15       |
| Yamask               | 14       |
| Baltoy               | 5        |
| Linoone (Galarian)   | 1        |
| **Claydol**          | 1        |

Our goal here is to trap all the Shuppet into corners. There's one in
the southwest - after it moves for the first time, go down, left, down,
up, right, right. Now go up to the west middle area where you'll see
another. Once it moves for the first time, go down, left, down, then
right until you can't anymore, then up. Also, grab this *Max Repel*
while you're here.

Head down from here, hidden is a *Yellow Shard.* You'll see a
**Phantump** wandering around. It is vital for an event later that you
get a female one here, so reset if it's not. Head all the way north
afterwards, and past another Phantump, enter the 2-badge gate. In here,
you'll get a *Dawn Stone!*

Loop back around to the middle, around where the NPC is with the crazy
hair. Head up and to the right and grab the *Cleanse Ta*g, then follow
Shuppet down and up into the middle. Get it to go back through the big
loop counterclockwise, then follow it. It should now be on the upper
path, so follow it right and get it to crawl into the small path in the
middle, then talk to it.

Go up through the center and head left to grab the *Calcium.* Head up
and chase the last Shuppet. For this one, get it to the platform in the
upper left, then to the platform to the right, and down. Talk to it,
then return to the middle of the north side and the Shuppet will let you
pass. Before climbing the ladder, go up and enter the 1-badge gate to
get a *Dusk Stone*! Head up and through the ladder.

ZCell 014: Wispy Ruins

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image14.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:4.97917in" />

Head to the right. I recommend healing sometime soon, there'll be a few
battles upcoming. Once you're done, return, then go up. Follow the path
until you reach a larger room. Hop your way past all the rocks on the
right, then you'll enter a double battle against some Wild Pokemon. This
is an easy fight if you have strong and fast Pokemon.

Proceed to Route 4!

## Route 4

Welcome to Route 4, a sprawling nature preserve. All over there are
items scattered about, and they refresh once a day. Different items will
be present each day.

Route 4 Entrance Area

| Grass: Morning  | %  | Grass: Day     | %  | Grass: Night   | %    |

| Linoone         | 1  | Minun          | 1  |                |      |

There are also Kricketot and Misdreavus in the areas to the north of
where we start at certain times of day.

Talk to Aelita and Nim at the bridge to the south. Cross the bridge to
the north, and Nim will join your party.

Route 4 Central Area

| Grass: Morning   | %   | Grass: Day  | %   | Grass: Night | %   |
|------------------|-----|-------------|-----|--------------|-----|
| Sunflora         | 24  | Bounsweet   | 44  | Bounsweet    | 40  |
| Sunkern          | 20  | Sunflora    | 20  | Meowth       | 35  |

| **Nuzleaf**      | 1   | Minun       | 1   |              |     |

You'll also notice that there are Pidove, Hoothoot, Cubone, as well as
**Flabebe** and **Emolga** in this area!

Interact with the stone den to the right of the bridge for a scene and
to get 5 *Rift Fragments.* These will allow us to catch Shadow Pokemon
from within the dens, when we weaken them to 25% HP. They have shields
like the rifts we've fought so far! Not fighting or defeating it gives
250/500 for common/rare dens respectively, while catching gives 500/1000
respectively.

RIFT DEN 1 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
Graveler, Nuzleaf, **Solosis**, and **Tropius**. The rare ones are
Bonsly, Meowth, and Finneon.

Head back to the left and let Cairo break the rock. You'll get a *Moomoo
Milk.* Head up.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You okay, Nim? (Aelita +1)  
- You're acting weird... (Neutral)

RIFT DEN 2 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are
Tranquill, **Wailmer**, Dunsparce, and **Vullaby**. The rare ones are
**Chatot**, Snorunt, and Cacnea.

To the right of here, at night, you'll find roaming **Wooloo.** To the
right under the bridge, you'll find that *TM45 Attract* is at the
bottom.

Enter Cairo's house. He has a shop set up.

Cairo's Shop (\<8 Badges)

|Item               |Price             |
|-------------------|------------------|
|*Joy Scent (10)*   |$5000             |
|*Excite Scent (10)*|$8500             |
|*Vivid Scent (10)* |$11000            |
|*Bike Voucher*     |250 Red Essences  |
|*Noctowl Crest*    |2000 Red Essences|
|*Phione Crest*     |2000 Red Essences|
|*Fragments (5)*    |$4956             |
|*Fragments (10)*   |$14868            |
|*Fragments (25)*   |$24780            |

Crests are unique held items that give the species in question unique
strengths to make them better. As you can tell from the two on display,
they're generally given to Pokemon that are otherwise bad. The bottom of
this file has details on what every crest does!

Get the Bike Voucher for now if you want, but otherwise start saving up
Rift Essence. If you accumulate *exactly* 10000, talk to **Chespin**
and Cairo will let you have it! You can check with the Gather Cube the
exact amount you have.

Head up. There are Duskull roaming here at night. Try to head into Akuwa
Town to the north for a battle with Nim.

Apprentice Nim (Psychic Terrain)

-   Stonjourner, Level 37. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Stealth Rock
    -   Heavy Slam
    -   Body Press
-   Darmanitan, Level 37. @ Kee Berry.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Psychic
    -   Flamethrower

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Psychic
-   Solrock, Level 38. @ Assault Vest.
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Zen Headbutt
    -   Stone Edge
-   Malamar, Level 37. @ Twisted Spoon.
    -   Psycho Cut
    -   Night Slash
    -   Aerial Ace
    -   Rock Slide
-   Duosion, Level 37. @ Eviolite.
    -   Psychic
    -   Thunder Wave
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Energy Ball

Our second encounter with Nim sees her Pokemon with much stronger
Pokemon with stronger Psychic attacks, but they're still no match for a
decent team. Good dark types and Pokemon that resist Psychic and/or Rock
will do well here. Most of her Pokemon are slow and she doesn't have any
speed control, so if you can outspeed and cripple one or both of her
Pokemon per turn you'll likely find a way through this one.

Enter Akuwa Town and go with Aelita to the old man. We will explore
Akuwa Town in a bit, but there are some quests we can do! Skip the
following section to proceed through the story.

## Lost Camp Part 1, and Floria Side Quests

Head to the left, and sneak through the gap in the fence. Enter Lost
Camp and talk to Maman. She'll quest us with finding kids to populate
the camp, and if you talk to her again a few times, to upgrade the land.
The land upgrades total $2500 for the first wave, so do this if you have
the money.

She won't upgrade further until we've found four children - so let's go
ahead and start finding them. They're located all over the world map, so
we'll be taking a brief tour to get them all. A truck driver in Akuwa
Town can take us to the previous towns. Five *lost kids* are reachable
for now:

1.  Andrew can be found in Abandoned Sewers underneath Gearen City by
    crossing the first bridge north, then the first bridge west, then
    the first bridge down in an alcove at the bottom.

2.  James can be found by entering Spring of Purification from Sheridan
    Village. He's on the right.

3.  Marissa can be found on Wispy Path in the upper right corner of
    where Espurr played with you.

4.  Matthew can be found on Route 3, the second bridge from the bottom.

5.  Cybur can be found on Route 3, next to the mystery egg vendor.

These are the only five we can get before we get a few more HM's, so
return to the Lost Camp and there'll be a few new things we can do.

First, Maman will let us donate again. Donate another $2500, and the
camp will be upgraded for a second time! Exit and return.

A few orphans will sell you stuff in camp!

Lost Camp: Andrew Shop

|Item          |Price|
|--------------|-----|
|*Pomeg Berry* |$600 |
|*Kelpsy Berry*|$600 |
|*Qualot Berry*|$600 |
|*Hondew Berry*|$600 |
|*Grepa Berry* |$600 |
|*Tamato Berry*|$600 |

Lost Camp: Matthew Shop

|Item         |Price|
|-------------|-----|
|*Water Stone*|$2100|
|*Fire Stone* |$2100|
|*Leaf Stone* |$2100|

As an aside, if you want quick AP, we can use Matthew's stones to fill
out a lot of categories Fill up a team with Pickup mons (pickup points),
then catch lots of Pansage/Pansear/Panpour (catching points).
Alternatively, breed them (egg hatching points and walking around
points). Catch any shinies you find as well (catch shiny points). Then,
using money you've gotten from selling Pickup items (selling points),
buy stones from Matthew (buying points) and use them to evolve each of
your monkeys. (evolution points and evolve-by-stone points).

Return to Gearen City, and exchange the Bike Voucher for a *Bicycle!*
Gotta go fast.

I recommend also at this point buying the Golden Surfboard and, if you
have the AP, the Golden Claws. We won't be able to come back here for a
little while after getting surf, so if you don't want to burden your
party, get the surfboard now.

Level up Slugma to Level 38 to get **Magcargo.** Add it and Emolga to
your party, then head back to Route 2's trailer to get *Charcoal* and
*Magnet,* as well as *TM96 Nature Power!*

## Mystery Egg

There's one more quest we can do. This will get us a very strong
Pokemon, but if you're not interested, go ahead and skip to the Route 4
section.

Go back through Wispy Ruins to Goldenleaf Town, then take the truck to
get to Sheridan Village. We're gonna take the female Phantump we caught
and breed it at the day care. Of what we have, male Cacnea, Oddish,
Bellsprout, Sunkern, Cherubi, Slugma, and Shuppet are all good choices
for partners if you have them. Once you get a Phantump egg, make sure it
doesn't hatch, and walk to Route 3.

This will only work during the daytime, but return to the Route 3
market, and talk to the boy in front of the old man. He'll offer you a
trade of the mystery egg he just got for your Phantump egg.

The mystery egg is unfortunately determined as you start your save file,
so it cannot be re-determined by save resetting. Anyways, the mystery
egg will be one of these Pokemon: **Azurill, Aron, Absol, Togepi,
Sneasel, Dhelmise, Aevian Litwick, Axew, Mienfoo, Pawniard, Trapinch,
Mudbray, Cottonee, Darumaka, Hatenna, Starly, Tyrunt, Larvesta,
Mareanie, Stufful, Rookidee.** These will all be available at some point
later in the game (though not necessarily this version), so don't fret
if you don't get your favorite right now.

For now, head back to Route 4 through Wispy Path.

## Akuwa Town?

Now we can explore Akuwa Town a bit. Itemfinder at the entrance to the
town will get you a *Super Repel.* There's an egg in the bottom right
corner of town. Once it hatches, you'll get **Ducklett!** There's also
wild Pokemon in the grass.

Akuwa Town

| Grass: Morning | %  | Grass: Day    | %  | Grass: Night   | %    |

| Seel           | 30       |


Head up to the gym area, but before you go in, directly head east.
Behind a tree you'll find Jessibelle, the sixth of nine *lost kids* who
you can send to the lost camp. To the left of the gym is a *Modest
Mint.*

Enter the house to the north of the trucker:

ZCell 015: Akuwa Town

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image15.png"
style="width:6.63542in;height:5.03125in" />

Talk to Aelita and then enter the Pokemon Center and go to the back to
get a *Defibrillator,* then use it on the old guy. Head down to the
beach area -- here you'll be able to fight wild **Corsola.** You'll also
find *TM135 Brine.* Hidden on the beach is a *Soda Pop.*

Head up and up the ladder you'll see here and grab:

ZCell 016: Akuwa Town (ignore the Ditto!)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image16.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.04167in" />

At this point we will not be able to come back for a bit, so make sure
you're ready with all the Pokemon you want to catch on this island for
now, and every quest you wanted to finish.

Once you're ready, head into the Aquarium/gym and go into the backroom.
You don'

## Blacksteeple Castle

Blacksteeple is one of my favorite sections of this game, but its very
story driven and has relatively few battles, items, wild Pokemon and the
like. I'll be telegraphing every move you must do during this part of
the game, but I also do believe it's more fun to play this part without
referencing any guide unless you get stuck. We won't be able to come
back later (at least in this version), so it might be a good idea to
scan this section after you're done to ensure you don't miss anything.
As a note - the outdoor section in the middle will be referred to as the
courtyard, the east section will be the quarry, and the left section
will be the fields.

### Day 1

We'll wake up in the cells. Go to sleep.

Relationship Point Choices:
- How did you? (Neutral)  
- You know, the usual. (Saki +1)

Exit the only way you can, then make your way outside and to the east to
the quarry. Head down into the mines and talk to Saki.

Accept the fast travel, then talk to everyone in the mine. Once you do,
the bottom area will open. Beat the trainer, then head to the sigil at
the top of the mine.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Where's Aelita? (Neutral)  
- Are we done here? (Aelita -1)

Exit Neved's office and head back down the stairs and head all the way
up into the colorful door. Talk to the crew, then exit the room. If you
go into the battle room and exit to the right, you can access some grass
with wild Pokemon.

Blacksteeple Castle

| Grass         | %        |
|---------------|----------|
| **Tangela**   | 45       |
| **Teddiursa** | 25       |
| **Cramorant** | 15       |
| **Abomasnow** | 4        |
| **Ursaring**  | 4        |
| **Delibird**  | 2        |

I recommend catching everything here, in particular Cramorant, who we
can't get later on.

Head back to your bed and get some sleep.

### Day 2

Head on out and talk to the crew. Enter the door in the southwest
corner, talk to the left guard to access the shop.

Blacksteeple Castle Shop

|Item          |Price|
|--------------|-----|
|*Poke Ball*   |$200 |
|*Great Ball*  |$600 |
|*Ultra Ball*  |$1200|
|*Super Potion*|$700 |
|*GourmetTreat*|$1500|
|*Repel*       |$350 |
|*Super Repel* |$500 |
|*Escape Rope* |$550 |

Talk to the right guard, then head into the courtyard. On the right-side
upper level, you'll find a kid, battle him to get the *Mining Kit.*

Enter the quarry again and talk to Adam.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I won it. (Neutral)
- I stole it. (Adam -1)

All those glowing rocks around can be mined for items, just like in 4th
gen. The item probabilities within are as follows:

| *Splash Plate*   | 0.3%          |
| *Pixie Plate*    | 0.3%          |

These items can be nice to pick up, but you'll be able to get them all
over the story so don't stress too much right now. Once we can revive
fossils, I will mention them all at once, but feel free to mine at your
leisure. If you save in front of a rock and press F12, you can reset the
items within.

Break all the rocks, talk to Adam, and use the *Blast Powder* he gives
you. Head left and talk to him again.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Calm down. (Adam +1)  
- You're useless! (Adam -2)

Beat the trainer. After all that, head into the battle room.

### Night 2

Now you'll control Emma for a bit. Make your way through the path and
all the way to the right. After the first minecart goes, head left and
up the hill to talk to a robot for a battle. Push it into its spot, then
repeat with the robot to the left. Finally fly over the pit at the
bottom and fight the third robot and push it into its place.

Head into this room, then interact with the computer.

### Day 3

Head out and watch all the scenes. When you regain control, it's time
for 3v3 battles in the battle room. The first two are easy, however the
last is against Emma.

Hooded Girl Emma (No Field)

-   Zoroark, Level 37.
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Grass Knot
-   Gardevoir, Level 38.
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Psychic
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Calm Mind
-   Meganium, Level 38.
    -   Nature Power
    -   Magical Leaf
    -   Leech Seed
    -   Poison Powder

These three can all be threatening in their own way but choosing the
right three will net you the victory easily.

Next, enter the library on top of the stairs, and read the purple
bookshelf. Then head to the garden area to the left of the courtyard. Go
up at the tree at the top, to reach a secret area.

Relationship Point Choices:
- It was barely a riddle. (Neutral)  
- I was stumped. (Saki +1)

Enter the hut to talk to the crew.

Back in the garden, walk up the stairs on the right to interact with the
crew by the sigil. Then reenter the castle and talk to Valarie at the
dining hall.

### Night 3

In the prestige room, talk to the candelabra then the bookshelf.

Next, you'll play as Emma again. Head to the battleship first. Then
sneak your way through the courtyard and then the castle to reach the
third floor. Enter Neved's room, then the room to the right.

Back outside enter the library and talk to the wide blue bookshelf on
the left. Then talk to the bookshelf in the middle, then beat the
trainer.

### Day 4

There's an impossible battle coming up as soon as we do the next
cutscene, so make sure if you want to win add Fletchling with Quick
Guard to your party.

Enter the secret garden area again and enter the hut. After a lot of
scenes, head back to the secret garden and down the stairs. Push through
the false wall, then again on the right.

Relationship Point Choices:
- We're getting out. (PianoLady +2)
- I'm here to help. (PianoLady +1)
- We're screwed. (PianoLady -1)

Go right and up.

Xen Executive Madelis (Cave Field)

-   Cinccino, Level 36.
    -   Bullet Seed
    -   Rock Blast
    -   Tail Slap
    -   Encore
-   Tsareena, Level 37.
    -   Trop Kick
    -   Bounce
    -   Nature Power
    -   Low Sweep
-   Sharpedo, Level 38. @ Focus Sash.
    -   Bounce
    -   Crunch
    -   Psychic Fangs
    -   Waterfall
-   Florges, Level 37.
    -   Nature Power
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Synthesis
    -   Giga Drain
-   Salazzle, Level 37.
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Foul Play
    -   Toxic
-   Houndoom, Level 39. @ Wise Glasses.
    -   Flamethrower
    -   Dark Pulse
    -   Nasty Plot
    -   Sludge Bomb

Be wary of Cinccino, as its 5-hit rock blast is boosted by the cave and
tail slap hits hard. Her Houndoom and Salazzle can hit hard but if you
can shut them down with a strong Rock or Water type, you'll be ok.

Outside, Nancy will join up with you! Beat the guards as you go. She has
a Level 65 Sylveon (!) so you shouldn't have to worry much. Once you get
to the courtyard, head back up to Neved's office.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Are you okay? (Aelita +3)
- I looked for you... (Aelita +2)
- We gotta get to the top! (Aelita +1)
- No time to catch up! (Aelita -1

Follow the stairs all the way up and prepare for battle. Aelita will
join your party for this one.

Xen Executive Neved (No Field)

-   Crabominable, Level 41. @ Occa Berry.
    -   Ice Punch
    -   Drain Punch
    -   Rock Slide
    -   Crabhammer
-   Tentacruel, Level 41. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   Sludge Bomb
    -   Dazzling Gleam
    -   Blizzard
    -   Scald
-   Vikavolt, Level 42.
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Bug Buzz
    -   Air Slash
    -   Thunder Wave
-   Manectric, Level 43. @ Magnet.
    -   Thunderbolt
    -   Hidden Power Ice
    -   Volt Switch
    -   Flamethrower
-   Aevian Palossand, Level 44. @ Never Melt Ice.
    -   Ice Beam
    -   Shadow Ball
    -   Giga Drain
    -   Moonlight
-   Barbaracle, Level 45. @ Sitrus Berry.
    -   X-Scissor
    -   Night Slash
    -   Razor Shell
    -   Rock Slide

Neved has a team that's entirely above your level cap, but you also get
to effectively 12 on 6 him with Aelita on your side, so it's not too
tough of a fight. Manectric is insanely fast and likes to one-shot
Aelita's Pokemon, so take it out quickly if you can. Crippling
Crabominable with a burn or attack lower might be a good strategy while
you clean up the left side. Watch out for Barbaracle too which hits
surprisingly hard. Anyways, just keep up the pressure and make sure the
fastest mons is out, then you and Aelita should be able to win.

Well….

Madame X (No Field)

-   Yveltal, Level 100. @ Soul Stone.
    -   Decimation

This is one of those ‘impossible' RPG battles. Ultimately, you're
supposed to lose this one obviously, but if you're crafty, the game will
acknowledge your victory should you manage to succeed with +1 Karma.

Decimation is a priority move, but it ignores abilities. Hence, we have
to use Quick Guard! Decimation has 20 PP and Quick Guard starts with 15.
TWO Pokemon with Quick Guard can drain its PP with Quick Guard, then
watch it struggle to death!

Whether you win or lose, watch the next scenes play out.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You came to save me? (Neutral)
- Thank you... (Neutral)
- I could've done it myself. (Aelita -1)

Goodbye Blacksteeple Castle!

## Xen Battleship

We'll wake up on the ship with Adam.

Relationship Point Choices:
- ... (Neutral)
- Don't feel guilty. (Adam +1)
- Maybe so. (Adam +2)

Grab the Poke Ball at the table to get **Mawile.**

There's an Audino breeder in here, and each time you win you'll be given
5 *Exp. Candy M*.

Exit the room and head down then to the right.

Relationship Point Choices:         

- It's okay. (Melia +2)  
- I don't know... (Melia -1)  
- ... (Melia -1)

Your *Snag Machine* will finally be fixed! Reenter the interior and head
down the stairs to the right to grab the *Dull Key!* We'll be using this
a bit later.

There's also the Akuwa town merchant here:

which case the type is the user's primary type \| Special \| 80 power \|
100% accuracy \| Increased critical hit rate.

Melia has added three more Pokemon since last time, but her team is
nothing too much for us, especially after Madelis and Neved.

After you win, head out to the deck and talk to Melia again.

## Terajuma Shore

Once you beach, you'll have to battle two rangers. Winning grants +3
Melia relationship points, while losing takes away -3 Melia relationship
points.

Back on the ship, head up the two ladders to reach *TM136 Assurance.*
Head down from the ship, and you'll see a **Pyukumuku** on the shore.

Terajuma Island

Hidden on this beach is a *Grass Gem.* Talk to Nim at the bottom.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Are you okay? (Nim +2)  
- We're ready to go. (Neutral)

Go to the east. Pick the two *Passho Berries*. Use the itemfinder on
this side to find *Soda Pop* and *Fresh Water.*

eventually, so buy them here. You'll see a guy here who will offer to
boat us back to Gearen City for a price - a way to go free will open up
a bit after the upcoming gym fight, so I would recommend waiting unless
you need something from Floria Island for the fight.

When you're ready, head into Terajuma Jungle to the north.

There are also Hoppip flying around in the mornings. Via itemfinder, on
the right side pick up a *Sitrus Berry.* Towards the left is a *Fire
Gem.*

Once you've gotten a feel for the middle area, talk to the group of your
friends, specifically Melia, on the left side. We're going to have to
take the long way, so head into the left path and into the cave.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Four, is that enough? (Melia +1)
- What's a badge? (Melia +2)
- Can't I just swim? (Valarie +1)

After a brief conversation there's just one thing left to do for this
section!

## Dewdrop Badge

Once you've healed, talk to Valarie outside for her gym battle.

Aquabatics: Water \| Status \| Raises the user's Special Attack and
Speed by 1 stage each.

So, this is the first *hard* gym battle, at least from my experience.
Ground moves do nothing (even Mud Bomb/High Horsepower for some reason),
so for Qwilfish and Lanturn you have to think of something else. Her
Qwilfish and Floatzel have Swift Swim, so they will normally outspeed
you and hit hard. Lanturn and Primarina are a bit slower but if you let
them get off Aquabatics (special Dragon Dance) then they can steamroll
your team. Watch out for Dewgong, too, whose Hydration ability allows it
to heal all the way up to full every turn with Rest. If you can get past
the first two fast attackers though, a strong physical set up sweeper
might be able to get through the rest of her team. An alternative is to
transform the field: 2 uses of Sludge Wave turns it into Murkwater,
which takes away some of her advantages and can help a Poison-type
oriented team, though she can turn it back with Lanturn and Dewgong's
Whirlpool.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You're strong... (Neutral)  
- It was pretty even. (Neutral)  
- Ez. (Valarie -2)

# Chapter 6: Nimpossible Predicament

## Terajuma Island Surfing

Head back to where you had the battle, then talk to Melia to get *HM03
Surf!*

First thing's first: we can now explore all the bodies of water we want
with Surf. There're just a few things we can do on the pier and shore
areas, then we'll continue in the jungle.

Start back at the first island map, where the shop is.

| Carvanha       | 1        |

Surf up to the top on the right side. Itemfind for a *Blue Shard.*

ZCell 017: Terajuma Island

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image17.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.02083in" />

Surf up at the bridge, on the left of the fence. Itemfinder points us to
a *Lemonade.* We can't do anything with the house, so head west one
screen to Terajuma Pier.

Go all the way to the left, then down. Surf down from here. Grab the
*Red Shard.* Afterwards, return to the jungle.

Once you're ready, enter Jirukala Cavern and surf around. On the right,
a rock will hide a *Rock Gem*. We can't rock climb yet, so exit to the
left. Go down and left.

After the scene, grab the 3 *Oran Berries,* and the *Dusk Ball.*

Jungle Store

*Poke Ball* $200

*Super Repel* $500

*Spice Powder* $850

Once you go inside the ranger station, meet with the group to the right.
Head back out, then go up at the first place you can. This map has a
slightly different set of encounters to that we've already seen.

Cross the bridge to the right, then head down to grab a *Full Heal.* Go
all the way up to Melia. You'll then have to battle the Carnivine,
though you can't catch it. Outcomes give Relationship Points: winning
grants +1 Melia, losing grants -1 Melia, running grants -2 Melia.

Follow her to the right. Itemfind for a *TinyMushroom* and grab the
*Sitrus Berries* and *Oran Berries.* Save/heal before you head right,
because a cutscene is about to take us into a battle!

Xen Executive Geara (Forest Field)

-   Persian, Level 41. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Night Slash

    -   Return

    -   Fake Out

    -   Slash and Burn

-   Clefable, Level 43. @ Pixie Plate.

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Bulk Up

    -   Sucker Punch

    -   False Surrender

    -   Spirit Break

    -   Earthquake

    -   Crunch

    -   Cut

    -   Rock Slide

-   Gengar, Level 43. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Sludge Wave

How did Geara level up/evolve his Pokemon in the altered dimension and
get a Krookodile? Who knows? Anyways, this is a tough fight for sure,
especially as he uses the field well. His Krookodile and Persian each
have boosted Grass moves, so be careful to not send in slower water
types. Marowak and Grimmsnarl can be pains if you let them set up, so
setting up rocks can help tremendously here. Overpower him with stronger
mons that counter his and you'll be fine.

As soon as you're done, we're back in a rift. Grab the *Rift Notes: Code
Sarpa*. Heal and switch out your party, grab the pulse notes, and get
ready.

Dimensional Rift Carnivine (Rift Field)

-   Carnivine, Level 45. @ Yache Berry. Type: Grass/Dragon. Stats:
    80/110/75/120/100/115. Ability: Thick Fat. 2 Shields.

    -   Coil

    -   Power Whip

    -   Gunk Shot

    -   Dragon Rush

Another battle with a Rift. This one tries to wear you down with Coil
boosts, so burning or otherwise keeping its attack low will be useful.
Wear it down defensively before too many Coils or switch to special
moves if you must. Even with its ability Ice moves are good, as are Bug,
Flying, Dragon, Fairy.

Enter the house here and grab the *Focus Band.* I recommend adding it to
something on your team that isn't holding an item - might as well give
your team an extra edge. Outside hidden is a *TinyMushroom.*

Exit and go to the right. Go down, as we can explore this upper area.
Itemfind for a *Great Ball, Wacan Berry,* and pick up:

ZCell 018: Terajuma Jungle

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image18.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.01042in" />

On the right you'll find a *Brave Mint* as well as a hidden *Super
Repel.*

Exit north to Kakori Village.

Talk to the characters at the village. You'll get a +1 Melia
Relationship Point if you've already helped take out Rift Gyarados in
Goldenwood Forest for the second time.

This moment clears some of the vines in the jungle, so we're going to
head back down to grab a few things quick. If you don't want to catch
more Pokemon or get some items, jump to the next section now.

Before we start, grab a Dunsparce from the Pokemon Center PC.

Re-enter the forest and talk to the first girl from the top. She'll tell
you she wants someone to watch her Growlithe. Like Espurr, we're gonna
need to get some affection with it. The fastest way to do it is to talk
to Aelita below:

Relationship Point Choices:
- Join me! (Aelita +1)  
- Nope. (Neutral)

Then, play ball with her and Growlithe… 31 times. Once you've done this,
tell it to follow you, then try to leave the forest to the north and
you'll get **Growlithe!** (+1 Karma)

Head left a map and enter the Weather Institute. The guy in the top
right will trade for your Dunsparce a **Castform!** You can do this
infinitely if you want, in fact.

Head back out and go down. Here you'll see a **Vileplume** in the
ground. Sprinkle the Spice Powder on it, and it will attack. Itemfind
for a *TinyMushroom,* then cross the bridge to get 3 *Leppa Berries,* 3
*Pecha Berries,* a *Tanga Berry,* and *Blast Powder.* Save this one!

Head left a map, then go down. After taking out another Vileplume with
Spice Powder, you'll have access to *Quick Powder* and another cell.

ZCell 019: Deep Terajuma Jungle

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image19.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.01042in" />

Head up then all the way left. On the bridge, a girl will get upset at
you and request 20 Sitrus Berries. We will be able to buy them in a
little bit. Make your way to the northwest side of this map, get the
hidden *Bug Gem,* then go into the clearing.

Just like the Pom-Pom Meadow back in Floria, here's another meadow with
another form of Oricorio to be found.

Hula Meadow

|                     |          |

| **Toucannon**       | 4        |
| Grubbin             | 1        |
| **Oranguru**        | 1        |

Grab two Oranguru if you can - one will be traded away later. In the
pot, you can find infinite *Pink Nectar.* That's all we can do here, so
head back to the jungle. There's still one thing left to do before we
proceed into the village… bet you weren't expecting a legendary Pokemon
so early, were you?

Exit the jungle south to return to the pier. At nighttime, Surf in the
bottom section of this area, and you'll be able to interact with wild
**Phione** for a GourmetTreat! Return to the village to progress the
story.

## Kakori Village and Jeminra Woods

In the town, itemfind around for 2 *TinyMushrooms.* In the top left, use
another Spice Powder on Vileplume to get to a hidden… *TinyMushroom.*

Enter the third house from the left, on the upper row of houses below
the cliffside. Talk to the woman, and she'll run off to the Xen
Battleship. We'll get to her once we have an easier way to get to the
pier from here.

Kakori Village Pokemart

*Great Ball* $600

*Super Potion* $700

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Repel* $350

*Super Repel* $500

*Ice Heal* $250

*Burn Heal* $250

*Paralyze Heal* $200

*Escape Rope* $550

*Spice Powder* $850

Also, in the mart, if you'd like, trade in your Up-Grade with a girl to
get *Scope Lens!* We'll get another Up-Grade shortly, so don't worry
about this one.

There's an entrance to the Safari Zone in the northeast side of town, so
go ahead and enter for $3500.

You'll get 800 steps and 30 Poke Balls per run. I recommend grabbing a
Level 35-38 Pokemon and a lot of repels - most of the 1% encounter
Pokemon (not Wobbuffet, though) are higher level than the rest, so you
can parse for them via repels.

Get two Spinda - we will be trading one away later.

You can also find: a *Rare Candy,* a *Reverse Candy, Hyper Potion,
TinyMushroom, Super Repel, Friend Ball* in this area. We can't access
the island to the east yet, but there's one more area we can reach for
now.

Use the Spice Powder on the Vileplume in Area 5, then follow the path up
and right across the rocks.

We can't battle our Pokemon yet, therefore, we can't purify this cave
quite yet. We'll get back to it. That's about all we can do here.

Back at the gate, if you managed to survive the suffering and find a
Chansey, show it to the girl for the *Oval Charm!* This will help us
find eggs in the day care more often.

We actually have access to Route 6's grass at this point, west of
Kakori. There is also a hidden *Star Piece* out here.

Talk to the guy in the top right and give him 5 Oran Berries to get the
*Wailmer Pail!*

Enter the hallway at the top. In the community rec room, a girl will
give you a *Weakness Policy*. In the room above that, grab the
*Up-Grade* then talk to the girl in the corner.

If you've done all the other virtual badge battles, she'll let us
continue the quest.

Gym Leader Chuck (Glitch Field)

-   Primeape, Level 29. @ Rock Gem.

    -   Revenge

    -   Focus Energy

    -   Rock Tomb

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Focus Blast

    -   Waterfall

    -   Hypnosis

If you've chosen Quilava, switch right away for Steelix: one Curse and
one Gyro Ball should be able to outplay Primeape. On Poliwrath you want
to get Qwilfish in for Toxic Spikes, then let Jolteon finish it off.
Steelix and Quilava should be able to handle the rest!

Talk to her again to take on Jasmine.

Gym Leader Jasmine (Glitch Field)

-   Magneton, Level 36.

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Sonic Boom

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Iron Tail

    -   Curse

    -   Rock Tomb

Immediately switching to Steelix to get off some curses will easily get
you through Magneton 1 and Skarmory - then you should switch to eat the
HP Fire. Knock out Magneton 2 with Miltank and Qwilfish, then let
Qwilfish go off on Steelix. This should leave Typhlosion to finish
Steelix and one shot Scizor, despite the Occa Berry. Once you win,
you'll get the sixth *Virtual Badge.*

In the third room from the right in the hallway, grab the *Escape Rope.*

In the upper hallway, head left, and you'll go through a cutscene with
Melia (+2 Melia Relationship Points, +2 Aelita). Return to the HQ and
enter the last room on the left. After that, head back outside and go to
Route 5.

    -   Swords Dance

    -   Return

    -   Shadow Claw

This is an easy battle compared to Valarie. That said, watch out for
Type: Null, who can live thanks to Eviolite and set up to hit you hard.
Also, potentially threatening is Typhlosion, whose Nature Power turns
into a +3 Attack Meditate.

After the battle, head up.

Head up to Valor Mountain and watch the scene.

## Dexoy Attack

You'll be placed back in Terajuma Jungle, so return to the south
entrance.

We're gonna be battling some “Dexoys” here, which are Level 45 Deoxys
with Thunderbolt, Psychic, Shadow Ball, and Flash Cannon. Obviously,
they're tough to take out, but in a pinch, you can find a strategy. Head
to the west first, then the east.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- I'm alright. (Melia +2)  
- Could be worse. (Melia +1)  
- Terrible. (Neutral)

Relationship Point Choices:
- So.. We're on our own? (Melia +1)  
- Well, that sucks... (Neutral)  
- Can we ask again? (Melia +2)

Enter the room to the left.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Get me out. (Melia +1)  
- I have a Relic to get. (Neutral)  
- A + A = B - B + 3. (Venam +2)

Now is a good time to do the help quests.

## Kakori Help Quests

HQuest 13: Clear the Way!!

Enter Terajuma Jungle and head south onto the hill and talk to the
hiker. We're gonna need to find 7 black shards around the forest.

1.  Immediately right of the hiker

2.  In the map to the left, next to the stacks of wood by the Timburr

3.  Heading left across the bridge and to the left, north by the broken
    bridge

4.  South -\> west -\> north across the bridges from \#3

5.  North from \#4, in the meadow.

6.  In the bottom left side of the map where you fought Valarie

7.  Near the water at the bottom side of the entrance map

After you've gotten them, head back to the hiker. He's now cleared the
vines, so you can progress through the jungle easier!

Head into the cave in the water below, which is now opened. Grab the
*TM51 Steel Wing* and *Blast Powder.*

Return to the help center to get $4326! (+1 Karma)

HQuest 14: Bandit at Large

-   Head to the weather institute in the jungle. Talk to the girl near
    the Venusaur on the left.

-   Head to Route 5 and enter the empty shack on Valor Shore.

-   We're gonna need to find the Xen grunt hiding on each floor.

-   1F: In the middle stack of books

-   2F: In the box in the upper right corner

-   2F (#2): In the books in the center

-   3F: In the trash can on the top

-   3F (#2): In the horizontal lines of the bottom right big machine

-   3F (#3): In the pot on the top left

-   On the fourth level, grab the *Good Rod!*

-   Talk to her on the fourth level, and you'll have to battle. You'll
    be taken back to the weather institute.

-   Head back to Route 5 and all the way down to pick up another *Blast
    Powder.*

-   Return to the help center to get a **Bulbasaur** egg, a *Rare
    Candy,* and $5000! (+1 Karma)

HQuest 15: Building Bridges

Head to the lumber yard in Terajuma Jungle and enter the building. Talk
to the guy on the right, then Gurdurr. Head west to the bridge, and
we'll have to battle.

PokeGang Conkeldurr (Forest Field)

-   Timburr, Level 25.

-   Timburr, Level 35.

-   Timburr, Level 45.

-   Timburr, Level 55.

-   Timburr, Level 65.

-   Conkeldurr, Level 75.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Brick Break

    -   Thunder Punch

This is another double battle with one tough enemy at the very end.
Luckily, even at level 75 all the enemies are somewhat slow, so if you
can boost your offenses with a somewhat fast mon you might be able to
one shot it with something super effective. You can use the easy first
two Timburr as an excuse to set up a lot of entry hazards and/or set up
with moves like Dragon Dance. Either way, come up with a strategy to
take it out.

-   Once you win, head west and go up to the broken bridge.

-   Enter, then catch **Rowlet** in there. This is also where the Mossy
    Rock is located. Hidden is a *Red Shard* as well.

-   Return to the help center to get $4890 and a *Sun Stone!* (+1
    Karma)

HQuest 16: Find It!

-   Head to the ranger shack in the southwest corner of the jungle. Talk
    to Roggenrola, and it will follow you.

-   Exit the jungle towards Kakori, fighting AA Grunts along the way

-   Heal at the Kakori Pokemon center, then talk to the guy in the top
    left.

-   After one battle, return to the help center to get $4255. (+1
    Karma)

HQuest 17: Battle Me Again!

Time for another battle with Novae. Get your best team and head to the
Valor Shore.

Wanderer Novae (Ashen Beach)

-   Toucannon, Level 42. @ Yache Berry.

    -   Beak Blast

    -   Roost

    -   Bullet Seed

    -   Rock Blast

-   Vikavolt, Level 43. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Bug Buzz

    -   Air Slash

    -   Roost

-   Lycanroc, Level 45. @ Rock Gem.

    -   Stone Edge

    -   Crunch

    -   Accelerock

    -   Drill Run

-   Tsareena, Level 43. @ Grass Gem.

    -   Trop Kick

    -   Knock Off

    -   Play Rough

    -   Acrobatics

-   Palossand, Level 43. @ Leftovers.

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Shore Up

    -   Earth Power

    -   Giga Drain

-   Passimian, Level 45. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Iron Head

    -   Close Combat

    -   Brutal Swing

    -   Bulk Up

This is the hardest battle of hers yet. Almost all her Pokemon have
coverage out the wazoo! Passimian can hit hard if given the chance to
bulk up even once, and Vikavolt takes lives if you let it attack. Not to
mention speed demon Lycanroc probably able to take out at least one of
your team members at will. Not a ton of synergy or a central strategy
though. As before getting a team with near perfect synergy that counters
each of her mons and you might sneak out a victory. You can also wait
till the next level cap if you want to make this one easier.

Anyways, return to the help center to get $4500, 10 *Reverse Candies,*
10 *Max Repels,* and 10 *Super Potions.* (+1 Karma)

If you've done all the help quests, your reward is access to the safari
zone garden. We'll get this to a bit. Enter the door that the AA grunt
came out of.

You'll be entered into a 6v6 double battle, but if you can take Novae
you should be able to handle this one. Grab the *TM57 Charge Beam* and
the *Center Keys* here, as well as an *Exp. Candy M.*

That's it for the help quests.

Now, one more quest we can do. Enter the Xen Battleship, and the girl
from earlier will be here. Talk to her, and she'll run to the deck.
After you talk to her again, she'll go into the main room. Finally,
follow her to the very top through Augustus' room. That's all we can do
here for now, so back in Kakori, enter the house of the girl who we took
to the boat, and she'll give you a *Destiny Knot.*

Now that we have the Good Rod, there are a couple new Pokemon we can
obtain in these areas.

Grab the *TM123 Self Destruct* while you're here!

We're now gonna go find Rorim B.

This battle isn't really meant to be hard, and once Bellossom and

You can do it! Get the *Sky Relic.*

Accept the fast travel. Talk to Rorim B, and he'll take you to the
Secret Shore.

If it is raining outside, you can find stationary Gastrodon to fight.
Note that you can also find many *Absorb Bulbs* by interacting with them
in this area.

A *Dusk Ball, Revive,* and a *Pearl* are hidden on the first island.

To the right, you'll see a brown book on the ground. If you gave away
your *Ancient Book*, here's where you can get a new one. Otherwise,
leave it here for now.

Maneuver up on the first island to where you can access the water from
two points. We can't do anything from the left yet, so surf up from the
right. Head to the right island and cut the tree, accessing the water on
the north side of this island. Head up to the next and talk to Melia.

Surf west from here and grab the *Pretty Wing.* Head up and enter the
lab.

After a cutscene, head to the west. We must do an arrow puzzle.

Room 1

-   Take the left upwards arrow above Aelita

-   Head up and take the rightwards arrow.

-   Head down to the downwards facing arrow

-   Fight a trainer with a shadow **Masquerain,** so catch it if you

-   Press the panel here

-   Take the bottom left downward arrow

-   Go up one tile, then right. You'll fight a trainer with a shadow
    Baltoy.

-   Return to the bottom, then get back to this area. Instead, take the
    upward arrow to the left of the trainer.

-   Leave the blue panel alone, and head up

-   Press the purple panel then take the rightward arrow

-   Ignore this pink panel and go down

-   Press the orange panel

-   Go up onto the leftward arrows onto the pink -\> blue -\> orange
    path and we're done!

There are Pokemon in here.

Room 3

-   Head up in the only possible path

-   Take the right facing arrow on the right side

-   Return to the area by the barrels on the right

-   Head up into the Xen grunt, who has a shadow Galarian Stunfisk**.**

-   Activate the pink panel and fight the grunt

-   Head down and activate the blue panel.

-   Head right, up and right, then up and right to get to *TM73 Thunder
    Wave!*

-   Head back down, left, left up, and from here return to the upper
    left region as we've done before

-   Instead, take the upper right upwards arrow that leads to the upper
    right.

-   Take the rightwards arrow that takes you through the pink path and
    we're out.

Heal, and we're going to fight in the next room.

Pokemon Trainer Ren (Factory Field)

-   Cacturne, Level 42. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Spikes

    -   Nature Power

    -   Dark Pulse

-   Reuniclus, Level 42. @ Colbur Berry.

    -   Recover

    -   Psyshock

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Signal Beam

-   Scyther, Level 43. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Bug Bite

    -   Aerial Ace

    -   Brick Break

    -   Steel Wing

-   Flygon, Level 43. @ Yache Berry.

    -   Dragon Dance

    -   Earthquake

    -   Steel Wing

    -   Dragon Claw

-   Arcanine, Level 44. @ Liechi Berry.

    -   Flare Blitz

    -   Wild Charge

    -   Extremespeed

    -   Reversal

-   Greninja, Level 44. @ Expert Belt.

    -   Surf

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Night Slash

    -   Grass Knot

Another tough battle with Ren - his team is almost fully complete, with
only Scyther left to evolve. His team, or at least the last four
members, are extremely fast, so you must find mons that can live his
attacks and dish it back. Cacturne likes to lay spikes. Be careful of
technician Scyther which can hit hard, and protean Greninja as always.

Afterwards, enter the hidden cave. After a cutscene, we'll be taken back
out to the entrance of the forest. Accept the fast travel to head back
to Kakori.

Rorim B will now take us to Oceana Pier from Terajuma Shore for free, so
now is a good time to return.

## Floria Island Surfing and Side Quests

Talk to Rorim B at Terajuma Pier, and you can return to Oceana Pier.

Talk to Dragonite in Oceana Pier. He's lost some letters, so we're going
to help pick them up for it. The first is immediately up and left from
it. The second is left behind some trees. The third is in the upper left
corner between some dumpsters. Give them back to get a *Thunderstone!*

Talk to the woman with the cart by the Gearen City Entrance. She'll
offer you a *Link Heart* for $10000. This will evolve a trade evolution
for us, so I recommend grabbing it now.

Enter the Magnolia Library and talk to Zumi upstairs to get our next
quest. She's looking for Pyukumuku, which we already have. She'll give
us 6 *Exp. Candy M.* Our next quest is for Mareep!

The Shopping Emporium has new wares for us now that we have five badges:

Poke Ball Emporium New Items (5 Badges)

*Timer Ball* $1000

*Dive Ball* $1000

Berry Emporium New Item (5 Badges)

*Sitrus Berry* $750

Buy 20 of these to give to the girl on the bridge if you'd like.

Next, head to the basement of Chrisola hotel. Surf to the dark patch in
the water at night and use a GourmetTreat to get **Totodile!** Also,
grab the *Water Stone.*

There are also a couple new items in the AP shop.

Head up, and you'll get *Berry Ice Cream* from Karen. *TM118 Pin
Missile* is here as well. The area beyond is Wispy Ruins, but we can't
explore much as we don't have Rock Climb yet. Return to the town.

Talk to Dragonite in the square - it's lost its letters again!

The first is south of the pair of houses, in the southwest corner of the
town. The second letter is on the hill south of the cemetery. The third
is in the grass area at the bottom. Finally, the fourth on the hill to
the right of Narcissa's house. Once we have all four, talk to Dragonite
to get *TM113 Brutal Swing!*

battle!

The door is locked for now, but we'll be back after our next badge. Surf
out of here to the north to return to Goldenleaf Town and take the truck
to Akuwa Town.

## Route 4 Second Visit

Enter Route 4 from Akuwa Town.

Head all the way to the entrance by Wispy Ruins. Surf up at the top of
the mountain: you'll find Teddy here, the eighth of the nine *lost kids*
for the Lost Camp side quest. There is also another den here!

RIFT DEN 3 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are
Herdier, Crabrawler, Pachirisu, and Chimecho. The rare ones are
**Rhyhorn**, Vanillite, and **Purugly**.

Head north to cross the leftmost bridge: surfing here leads us to the
fourth den.

RIFT DEN 4 (\< 8 Badges): The common encounters in this second den are
Lotad, Gastrodon, and Palpitoad. The rare ones are Mantyke and
**Frillish.**

That's all that we can do here for now. You might have enough Rift

Head back to Akuwa Town.

Health Wing* on the islands. First, surf east to Route 11.

Hidden on the first island is a *Dire Hit.* Grab the *Red Shard*, then
talk to the Xen Grunt… He wants 10 Sweet Hearts. Buy them from the Route
3 Vendor if you haven't yet, then return.

Beat the grunt, and you'll be engaged in battle with a level 40
**Jynx!**

Starting to the south, use your itemfinder on the islands to find *HP
Up, Adamint Mint, Red Shard, Blue Shard, Jolly Mint.* Pick up the
*Ether.* To the right, you'll find Poliwag \#3!

Catch two Sandshrew here, we are gonna trade one away in a bit. The
water encounters we can access in just a little bit. Nothing else we can
do here yet.

Head out, and up to Evergreen Island north of Route 11.

Evergreen Island

|                   |          |                 |          |

| Binacle           | 5        |                 |          |

Talk to the Octillery here to battle them.

Attempt to enter the forest, and Nana will stop you. She'll invite you
to her home, so head in. She'll give you the *Mysterious Emblem.* This
will also give you access to a PC and bed, which we'll be using a lot in
this section.

Grab something from the PC with Blizzard, and something with either
Magnitude, Earthquake, or Bulldoze. The best choice is training a
Castform to 35 for Blizzard, and any Pokemon who'll learn the Bulldoze
T.M. Also, grab something with Heat Wave, Flame Burst, Lava Plume, or
Eruption. Salandit from the safari zone also has one of these.

Then, surf to the cave in the middle here and use Blizzard in a battle.
After the field has changed, use the ground move, and a path will open.
Enter and surf to battle **Lapras!**

Heal at Nana's house again, then pick up a hidden *Heart Scale* and
enter the cave to the right.

Use the fire move in battle, then surf across. Exit the southeast ladder
to get:

ZCell 029: Evergreen Island

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image29.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.03125in" />

Enter again and take the ladder down. We can't yet do the strength
puzzle portion, but we can explore. Beat the trainers then grab the *X
Special.* Hidden is a *Zinc, Rare Candy,* and *Full Heal.* Hop into the
hole all the way at the bottom. Grab the *DeepSeaScale* then head
through the hole. We can't do anything in this area yet, but we will
come back. Head back up the ladder twice. Jump down the leftmost hole to
get *DeepSeaTooth.* In this path you'll find the Icy Rock. That's all we
can do for now without strength, so head back out of the cave.

Finally, enter the forest.

Evergreen Forest

There are also Swablu that fly around here. There is a stationary
Stantler to the right in the forest, as well as **Buneary**. Catch two
for a trade!

There are lots of *Snowballs* on the ground we can pick up. Hidden
around the entrance areas are a *Max Repel,* and *Genius Wing.* Head up
and to the right for a *Dusk Ball* on the mountain.

Head back to the middle area. Hidden as you head up and to the dead end
on the left is *Ice Heal, Ice Gem*, *Paralyze Heal, Hyper Potion, Zinc,*
and *Genius Wing.* Surf across the pond we passed earlier. Hidden on
this path is *Resist Wing, HP Up, Rare Candy,* and *Magical Seed.* At
night we can battle stationary Snorunt.

Head back down and surf back across the pond. Go up and right to find a
hidden *X Special.* Finally go all the way up to the spring and grab the
*Max Repel.* Whether you got Anju's Pendant or not, the Mysterious
Emblem will allow you to enter the spring of preservation at the top.

Enter the spring and talk to the **Piplup** for a battle.

One more thing we can do in this area for now: evolve one of your
Buneary via happiness into **Lopunny,** then trade it with the person on
Evergreen Island for a **Shroomish.**

That's all we can do in the Route 11 area.

Take the boat to Terajuma, then surf up in this spot to return to where
we got Valarie's badge, and get Poliwag \#4. Head up to Valor Shore and
surf up for Poliwag \#5.

Head up and talk to Dragonite! He's lost all his letters again. The
first is on the island immediately to the right. The second is on an
island around a loop dead south of Dragonite. The third is dead east of
the second. Finally, the fourth is on Route 5 in the grass on the left.
Talk to Dragonite again to get a *Shiny Stone.*

Return to the Terajuma Jungle, and find the girl who wants the berries.
Give them to her and you'll be able to buy some mulch.

Terajuma Jungle Mulch Shop

*Growth Mulch* $200

*Stable Mulch* $200

That's all we can do for this massive load of quests, so head back to
Crawli's gym.

## Infested Badge

Enter Crawli's gym in the ranger HQ once you have prepped your team.
Talk to Holly at the entrance, then enter one of the caves and talk to
her again - and our challenge will begin.

-   Push the first log on the left to the left

-   Push the second log on the left up

-   Push the third log up, and you'll battle wild **Pinsir!**

-   Hop the center of this log, then go up and hop over the next center
    of the next log

-   Talk to Ariados in the bottom corner, then talk to Holly at the top

-   In this new room, hop over the log on the left side then talk to
    Ariados.

-   Push the log above on the left to fight another Pinsir.

-   Hop over it, then smash the rock smash rocks in the area.

-   Talk to the Ariados on the right side, then push the log on the
    upper left side up one space

-   On the right side, push the bottom log down. Push the other log to
    the left, then up as far as it can go.

-   Follow this vertical log to the top, then push it left, then up

-   Push the bottom horizontal log up again, then climb the stairs and
    hop across

-   Push the log on this platform up

-   Return to the platform, jump to the right side, then jump all the
    way across the platforms to the left on the logs we have now put in
    place, then talk to Holly

-   Head up, then hop to the left and talk to this Ariados. Up and to
    the right you can find:

ZCell 030: Kakori Gym

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image30.png"
style="width:6.66667in;height:4.98958in" />

-   Head back all the way down, and to the right. Climb the stairs by
    the teleporter

-   Push the log off the platform down, then use it to cross to the
    middle platform. Approach the tile that sticks out, and if you've
    found all the Ariados, an event will play.

-   Jump across and enter.

-   Talk to Holly, then get onto the bridge. Go to the right and surf
    down to grab *Bug Memory.* Back on the bridge, take the leap of
    faith!

Down in the bottom floor, you'll find a small tutor.

Kakori Gym Move Tutor

Giga Drain 3 Green Shards

Talk to Aelita at the top, then head in. Flying around in here are wild
**Yanma,** which you can catch. It can be useful for this fight if you
want to go train it up due to its strong AncientPower and Air Slash.
Anyways, pass Crawli and head into the cave at the top. Head left and
then follow this path down to get:

ZCell 031: Kakori Depths

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image31.png"
style="width:6.63542in;height:4.98958in" />

Anyways, if you head outside the gym, there's an Audino breeder by the
Pokemon Center. You'll get 5 *Exp. Candy M* each time you win. Once
you're ready, return to Crawli's chamber and stand across him!

Gym Leader Crawli (Forest Field, Raining)

-   Ariados, Level 43. @ Telluric Seed.

    -   Barbed Web

    -   Stomping Tantrum

    -   Poison Jab

    -   Shadow Sneak

-   Galvantula, Level 44. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Bug Buzz

    -   Sticky Web

    -   Thunder

    -   Rain Dance

-   Escavalier, Level 43. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Slash

    -   Iron Head

    -   Drill Run

    -   Barbed Web

-   Golisopod, Level 43. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   First Impression

    -   Aqua Jet

    -   Leech Life

    -   Liquidation

-   Pinsir, Level 44. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Storm Throw

    -   Throat Chop

    -   Barbed Web

    -   Rock Slide

-   Araquanid, Level 45. @ Mystic Water.

    -   Liquidation

    -   Sticky Web

    -   Barbed Web

    -   Poison Jab

Barbed Web: Bug \| Physical \| 75 power \| 100% accuracy \| Hits both
foes in a Double Battle \| Increased critical hit ratio. If the target's
side of the field already has Sticky Web, sets a layer of Spikes.

Ho boy, this is a tough battle if you're not prepared. Crawli's team
plays in doubles and basically has everything stacked for it - a field
that boosts almost all his Bug moves and gives Slash a grass typing,
rain that nullifies fire types entirely, and a well-structured team
built around speed control. Ariados will be +1 attack and immune to
damage for its first turn, but you can do the same with a Telluric Seed.
After Galvantula dies, he doesn't really have anything that is
inherently speedy - so if you can find a way to get rid of or ignore the
sticky web, you'll be able to wear him down. Rock Slide is great here -
everything bar Escavalier will go down to it handily.

You can also take advantage of the rain! Swift Swim will help you negate
the speed loss from the Sticky Web, plus rain boosted water moves.
Alternatively you can duke it out on Rainbow Field by changing the
weather to sunny.

Once you've triumphed, claim the Infested Badge for Pokemon up to level
50.

Head outside and talk to Melia and Valarie.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I sure did. (Melia +2)  
- It was a tough battle... (Neutral)  
- I lost. (Melia +4)

That's it for this part!

# Chapter 7: A Teila Fire and Ice

## Route 6 and Aquamarine Cave

After you're ready, head west out of Kakori Village to Route 6. We
already had access to the grass, but:

Route 6

There are also wild Krabby crawling around. Surf north and use
itemfinder for a *Pearl.*

Enter Aquamarine Cave and talk to Melia and Valarie.

Aquamarine Cave (Crystal Cavern Field)

|             |          |                 |     |                |          |

| Corsola     | 1        | Basculin        | 20  |                |          |

Talk to the guy at the bottom of the entrance to get *TM05 Roar.* Use
itemfinder around this room to get *Max Repel, Elemental Seed,* and
*Water Gem.*

Enter the room to the south. Use itemfinder to get 3 *Blue Shards,* 2
*Escape Ropes, Synthetic Seed,* and *Rock Gem.* Use your blast powder on
the mining rock on the right side: below it, pick up *Aquamarine Ore,
Water Stone,* as well as hidden *Reverse Candy* and *Rare Candy.* Talk
to Valarie to the left. Having this conversation at all grants (Valarie
+1 Relationship Point). Also:

Relationship Point Choices:
- I love water! (Valarie +1)  
- Water kind of scares me... (Valarie -3)  
- Pretty indifferent. (Neutral)

Surf down at where the fisherman is. Surf west and enter this cave.
After the scene, enter this door.

Hidden in here is *Red Shard,* 2 *Blue Shards,* and *Max Repel.* Grab
the *Water Gem* on the beach and go up. Surf across to talk to Saki, and
you'll have to battle 6 Sharpedo.

Surf to the left to find:

ZCell 032: Aquamarine Chamber

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image32.png"
style="width:6.61458in;height:4.97917in" />

Head back out and to the left. Heal, then exit the cave for a double
battle!

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Dynamic Punch

    -   Thunderpunch

    -   Bullet Punch

This team together relies heavily on the presence of Pelipper's rain -
if you can switch it to sun, their strategy will suffer. A combination
of Rock Slide, Blizzard, and Discharge can take out most of their team,
but honestly, their team is so slow you should be fine here once you get
strategy going.

Pick up hidden *Pearl* and *Calcium.* Head west to enter Teila Resort!

## Teila Resort First Visit

Head up and grab the planted *Occa Berry.* Useful for a certain gym
battle later. This building here is another ranger center, with a shop:

Teila Ranger Center Store

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Potion* $300

*Super Potion* $700

*Antidote* $100

*Ice Heal* $250

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Super Repel* $500

*Reverse Candy* $50

*Spice Powder* $850

Enter the hot springs to the north. This is where you can use the PC and
heal in this area, like in FRLG. There is also hidden *Blue Shard* and
*Fresh Water.*

Head out and follow the beach line to the north. Pick up the hidden
*Full Heal* and the *Lax Mint.*

Go down towards the villa all the way in the southeast. Outside, then
inside this building, you'll find:

ZCell 033: Teila Resort

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image33.png"
style="width:6.63542in;height:4.94792in" />

ZCell 034: Teila Resort

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image34.png"
style="width:6.62251in;height:5.00521in" />

Head around the house to the left of this one to find an *Elixir.* The
guy inside this house will offer to trade your extra Oranguru for a
**Passimian!**

Head around to the house in the southwest, and behind it you'll find a
*Rare Candy.* In the area near the house above this you'll find a *Hyper
Potion.*

There are some shops towards the center.

Teila Resort Left Vendor Store

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Super Potion* $700

*Full Heal* $600

*Antidote* $100

Teila Resort Right Vendor Store

*Apophyll Pancakes* $3000

*Tart Apple* $1100

*Sweet Apple* $1100

Head into the building with the gym sign at the top. Talk to Tesla and
Melia for a while, then talk to the guy in the bottom left corner with a
fighting type in your team to get a *Muscle Band!* then head into the
upper left room to find:  
ZCell 035: Teila Resort

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image35.png"
style="width:6.65625in;height:4.98958in" />

If you talk to the girl in the left side near Tesla, she'll offer your
Pokemon massage packages. The cheapest is $1500, the next is $3500,
and the last is $6500, which comes with *3 Fresh Waters* and 3
*Revives!* Each sequentially increases your Pokemon's happiness, though
if you want to get it up quickly, I still recommend the friendship
berries or Blue Moon Ice Creams.

## Aquamarine Cave 2nd Visit

Next, we must go find Amber, Tesla's kid. Re-enter Aquamarine Cave and
head back down to the bottom level. Head up once you reach the large
room, climbing some stairs to do so. Talk to the sleeping girl here.
She'll request we go get back a CD that Venam stole from her so… we're
heading to Kakori Village.

Now that we've visited the resort, all the warp panels in the Ranger
Center's we've visited so far are functional, making it easier than ever
to travel around Terajuma! Enter the Teila Ranger station and take the
warp panel to HQ, then visit Venam in the speaker room. Talk to her,
then head back to sleeping Amber in Aquamarine Cave.

After the cutscene, jump down the hole. After another scene, we'll get
control.

Pick up the hidden *Ether* and *Fresh Water.* We'll be back with Rock
Climb later, so head to the west to get back to the basement floor.
Interact with the slimy rock slide thing here to head back to where
we've been. Make your way back to Teila Resort!

## Teila Resort 2nd Visit

Return to the massage room to talk to the group. Then, exit and head to
Tesla's Villa. It's the furthest up building on the left side of the
resort.

Relationship Point Choices:
- This is Tesla's house... (Venam +3)

- Can I help? (Venam +1)

- Gross. (Venam -1)

Enter the room up and to the right.

If only one of the two trainers you fight had explosion on ALL FOUR OF
HER POKeMON (and one TWICE!). This is sort of a gag battle, so bait out
the explosions and you should be alright.

After the battle and the following conversation, head up in the hot
spring. Then talk to Tesla in her kitchen.

She'll offer you food - choose whichever you like. If you want something
sweet, you'll get a *Strawberry Cake!* If you want something relaxing,
you'll get a *Rose Tea!* If you want something rejuvenating, you'll get
an *Herbal Tea!* If you want something sour, you'll get a *Razz Berry
Tart!*

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Thank you... (Tesla +2)  
- I don't know what to say... (Neutral)  
- ... (Tesla -3)

Tesla will give you her *Yacht Keys.*

…. And that's about it for wholesome. After Amber interrupts, you'll be
taken into the hallway. Follow her into her room and talk to her.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Are you okay? (Neutral)  
- Stop being a child. (Amber -3)

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'm here to help. (Amber +2)

- Whats next? (Neutral)

Then, attempt to exit to the southeast. Team Xen invades again!

Battle your way through the grunts. The first grunt has a Shadow Mankey,
and the second has a Shadow Teddiursa.

Make sure you heal before heading outside. You'll be thrown into a
double battle.

Strangely, I recommend taking out Madelis first. Her Pokemon go down
easily to anything physical (Rock Slide, MVP as always) and Cradily
isn't much of a threat. Sharpedo can be really annoying with super
boosted Surf's if you let it get off Speed Boosts. The grunt's Heliolisk
can be particularly annoying with both of its field boosted moves and
since Ground moves do nothing here, but you should be alright with a bit
of planning and spread moves. Winning is not required but grants (Amber
+1 Relationship Points).

After a frustrating scene, you'll wake up in the house again.

Before we proceed, there are just a few things we can do right about now
that we should take care of, including our first non-Phione legendary
Pokemon!

Skip to the next section after this one if you want to progress the
story.

## River's End 2nd Visit -REnd2

Return to Rorim B, and from there, to Gearen City. The Poke Ball store
has added wares, yet again.

Poke Ball Emporium New Item (6 Badges)

*Friend Ball* $300

If you want to buy Friend Balls go ahead, they're not too useful though.

Take the bus to Goldenleaf. Surf south at Route 3 to return to River's
End.

Attempt to enter the house here for a cutscene. After talking to Matthew
Vasile, enter the train to the left. He wants us to do a quest for him
in the Wispy Tower ruins. He'll also give you the *Lab Key.*

Enter Wispy Tower, and talk to Sariah. She'll give us 3 *Ethers and*
start us on a quest for later on. Head down the stairs and make your way
to the upper left room. Surf north and use the key.

Talk to this tablet and you'll be engaged with a puzzle. Here is the
solution:

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image36.png"
style="width:6.66667in;height:5.03125in" />

Enter the pathway to the north, and you'll be taken back to Matthew's
lab. He needs us to retrieve a Magnet, a Poke Ball, and an Up-Grade.
Poke Balls can be obtained in stores, we've found two Up-Grades so far
(and potentially traded one away), and we were given a Magnet on Route 2
by showing a guy our Emolga.

Get the items in your bag, and return. The Pokemon inside will run off.
Buy some balls and return to the room in the Wispy Tower lab. You'll get
to battle **Type: Null!**

Exit, and add Null to your party. We're also going to want to evolve it
soon, so I recommend stocking up on friendship berries. Head back to
River's End and talk to Matthew at his house. Evolve it into
**Silvally** and head back to the Forsaken Laboratory, to the room where
you caught it. He'll give us the *Poison Memory!* We'll be finding the
rest as we continue in the game.

That's all there is for this quest - so head back to Teila Resort.

## Frozen Over Kristiline Town

To progress the story, enter the living room of Tesla's house. Talk to
Melia. Then board the boat.

Head west, and Melia and Venam will head towards the T.M. shop. The mart
and center are in the upper left area.

Kristiline Town Store

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Super Potion* $700

*Full Heal* $600

*Antidote* $100

*Ice Heal* $250

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Super Repel* $500

*Max Repel* $700

*Reverse Candy* $50

Enter the T.M. shop in the southeast. After a scene and a lesson with
Jenner, head up towards the Isle of Angels.

Cross the ice and enter the Church of Theolia.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yes. (Melia +1)  
- No. (Venam +1)

## Tower of Theolia

Grab the 2 *Yache Berries.*

Head up and heal and use the PC if you need. Head upstairs into the
Tower of Theolia!

Tower of Theolia

|             |          |
|-------------|----------|
| Cave | % |
| Bergmite    | 54       |
| Delibird    | 25       |
| Spheal      | 19       |
| **Swinub**  | 2        |

All of these can be gotten later, so don't worry if you don't want to or
can't get them now.

Grab *TM79 Frost Breath* on your way up 2F. Head up, battling the maid,
and seeing the scene on the stage. Head up into this next room.

Defeat these maids, and head into the next room.

After an outside portion, you'll meet Kreiss. It's your choice whether
to free him. If you do, you'll be rewarded with *TM101 Rock Climb!* Head
out to the top after this and follow doors through to the next cutscene.
Fight the two maids.

Now, there's a little bit of bonus story content we can get at this
point. Backtrack a few rooms, and curtains will be moved so that we can
access a new path. Head up to see the scene.

Return to where we were and enter the door. Continue through the path
and through the doors. After the cutscene at Teila, talk to Cera for
some advice, and heal. At the battlefield, head left to grab a *Hyper
Potion* and the top right for a *Max Revive.*

You can exit if need be but go ahead and prepare for the battle ahead!

## Glacier Badge

Gym Leader Angie (Icy Dimensional Field, Hail)

-   Jynx, Level 47. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Fake Out

    -   Cold Truth

    -   Psyshock

    -   Focus Blast

    -   Surf

    -   Cold Truth

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Stomping Tantrum

Cold Truth: Ice \| Special \| 95 power \| 100% accuracy \| Hits both
foes in a Double Battle \| Inflicts Torment on the target \| On Frozen
Dimensional Field, power is boosted x1.5 \| Turns Dimensional Field into
Frozen Dimensional Field.

If you managed to make it through the Novae battles, Valarie, and
Crawli, this is the first battle of the game you might really suffer.
Part of the problem is just how many things are stacked against you that
you must overcome - Icy Dimensional Field, which is difficult to change
and can be changed back with a single move, the hail which chips your
team down while powering up hers, that her team (even Crabominable with
its seed!) is exceptionally speedy, they like to set up Aurora Veil, so
you need to break it. Trick Room if you can find it, Drought/Sunny Day
and a way to change the field (Heat Wave, Flame Burst, Lava Plume may be
your only options) are decent ways to build yourself an advantage. You
can also take advantage of the field yourself, as Ice and Dark moves are
buffed.

The scene at this point splits a lot and depends on whether you saved
Kreiss. If you did, it's straightforward - he'll freeze Angie, and you
can exit into a melted Kristiline Town. Here, Kreiss will give you the
Glacier Badge!

If you didn't save him, head into 5F, and you'll be taken onto the long
staircase. Head all the way down, and Valarie will save the day. Here
you'll get the Glacier Badge, and Kreiss will now give you the T.M. for
Rock Climb if you didn't save him earlier.

The Glacier Badge lets us Rock Climb and gives up to Level 55 Pokemon.

Head outside the church if you didn't save Kreiss. Regardless of your
choice, you'll be given a choice to fast travel back to Teila. We're
gonna do some stuff here in Kristiline, so I recommend not accepting the
offer.

# Chapter 8: Those We Lose

## Kristiline Town

Back inside the church, you'll find:

ZCell 036: Church of Theolia

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image37.png"
style="width:6.07083in;height:4.32917in" />

Outside, pick up *TM07 Hail.* On the beach below there is a hidden
*Icicle Plate.*

Surf down at the Isle of Angels.

Isle of Angels (Grassy Terrain)

The big island to the south hides a *Magical Seed, Ice Gem, Max Repel.*
If you have 10 Occa Berries to trade, the fisherman here will trade you
a *Deepseatooth* or a *Deepseascale.* We already have one of each,
though.

A smaller island contains a hidden *Dive Ball,* another has a *Rock
Gem.* Grab the *Shed Shell* on another island.

Reenter the town.

Pop, Green Shard, Red Shard.* In the house on the northeast, take the
other door to get:

ZCell 037: Kristiline Town

Cross the bridge to the south part of Kristiline. Inside a building is
another guy in the virtual badge quest!

Gym Leader Pryce (Glitch Field)

-   Sneasel, Level 44.

    -   Metal Claw

    -   Strength

    -   Beat Up

    -   Ice Beam

-   Cloyster, Level 44.

    -   Surf

    -   Icicle Spear

    -   Spikes

    -   Explosion

-   Dewgong, Level 43.

    -   Rest

    -   Dive

    -   Toxic

    -   Lovely Kiss

    -   Psychic

    -   Ice Beam

    -   Nasty Plot

-   Piloswine, Level 46. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Stomping Tantrum

    -   Blizzard

    -   Amnesia

    -   Rock Tomb

Pryce is an easy fight with the Cyndaquil route - Typhlosion and Jolteon
will do most of the work: use Miltank to wall, Qwilfish to get up entry
hazards and if you can make sure Jolteon prevents Dewgong from setting
up its defenses and its special attack with Stockpile thanks to the
field you should be set. Get the seventh *Virtual Badge!*

Gym Leader Clair (Glitch Field)

-   Dragonair, Level 51.

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Dragonbreath

    -   Double Team

    -   Ice Beam

-   Ampharos, Level 51.

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Confuse Ray

    -   Thunderbolt

-   Rhydon, Level 53. @ Passho Berry.

    -   Earthquake

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Strength

    -   Swords Dance

-   Gyarados, Level 53. @ Wacan Berry.

    -   Double Edge

    -   Surf

    -   Bounce

    -   Dragon Dance

-   Dragonair, Level 54. @ Yache Berry.

    -   Draco Meteor

    -   Hydro Pump

    -   Agility

    -   Focus Energy

-   Kingdra, Level 55. @ Scope Lens.

    -   Draco Meteor

    -   Hydro Pump

    -   Agility

    -   Focus Energy

Next up is Clair. I thought this one was easy actually: Jolteon with
Wish and Hidden Power Ice easily takes both Dragonair and Ampharos, as
well as Gyarados if you can weaken it a bit first. Letting Gligar take
out Rhydon and cripple Gyarados with Jolteon taking care of the dragons
left only Kingdra, who can easily be taken down by Miltank and Qwilfish!
Win for your eighth *Virtual Badge!* Garret will also then give you 25
AP points!

Talk to the other guy in this house. Give the Aquamarine Ore to the guy
for a *Prism Scale!*

Enter the museum for $500 and talk to the director. He will send us on a
quest to Goldenleaf Town, so we'll take care of that as soon as we
return.

To proceed the story a bit, head into Amber's room and talk to the crew.
We must return to the Sapphire Museum in Kristiline Town. If you
retrieved the painter, now you can choose a sculpture and get paid
$10000. There is a *Cherish Ball* in the trash to the right.

Head upstairs and read about Regice.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Yes. (Aelita +2)

    -   X-Scissor

    -   Drain Punch

    -   Bounce

    -   Swords Dance

-   Blaziken, Level 51. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Brave Bird

    -   Protect

    -   Sky Uppercut

    -   Blaze Kick

-   Staraptor, Level 51. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Brave Bird

    -   Close Combat

    -   U-Turn

    -   Take Down

Her team focuses on a lot of fast, hard hitting Pokemon that can U-Turn
out if need be. They're all frail bar Gliscor though, so if you have the
bulk to survive hits across your team, you can take them out. Not a
noteworthy fight after Angie, to be honest.

To continue the story, skip ahead a few sections to Carotos, Pt 2.
Otherwise there's tons of optional content that is now open to us!

Head into the help center - it's time for some Help Center Quests!

## Kristiline Help Center Requests

We'll be exploring some new areas with Rock Climb throughout these
quests, so I recommend reading to at least check what new areas you can
explore. If you haven't yet gotten it, the Golden Claws from the AP
center are useful here!

HQuest 18: Lighthouse

-   Talk to the ranger on the boat dock of Kristiline Town to get the
    *Lighthouse Key*.

-   Take the ranger teleporter to Terajuma Shore, and surf around to the
    lighthouse. Enter, and go up.

-   Read the note, and remember the code ends in 67.

-   Head all the way north to Route 5 and enter this lighthouse.

-   Read the note, and remember the code starts with 98.

-   Enter Aquamarine Cave from the west, and head into the cave with the
    big door. Rock Climb up to get *TM20 Safeguard*!

-   Go to where Amber fell into a hole. Jump down, and surf to the
    right. Rock climb up here.

-   Hidden up here is *Green Shard, Rock Gem, Blue Shard.* There is also
    a visible *Sea Incense* at the top, and a *Link Heart* towards the
    center at the bottom.

-   Make your way to the ladder in this area and go up. *Fresh Water*,
    *Water Gem*, *Dive Ball* are hidden here. Exit this room at the top
    to reach the Secluded Shore. Talk to Dylan, then head up. Here
    you'll find Poliwag \#6!

-   Enter this lighthouse and go up. Read the note to learn that the
    Ampharos are in Jirukala Cavern!

-   Exit, and head up. We can explore this new bit of Route 6 if we
    want. Here you'll find Kingler and Hoppip, but also:

ZCell 039: Route 6

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image40.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.03125in" />

-   Add something to your party with Headbutt, and return to the area
    above where we fought Valarie in Terajuma Jungle. Enter Jirukala
    Cavern here, and rock climb up.

-   In the trees here, you can headbutt! You have an 11% chance each to
    get 3 *Oran, Sitrus, and Leppa Berries*, but also an 11% chance to
    get **Greedent**, 22% chance to get Skwovet, and 33% chance to get
    **Applin**!

-   Pick up *Green Shard,* then, on the right, grab *Modest Mint* and
    *TM131 Bullet Seed* then head down.

-   Enter the password 9867 into the door.

-   Beat the grunts, then the ranger will take the Ampharos back.

-   Pick up:

ZCell 040: Jirukala Cavern

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image41.PNG"
style="width:6.54167in;height:4.91139in" />

-   Completing this quest also gives us access to some stationary water
    Pokemon for GourmetTreats - but only at night. Head to Terajuma
    Shore to get **Staryu,** to Route 6 to get **Clamperl,** and Route 5
    to get **Slowpoke.**

-   While we're up on Route 5, Rock Climb here to get a *Adamant Mint,*
    and access to Jeminra Cave but without the need for Safari Balls.
    Grab the *TM144 Cross Poison* inside.

-   Rock Smash one of the rocks here, and use Purify in the battle. Any
    Pyukumuku we've found so far should have it. Then, exit the cave and
    re-enter through the Safari Zone. Surf through the cave. Chase
    **Wimpod** into the bottom left corner for a battle!

-   Return to the help center to get: $6245, *Revival Herb,* and
    **Mareep.** (+1 Karma)

HQuest 19: Take my Quiz!

-   Head outside and enter the house in the top right of town. Talk to
    the guy here.

-   The answers to his quiz are: 4, Calmness, and 5.

-   After...that… head back to the help center to get $10000. (+1
    Karma)

HQuest 20: Defend Me!

-   Head into Aquamarine Cave, and head to the large open basement room.

-   Head west from where Amber's bed was, then surf to the west side of
    the room.

-   Beat all the AA grunts in here.

-   Return to the help center to get $4000 and *Mystic Water.*

HQuest 21: Research

-   Head outside and talk with Dr. Jenkel. We must find and talk to 7
    people all around the island.

-   First, enter the house directly to the left of the dock bridge in
    Kristiline. Talk to the old lady.

-   Second, enter the Kristiline Pokemart, and talk to the girl in the
    aisles.

-   Third, enter the south middle villa in Teila Resort, and talk to the
    lady on the left side.

-   Fourth, talk to the hiker hiding behind the south left villa in
    Teila Resort.

While you're in Teila, notice that there is a new Move Tutor on the east
side:

Teila Resort Move Tutor

Aqua Tail 4 Blue Shards

Magic Coat 4 Blue Shards

Electroweb 4 Blue Shards

-   Fifth, enter the construction hut in Terajuma Jungle and talk to the
    guy on the couch.

-   Sixth and Seventh, talk to the people in the middle house in the row
    in Kakori village

-   Then, head outside… After getting teleported, claim your rewards:
    *Exp. Candy L* and *Up-Grade.* (+1 Karma)

HQuest 22: ???

-   Take a teleporter to Terajuma Shore. Surf up to the left of the
    shoreline, towards the strange house. Talk to Jenkel, then enter.

-   Defeat the first few trainers, then grab the *Data Drive.*

-   Head up, and you'll have to battle 6 Inkay ranging from Level 50
    to 90. Really, if you don't let the 80/90 ones set up on you with
    Superpower, you'll be able to come out ahead.

-   As a result, we now have access to the move relearner in Sheridan
    Village! Talk to the sister for a free *Heart Scale.*

-   Now that we have the Data Drive, take the teleporter to return to
    Ranger HQ, and go into the hallway room 2nd from the right.

-   Head up twice and interact with the upper left computer to battle
    Porygon!

-   Return to the Kristiline Help Center to get your reward: **Inkay!**
    (+1 Karma)

For completing all five, you will be gifted **Eevee!** (+1 Karma)

## Floria Island Rock Climb

That's about all we can do on Terajuma Island alone, far as side quests
are concerned. The boat can take us all sorts of places, including
Gearen, Akuwa, and Secret Shore. Anyways, first, we're going to go to
the Secret Shore. Again, this is optional, so skip ahead if you want.

Enter Xen Lab again and take the teleporter here to get to the back
room. Enter the cave. Surf to the right to find a hidden *Link Heart.*
Then, head back to use Rock Climb. Enter the cave up here to get *TM81
X-Scissor!* There's also an *Up-Grade* in the bookshelf.

Leave the swamp and return to Gearen Help Center. Now that we've found
35 Zygarde cells, Mei and Ayuda will give us the *Soothe Bell!* This can
cut down on the number of friendships berries we need to use from now
on. Our next target is 45.

Enter the Magnolia library and talk to Zumi again. Now that we have
Mareep, we will be given an **Aevian Mareep** as well at 6 *Exp. Candy
M.* Our next quest is for Toxel.

Remember that impossible fight in the Aqua Building? Well, I was able to
beat it at this point, so why not give it a shot. Not essential to get
done now, but if you can, why not.

Challenger Mercury (No Field)

-   Abra, Level 10. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Light Screen

    -   Thunderwave

    -   Trick Room

    -   Reflect

-   Kadabra, Level 45. @ Red Card.

    -   Psychic

    -   Energy Ball

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Calm Mind

-   Alakazam, Level 85. @ Twistedspoon.

    -   Psychic

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Toxic

    -   Recover

You could use the Kadabra and Abra to set up a sweeper, or just use
something that can live Alakazam's two attacks and hit hard. A Shedinja
can also work - let it get paralyzed by Abra, then Alakazam can't touch
it, though Kadabra can. If you win against her, you can get *Star Shard
2.*

I recommend taking another trip to the AP shop. If you haven't gotten
the Exp. All or the Golden Axe, Hammer, Surfboard, and Claws, do so
ASAP. On deck will be the Golden Driftboard and the Golden Gauntlet.

Head to Sheridan Village, and enter Route 3. Using Flash if you want,
head back to the Poliwag area of Phasial Cave. Now that we've found all
six, we can catch **Poliwag!**

Head back out and into Goldenleaf Town. Enter Narcissa's Gym and talk to
the guy at the front. Make your way all the way back through Backstage
Theatre and enter the mirror.

Enter this door at the top, then interact with the painting up here.
Follow Mew out of the room, through the mirror to get the *Odd Key,* and
to the Lost Castle.

Here, we're going to want to read all the books and keep track of all
the numbers. Head up the stairs and talk to Dusclops, and enter the
following: 0044, 6677, 3645, 9043, 7171. Enter the next room and get
ready for a series of battles. It's a gauntlet of 3, but nearly
everything that is used is ghost, psychic, and/or dark type, so you
should be able to take them out with ease with the right coverage.
Shatter the bubble.

Return to town and enter the eastern house. Talk to the guy and send him
to Kristiline Town. Then, enter Wispy Ruins through the Wispy Tower area
entrance. Climb the rocks and head down the ivy into Wispy Chasm.

Head all the way down, picking up hidden *Dark Gem* as you go. Around
the bottom is the 6-badge gate. Open the chest inside to get
**Scraggy!**

In the chasm room, head towards the middle then go down to get a *Rare
Candy* and *TM65 Shadow Claw.* Surf across up above to get to the
3-badge gate. Open the chest to get a *Shiny Stone*.

Head back up the ivy, enter the room on the right, and go back down.
There is a hidden *Yellow Shard, Ghost Gem,* and *Reverse Candy* Grab
the *Poke Doll* when you go down. Surf to the south to get to the
7-badge gate. Open the chest to get an *Odd Keystone.*

Exit the ruins and make your way back to Akuwa Town. Enter Evergreen
Forest and climb the rocks to get an *Icy Rock*.

## Amethyst Cave 2<sup>nd</sup> Visit

Head to Route 2 and enter Amethyst Cave. Start by going to the room up
from the first, where there is water and where we got a cell and
activated a panel once upon a time. Head down from the panel and rock
climb to get *TM01 Work Up.*

Next, enter the room to the right of this one, and rock climb down next
to the waterfall. Talk to April, then activate Panel 3 to the right.
Grab the hidden *Rock Gem, Steel Gem,* and *Water Gem.* Head down from
here and talk to April again.

ZCell 041: Amethyst Cave

style="width:6.17708in;height:4.68439in" />

Return to the entrance of the cave from Route 2. Take the stairs to the
right, then head across the first bridge on top. Rock climb here, pick
up the hidden *Zinc,* and head in.

Amethyst Cave (Rock Climb Areas)

Exit on the bottom doors to the left to meet Alisha, the ninth and final
*lost kid* for the Lost Camp! There is a hidden *Carbos* here.

Back up from here, grab the *Elixir* and enter the cave on the left.

Security Drone Regirock (Crystal Cavern Field)

-   Regirock, Level 60. @ Lum Berry. 2 Shields.

    -   Stone Edge

    -   Rest

    -   Curse

    -   Earthquake

Not impossible if you can lower its attack with a burn or something
similar!

Activate Panel 4, then head to the upper right door and enter for a
similar battle!

Security Drone Registeel (Crystal Cavern Field)

-   Registeel, Level 60. @ Lum Berry. 2 Shields.

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Rest

    -   Curse

    -   Iron Head

Grab the *Moon Dial* and activate Panel 5 here, then head down the
ladder on the left. Grab hidden *Rock Gem, Super Repel, Ether,*

Talk to the ex-Xen Grunt in the open area. Head down the ladder here and
activate Panel 6 on the right.

Head down and rock climb down from here. We're gonna need to smash the
crystals in this new area somehow: the wild Geodude have Magnitude and
can do it, alternatively, if you have the Bulldoze T.M. then you can use
that. Once you succeed, head down to the bottom of this area and
interact with this crystal for a chance to catch **Aevian Lapras!**

With all six panels activated, head back to the Xen grunt and activate
the machine. The Xen guy will head up, so grab the hidden *PP Up* and
climb the ladder. Grab the Rift Notes and prepare yourself.

Talk to the Grunt and save in front of the statue. Talk to the grunt
again, and you'll have to fight:

Lingering Regret Nancy (Mountain Field)

-   Whimsicott, Level 51. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Moonblast

    -   Hurricane

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Tailwind

-   Mr. Mime, Level 53. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Hidden Power Fairy

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Psychic

    -   Icy Wind

-   Galarian Weezing, Level 52. @ Black Sludge.

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Strange Steam

-   Gardevoir, Level 53. @ Babiri Berry.

    -   Psychic

    -   Moonblast

    -   Mystical Fire

    -   Calm Mind

-   Sylveon, Level 55. @ Leftovers.

    -   Psyshock

    -   Calm Mind

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Hyper Voice

This is an easy team to beat if you were able to beat Angie! It doesn't
really have a ton of good answers for a solid Steel / Poison move core.

Dimensional Rift Chandelure (Mountain Field)

-   Chandelure, Level 58. @ Demon Stone. 1 Shield. Stats:
    110/25/69/200/110/100

    -   Power Gem

    -   Ominous Wind

    -   Icy Wind

    -   Heat Wave

This thing has Protean, so if you can swap its type away from fire, it
will actively take damage from the field. A team of six that can survive
its attacks can wear it down easily, especially if any of your mons have
a lot of Sp. Def. With its 100 base speed, it will outspeed most of your
Pokemon, so Trick Room trivializes this fight.

Exit at the top and talk to Manny. He'll give you a *Shiny Stone.*
Hidden around is a *Rare Candy, Elixir, Iron.*

At night, you'll find:

ZCell 042: Cliffside Grave (Night ONLY)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image43.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.02083in" />

Interact with the grave at the top and insert the Cursed Candle we got a
while ago to obtain **Litwick!**

Return to the basement level to talk to April. She'll give us the *Phase
Dial!* Head in and go up.

Chaotic Fusion Solrock (Crystal Cavern Field)

-   Fused Solrock, Level 50, 2 Shields.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Zen Headbutt

    -   Cosmic Power

    -   Solar Flare

It's easy with a good super effective move! Now you can use the Phase
Dial to fuse your own Solrock and Lunatone.

That's all we can do in this area for now.

## Lost Camp Pt. 2

Now, we should have found all nine kids. Ctrl + F the phrase “lost kid”
in the guide to get any that you missed. So, head back to Route 4, and
enter the lost camp.

Donate the last $7500 to Maman. After a scene, head back outside and
take the truck to Sheridan Village.

## Carotos Mountain 2nd Visit

Head up to Sheridan Arena and head up to the house formerly belonging to
Keta.

Talk to Texen in the lower room, then choose your team of three in the
upper room for a battle.

-   Infernape, Level 53. @ Charcoal.

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Thunderpunch

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Mach Punch

Luckily Aelita's team is pretty good here: Quick Guard support and
Reflect will basically guarantee you a win. Win and head into Carotos
Mountain. Talk to Aelita at the HQ, then head down right to the
elevator. Head over to fight SEC for the last time and catch his Shadow
Slakoth.

Corrupted Cave (Corrupted Cave Field / Murkwater Surface)

|                  |          |
|------------------|----------|
| Cave      | % |

| **Muk (Alolan)** | 9        |
| **Torkoal**      | 1        |

You'll also find **Alolan Grimer** and **Garbodor** walking around in
certain parts. Aelita will join us!

Hidden in the first map is a *Poison Gem* and 2 *Super Repels*. Follow
the path down and to the left. Talk to the maids, and defeat Deborah.

After this scene, follow Aelita into the room to the left, then climb
the vines to enter the room to the right. Observe the position of the
blocks.

Set the blocks in the left room into this position, then enter the door.
Enter the newly revealed room and enter

Ancient Kingdra (Blessed Field)

-   Kingdra, Level 55. @ Dragon Fang.

    -   Origin Pulse

    -   Dragon Pulse

    -   Luster Purge

    -   Ice Beam / Aura Sphere / Mystical Fire (Random)

Luckily, not too bad. If you beat the one in the ancient forest you can
do this one. Lowering its special attack can be key. If one of the
randomly generated final moves counters your team you can reset for a
different one.

Enter this next room. Across this bridge is the alignment we need to set
these blocks into. A solution (thanks Elucidative!):

- Pangoro left all the way, down all the way, right 2, up 2, right 3,
up 3  
- Zorua left all the way, down all the way, right 2, down all the way,
right 3, down 3  
- Apple right 4, up 2, right 3  
- Chimecho right all the way (it'll be stopped by the Zorua), up all the
way, right all the way, up 2, left all the way  
- Zorua left 1  
- Budew left all the way (it'll be stopped by the Zorua), up 3, right
all the way  
- Zorua right 1, up 3

Head east and battle Esther, then take out another Kingdra. Enter the
door to the right. Head down the stairs, then out the bottom. Follow the
path to get *TM86 Grass Knot.*

Head down the stairs to the west for an optional challenge.

- Pink Shellos left, down all the way, left all the way, down 5, left,
down all the way, right, down all the way  
- Starly up 1, right all the way, down 1, right 2, down 6, left, down
all the way, left (it'll be stopped by the Apple), down all the way,
left 1  
- Apple right 1, up, right 1, up 7, right, up 7, left all the way, down
5, right 1  
- Omanyte right 1, up 3, right, up 7, left 3, up 1  
- Lopunny up, right, up all the way, left, up 3, left 7, up all the way,
right 1, up 7, right, up 7, right 4, up, right, up  
- Shinx left 2, up all the way, right, up all the way, left, up 3, left
9, up 5, right 1   
- Pink Shellos right 5, down all the way, right, down all the way, left,
down 3, right all the way, up 2

left all the way (it'll be stopped by Darkrai), down 5, left 3, up  
- Darkrai right 6, up all the way, right all the way, down all the way

Up from here in the newly opened area, you can touch a statue to fight
**Zorua!**

Then, head back up and take note of each of statue placement - we're
going to need to move each into that spot upstairs yet again. The
solution:

- Omanyte right all the way, down all the way, left 1, down 4, right 7,
up 3  
- Zorua down 1, right 2  
- Pangoro down 8, left 4, up  
- Starly right 2, down 2  
- Zorua left 1, down 1, right 1, down all the way (it'll be stopped by
Aelita), left 7, up all the way  
- Starly right 1, up, right all the way, up all the way, left 2, up 8,
right all the way, down 2  
- Chingling up, left 3, up 8, left all the way, down, left 2  
- Darkrai right all the way, up all the way, left 2, up 8, left 1  
- Apple down 1, left all the way (it'll be stopped by Darkrai), down all
the way  
- Darkrai right

Enter the newly opened area at the top.

There are encounters here in the water.

Deborah will mock you here but tell her “from the start” to progress.

We'll end up back in Sheridan. Head into the village proper and talk to
Aelita to progress.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- But why? (Aelita +1)  
- A good decision. (Aelita -2)

Accept the fast travel, step on the pad, and enter the left room. Exit
the room and surf across to the right and go all the way down the vines
and out. Itemfinder around here to get a Moon Stone! Step on the pad,
then go up. Head up to the battlefield.

Angie's Right Hand Man Cera (Corrupted Cave)

-   Groudon, Level 57. @ Lum Berry.

    -   Precipice Blades

    -   Rest

    -   Lava Plume

    -   Solarbeam

Luckily, because of the field, Groudon will get Poisoned. If you can
deal just enough damage for it to get knocked out here, you'll be fine.

You'll then get the *Magma Stone but* be presented with a choice. It is
up to you what to choose: the story will split here a bit. Choosing
“Keep It” grants (+1 Karma). Jump to the section corresponding to your
choice.

## Valor Mountain

### Entering the Mountain (Kept It Route)

Head back to the room Aelita was in, then follow Tommen out. After a
brief cutscene, you'll be back in Sheridan.

Make your way to unfreeze the T.M. shop in Kristiline. You'll be given
*TM110 Magma Drift!*

Head back into the shop, and they'll have wares:

Kristiline T.M. Shop (\<12 Badges)

*RM02 Avalanche* $50000

*RM03 Zap Cannon* $50000

*RM04 Metronome* $25000

*RM06 Retaliate* $25000

*RM07 Dynamic Punch* $50000

*RM08 Vacuum Wave* $25000

*RM09 Tri Attack* $25000

*TM141 Fire Fang* $20000

*TM142 Thunder Fang* $20000

*TM143 Psycho Cut* $70000

Buy these if you'd like!

Return to Teila Resort, and enter Tesla's Villa. Head upstairs and talk
to Valarie and Venam.

Head to Valor Shore, and drift across the lava and enter. Get the
*Emotion Powder* as you walk in.

Head to the upper left and go up the ladder. Beat the Xen scientist here
and activate the Fire Source Crystal! Then, take the ladder here at the
bottom. Activate the Ice Crystal here.

Head down the left ladder from the entrance, and notice that the Chamber
of Awakening at the top is now open.

We get to choose whether or not we are going to save Amber. You don't
have to, but if you choose not to, characters will hate you and you will
not get the karma. If you choose to do so, read the saving Amber section
below. If not, skip ahead to the convergence section.

### Saving Amber (Kept It Route)

Enter the chamber, and head up and stand in the circle for another
titanic battle!

Kyogre (Water Surface Field)

-   Kyogre, Level 60.

    -   Muddy Water

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Ice Beam

This is a bit harder than Groudon since the field really helps it,
rather than hurts it. Long story short, its Muddy Water boosted by rain
and water surface will decimate your entire team. And it has 3 shields.
If you have anything with Thunder, it hits 100% of the time and may be
the best tool you have to take it out. I managed to win this thing on my
Fire Monotype, so I'm sure you will eventually find a way.

After winning, Madelis will give you the *HQ Railnet Key*.

### Entering the Mountain (Gave It Away Route)

Head back to the room Aelita was in, then follow Tommen out. After a
brief cutscene, you'll be back in Sheridan.

Return to Teila Resort, and enter Tesla's Villa. Head upstairs and talk
to Valarie and Venam. Accept the fast travel. Head all the way up. After
a conversation, enter the door.

Talk to Venam up from here. Then, head up the ladder to 1F and head
right. You'll get the *Emotion Powder.*

Head to the upper left and go up the ladder. Beat the Xen scientist here
and activate the Fire Source Crystal! Then, take the ladder here at the
bottom. Activate the Ice Crystal here.

Head down the left ladder from the entrance, and you'll notice the
Chamber of Awakening is now open. and enter the Chamber of Awakening at
the top that is now open. Talk with Venam here then head up.

We get to choose whether or not we are going to save Amber. You don't
have to, but if you choose not to, characters will hate you and you will
not get the karma. If you choose to do so, read the saving Amber section
below. If not, skip ahead to the convergence section.

### Saving Amber (Gave It Away Route)

Enter the chamber and talk to Venam. Then head up from here and stand in
the circle for another titanic battle!

Kyogre (Water Surface Field)

-   Kyogre, Level 60.

    -   Muddy Water

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Ice Beam

Luckily in this route, Venam helps us defeat Kyogre. The field really
helps it, rather than hurts it. Long story short, its Muddy Water
boosted by rain and water surface will decimate your entire team. And it
has 3 shields. If you have anything with Thunder, it hits 100% of the
time and may be the best tool you have to take it out. I managed to win
this thing on my Fire Monotype, so I'm sure you will eventually find a
way.

After winning, Madelis will give you the *HQ Railnet Key*.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Don't wait till it's too late. (Venam +2)  
- Be kind to her. (venam +1)  
- ... (Venam -2)

### Scaling Mt. Valor (Both Routes Converge)

So now the routes essentially converge, so I will cover all the Pokemon
and items we can get in the mountain as we scale it. Even if you choose
not to fight Kyogre and save Amber, there is a Zygarde cell you can get
by entering the Chamber of Awakening.

Return to the first floor. Each mood of the mountain has different
encounters we can fight.

| Bergmite                   | 1        |

While the cave is Icy, pick up the *Revive* at the bottom left, as well
as the *Ice Heal* and hidden *Water Stone* in the bottom right of the
snow. *TM132 Icicle Spear* is at the top right of this area as well.

Head up at the top of this area and enter the base. Go upstairs, grab
*Blunder Policy* and *Metal Powder,* and push the switch in the top
right corner. Pressing the switch next to Reina grants (+3 Reina
Relationship Points). Back downstairs, try to leave through the top and
you'll get teased again. Try to leave through the bottom.

After… something… Saki gives you a *Revive* if you kept the Magma Stone,
but if not, you'll finally get the T.M. for Magma Drift!

Head up through the newly destroyed door. Go up and activate the Neutral
Source Crystal!

You can also get **Heracross** if you go down and through the barricade.

Head all the way up from here, pick up the *Hyper Potion,* and go up the
ladder. Loop your way around to the left. Grab *TM147 Tail Slap* hiding
behind the Ice Source Crystal, then activate it. To the left, you'll
find:

ZCell 045: Valor Mountain (Ice)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image46.PNG"
style="width:6.91667in;height:5.17256in" />

Make your way around and up. Activate the fire crystal at the top here.

Head down and right, then drift across to find **Vulpix!** Give it a
GourmetTreat for a battle.

By clicking each crystal in succession, make your way to the top of the
room. Back at the top of the room, fall down the hole to the left.
You'll find:

ZCell 046: Valor Mountain (Ice)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image47.png"
style="width:6.72396in;height:5.01001in" />

Fall down the hole again, then proceed all the way through the barricade
and back up the mountain. This time, take the ladder at the top.

Exit to the Valor Cliffside. Pick up hidden *HP Up* and *Blast Powder.*
On the Gave It Away Route, if you ignored saving Amber, now you will get
(-2 Venam Relationship Points).

ZCell 047: Valor Cliffside

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image48.png"
style="width:6.70313in;height:5.13906in" />

Head down from here.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You're cruel. (Venam +3)

- ... (Neutral)

- She deserved it. (Venam -4)

Head up and into the next room. Grab *TM134 Rock Blast.*

Relationship Point Choices:
- We can do this together! (Melia +3, Venam +3)

- Sorta like that, yeah. (Melia +1, Venam +1)

- Team Xen is all I care about. (Melia -2, Venam -2)

Activate the fire crystal here, then return to the main dungeon through
the cliffside. On the right side, you'll find:

ZCell 048: Valor Mountain (Fire)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image49.png"
style="width:6.625in;height:4.99943in" />

Head down and go to the left. Drift across then jump in the hole twice.

ZCell 049: Valor Mountain (Fire)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image50.png"
style="width:6.61458in;height:5.1053in" />

Also, talk to Heatmor with a GourmetTreat for a chance to catch it.

Next, head up at the top of this room to reenter the blockade. Upstairs
the rightmost door will be open now, head outside and feed **Tepig** a
bunch of GourmetTreats for a chance to battle it.

Head back to the cliffside and enter the room beyond. Interact with the
neutral crystal, then head back into the dungeon via the cliffside once
more. On the left, surf and fall down the hole. Pick up a hidden *Rare
Candy,* then fall down the other hole and grab the *Leaf Stone* at the
bottom!

Jump down the ledge, and head up the ladder here. On the right:

ZCell 050: Valor Mountain (Normal)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image51.PNG"
style="width:6.96354in;height:5.24314in"
alt="A picture containing indoor, decorated, several Description automatically generated" />

Head back down the ladder, activate the ice crystal, then enter the
teleporter at the bottom of this map.

Head all the way back up to the top and enter the summit.

## Valor Summit

Grab the *Dragon Scale* on the left of the summit.

Head up to the top when you're ready. The first battle:

Renegade Giratina (Volcano Top Field)

-   Giratina, Level 60. @ Griseous Orb.

    -   Shadow Force

    -   Earth Power

    -   Dragon Pulse

    -   Magma Drift

If you have Blizzard it can help a ton with this fight. Volcanic Top -\>
Mountain -\> Snowy Mountain across two blizzards, but back to Volcanic
Top after it uses Magma Drift. You can also consider paralyzing and
poisoning it if necessary. Ultimately this isn't that bad of a fight if
you have a decent strategy.

Heal, and follow the action to the top. Time for a double battle with
Melia.

Team Xen Geara and Zetta (Volcano Top Field)

-   Krookodile, Level 53. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Earthquake

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Crunch

    -   Low Kick

-   Grimmsnarl, Level 53. @ Light Clay.

    -   False Surrender

    -   Spirit Break

    -   Reflect

    -   Light Screen

-   Gyarados, Level 54. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Iron Head

    -   Waterfall

    -   Earthquake

    -   Stone Edge

-   Clefable, Level 55. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Thunder

    -   Moonblast

    -   Flamethrower

-   Marowak (Alolan), Level 53. @ Thick Club.

    -   Bonemerang

    -   Shadow Bone

    -   Low Kick

    -   Fire Punch

-   Gengar, Level 55. @ Life Orb.

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Will-O-Wisp

    -   Focus Blast

-   Minior, Level 53. @ Telluric Seed.

    -   Shell Smash

    -   Acrobatics

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Earthquake

-   Weavile, Level 53. @ Razor Claw.

    -   Poison Jab

    -   Brick Break

    -   Night Slash

    -   Fake Out

-   Absol, Level 53. @ Scope Lens.

    -   Stone Edge

    -   Sucker Punch

    -   Night Slash

    -   Brick Break

-   Typhlosion, Level 55. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Eruption

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Focus Blast

    -   Hidden Power Grass

-   Dragonite, Level 54. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Brick Break

    -   Dragon Claw

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Thunder Punch

-   Silvally, Level 55. @ Ground Memory.

    -   Multi-Attack

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Thunder

This battle is insane, but at least a fitting final Xen boss to Act 1 of
Pokemon Rejuvenation! Zetta's Typhlosion is intense, as it's fast and
its Eruption is strong. Grimmsnarl also gets basically at least 1 free
screen unless you have Brick Break to remove it, so that is also tough
to deal with. Their aces, Gengar and Silvally respectively, are also
insanely fast and can kill most of your Pokemon. Worst of all about half
of Melia's team kind of sucks and isn't really that helpful in this
fight!

The Volcano Top field can be used to your advantage: consider using your
own Fire moves to take advantage of it. You can also transition to Sky
Field with Bounce or to Volcanic Field with Dig, both of which you may
be able to get a better footing in. Regardless of the field effect, the
key is making sure that you have the right pairings at any given time,
so Melia's Pokemon don't get one-shotted. Unfortunately, this means a
LOT of trial and error with the AI, but eventually you'll be able to
find the exact chinks in Zetta and Geara's armor and can take them out.

In the beach area, follow the path.

Afterwards, return to the top of the mountain, collecting the souls as
you go. You'll be thrust into a battle with Geara and Zetta again, but
all their Pokemon are at 1HP and you are supposed to easily win.

Make your way to the bridge in Terajuma Jungle and approach Melia.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Yes. (Melia +2)  
- No. (Neutral)

Talk to Crescent.

Now, the next destination is the gym battle. If you want to progress,
skip the next section.

## Post-Valor Quests

We can pick up a few Pokemon and items! Head to Ranger HQ in Kakori.
Talk to Crawli at the entrance for ZCrystal *Buginium-Z.* We can't use
it yet, though.

First, if you didn't save Amber, enter the Chamber of Awakening in Valor
mountain, where you'll find the *HQ Railnet Key.*

Next, if you went down the Gave It Away Route, the T.M. Store in
Kristiline is now open. The list of T.M.'s they sell is in the top of
the previous section.

The people of Akuwa Town have… FINALLY been returned to their home, so
head to Akuwa Town.

The girl in the top right running in place can teach you some moves:

Akuwa Town Outdoor Move Tutor

Grass Pledge 3 Green Shards

Fire Pledge 3 Red Shards

Enter the ACDMC in the upper right. At the top left corner, you can
trade in 10 of each color shard for the *Sail Fossil, Jaw Fossil, Skull
Fossil,* and *Armor Fossil.* At the top right counter, you can revive

Head to any shop that sells regular Poke Balls and make sure you have
one in your bag. Now that we have Madelis' key, take the boat over to
Secret Shore. Head to the southwestern most island, and rock climb. Here
begins a quest for two Hoenn Pokemon.

1.  Talk to Mudkip on the southwest island (requires Rock Climb/Cut)

2.  Talk to Mudkip on the southern middle island

3.  Talk to Mudkip on the center right island (requires Cut)

4.  Head to the back room of Xen Shadow HQ. Use Madelis' key to take the

    Batteries, and Poke Ball to obtain **Ralts!**

6.  Exit out the door at the bottom, then head down to Mudkip. While
    you're here, pick up a *Damp Rock* and a *Fighting Memory,* and a
    hidden *Star Piece* to the south.

7.  Surf up from here, and enter Xen Lab from its left side. The door is
    sorta hard to see. Then exit to the south. Surf across and to the
    right, and you can battle/catch **Mudkip!**

We also now have Magma Drift, so there are a few places we can go. Buy a
Spice Powder from the jungle if you don't have one yet, and head to
Sheridan, enter Carotos. Rock Smash the rock to the left and drift to
the left. Grab *TM36 Sludge Bomb!* Head back to the right and drift
across here. Clear this maze and grab the *Rare Candy* as well as the
**Cyndaquil** egg.

Enter the next room and make your way to Madelis' palace. Head down to
the corrupted cave area. Magma Drift here and follow the path to a
*Poison Barb.* Back on land, continue following the path to the
southeast and you'll find another spot to Magma Drift on the right.
Hidden along it is another *Poison Barb.* Follow the path to catch
**Aevian Paras!**

This is all we can do for now, so when you're ready, head back to Teila
Resort and enter the dance hall.

*Super Potion* $700

*Burn Heal* $250

*GourmetTreat* $2000

Talk to Reina in here to get a *Dusk Stone* and *Exp. Candy M.* You can
also battle her. Talk to the girl at the top. She'll tell us about
building hype. Do whatever you have to do to build the hype - talk to
people, battle trainers, change the song with the guy on the right.

After building some hype, an Audino trainer will appear. She uses level
55's, so you should be able to grind your team up if need be. You'll get
7 *Exp. Candy M* when you win.

Once you've hyped to the max, head into the battlefield.

Music Enthusiast Amber (Volcano Top Field)

-   Camerupt, Level 53. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Fever Pitch

    -   Hidden Power Electric

    -   Magma Drift

    -   Toxic

    -   Flame Charge

-   Aevian Toxtricity, Level 55. @ Throat Spray.

    -   Hidden Power Grass

    -   Boomburst

    -   Fever Pitch

Fever Pitch: Fire \| Special \| 70, 100, or 130 power depending on Hype
level \| 100% accuracy \| Can be used even when asleep, and wakes up all
sleeping Pokemon on the field \| On Volcanic Top Field, power is boosted
x1.2 and triggers an eruption \| Two uses transforms Cave Field into
Volcanic Field.

Relationship Points are granted based on the conditions under which you
end this battle:

-   End the battle on Snowy Mountain field (-2 Amber)

-   End the battle with \<300 Hype (-4 Amber)

-   End the battle with \>= 300 Hype (+3 Amber)

Anyways, this battle isn't super tough, but it can still be tricky. Her
Toxtricity can hit hard once it boosts its Sp. Atk. with Throat Spray,
and Chandelure hits hard as always. Speed Boost Blaziken can also be
threatening. As Jan says, if you can change the field, you'll be golden.
Mountain Field, Icy Mountain, Water Surface, Underwater can all be
useful fields you can use against her in a chain. You can also turn it
to Sky Field with a single use of Bounce! Even if you don't, a good
Earthquake user or two with something to take out the Air Balloons can
do a number on her team.

Win to get the Lyric Badge, which lets us hit Level 60, and *TM50
Overheat*! Head outside and watch the cutscene.

Head into a forest a bit and you'll have to fend off a wild Shiftry.
Down and to the right from here is 4 *Rawst Berries* and a hidden
*Zinc.* Head up into Marble Garden.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yeah! (Venam +2)

- Nah. (Venam -1)

Enter the house and after a scene, you'll be free to explore. Talk to
Anathea in the garden for a optional scene.

Exit to the woods.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Let's do this. (Venam +4)

- What about Melia? (Neutral)

- I dunno... (Venam -2)

Head back to the city and enter the house in the bottom right of town.
Head up.

Enter Blakeory Co. in the southwest. After the meeting, enter the forest
again. Head south to follow the policeman.

Go to the northeast for a *Rare Candy* and a *Leppa Berry.* Hidden
nearby is *Honey.* On your way to the south, you'll get 2 *Cheri
Berries, Revive,* 2 *Oran Berries,* and 2 *Aspear Berries* at the very
top. Eavesdrop on the conversation: you'll have to fight Gardevoir!

Angel of Death Gardevoir (No Field)

-   Dark Gardevoir, Level 60. @ Lum Berry. Ability: Pixilate. Types:
    Dark/Fairy. Stats: 88/65/135/165/135/100. 3 Shields.

    -   Psyshock

    -   Hyper Voice

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Focus Blast

This version hits pretty hard, but luckily isn't too tough to take it
out if you target its weaknesses or use Trick Room.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Worried? (Venam +2)

- Scared? (Venam -2)

- Taking too long to find me? (Venam +3)

Grab the shiny *Apartment Key.*

This isn't strictly necessary but helps us save some Pokemon later. Head
back to Kugearen and use the key on the door in the top left of the
area. Head down and read the book on the table. After that, head to the
right and read this book to get the *Weird Diary.*

Talk to Venam by Katsu's house, then return to the mansion. Beat the
first maid, then beat the second sitting on the bench. Next to her you
can get a hidden *Silk Scarf!* Interact with the statues in the four
rooms up and down from the garden: top left facing right, top right
facing down, bottom right facing left, bottom left facing up. Head
upstairs and enter the newly opened door. Grab the **Indeedee** here!

Talk to the portrait in this room to begin a puzzle.

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image54.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5in" />

This is what it should look like when completed. Enter the door
downstairs and go down.

Head down and follow the prompts. Choose whether to save the Officer, or
to save Maria. Attempting to save Maria grants (+4 Anathea Relationship
Points), but saving the policeman actually works and may affect future
versions. It also makes Gardevoir hate you particularly more. Either
head down to untie the officer, or up to save Maria.

If you chose the officer, you could choose to refuse all Gardevoir's
requests or not. Refusing them will save the officer.

Anyways, after the scene, head outside into the forest, and then to
Kugearen City. Pick North or West, but watch the scene play out. Then
pick Blakeory Co. Beat the maid.

Talk to Melia in the kitchen to get some sleep. After a bunch of scenes,
it's time for a quick battle!

Gang Leader Karrina (No Field)

-   Runerigus, Level 54. @ Red Card.

    -   Earthquake

    -   Substitute

    -   Psyshock

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Shadow Ball

-   Nidoking, Level 56. @ Expert Belt.

    -   Earth Power

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Poison Jab

    -   Flamethrower

This battle can be kind of tough, she has some strong Pokemon! That said
it's a 6v5 on no field so you should be able to win somehow.

Enter the new grove to return to the past for now. We can use this
crystal to go back to the past whenever we want.

## West Gearen City Sewers

Talk to Venam to board the boat. While onboard, say “About a 10” for
relationship points.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- About a 5. (Neutral)  
- About a 3. (Neutral)  
- About a 7. (Venam +1)  
- About a 10. (Venam +2, Melia +1)

After a lot of talking, head down and follow the path. After more
talking, head out to the left then try to enter the gate at the bottom.
Enter the room above and to the left and talk to the machine.

Head down and go through the path. Pick up *TM84 Poison Jab.* Change the
water level down from here, then head up and grab the *PP Up.* Enter the
door.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Bye. (Erick -2)  
- We're here to help! (Erick +2)

Toxel is our next target for Zumi's quest. Grab the *Hyper Potion* in
here. Head up, then grab the Rift dex entry for Code: Corroso here.

After heading up, show Erick the Weird Diary if you want to save
Garbodor.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Let's save Garbodor! (Venam +4, Melia +4)  
- Ugh... Why me? (Melia -4, Venam -4, Erick -4)  
- How about tomorrow? (Erick +1)

Dimensional Rift Garbodor (Corrupted Cave Field)

-   Garbodor, Level 65. @ Black Sludge. 3 Shields. Type: Poison/Dark.
    Stats: 120/80/190/120/190/10. Ability: Poison Heal.

    -   Sludge Wave

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Recover

This thing can be tough to take out because on this field, even after
destroying all 3 shields, it manages to heal 25% of its health every
turn with Black Sludge. Plus, it's Sludge Wave is boosted immensely and
given Rock sub-typing. That said, with strong moves and Melia's team as
support it isn't too difficult to wear it down. Alternatively, switch
the field to Volcanic by using Heat Wave, Eruption, or Lava Plume, or,
to Mountain field via Sky Uppercut.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- You're on! (Erick +2)  
- Gotta go... (Erick -2)

Once we regain control, head back down into the sewers, where we can now
get:

You can find a hidden *Mystery Bowl* in the skinny ledge on the east
overlooking the sea.

Head outside and enter the power plant. In the door to the left, head
up. Pick up the *Metal Coat* here. Head down the stairs: for a quest,
gather 5 Electric types, and 5 Fire types to donate. The easiest way to
do this is to breed a mon of each type and take all their babies back.
Return to each person with the 5 Pokemon to get the *Electrizer* and
*Magmarizer.* Pick up 2 *Cell Batteries* next to the Electrodes.

Outside the power plant to the left, you'll find a *Data Drive.*

To the west, though it is super tricky to spot, grab:

ZCell 054: West Gearen City

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image56.png"

There's a woman selling *Blast Powder* for $25000. It's pretty
expensive and unnecessary to get it here.

ZCell 055: West Gearen City

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image57.png"

Use your Itemfinder all around the city. You'll find a *Telluric Seed,
Yellow Shard, Max Repel, Dusk Stone, Float Stone, Green Shard, Zinc,
Muscle Wing, Max Repel, Red Shard, GourmetTreat.*

Cut the upper left tree to get *TM21 Frustration!*

Enter Gearen News HQ. In the bottom left you'll find a *Hyper Potion.*
Also, there's a Level 60 Audino trainer here if you need, win to get 5
*Exp. Candy L*, each time you win. Very handy for grinding! Grab the
*Wide Lens* in the upper right.

Enter the door to the right of the one with the red door in the bottom
right of the city. A guy will trade you *Protective Pads* for three
Absorb Bulbs.

Enter the red door with the sign to the left and up.

WG Rare Fossil Shop

*Old Amber* $75000

*Cover Fossil* $75000

*Plume Fossil* $75000

Speaking of Zygarde Cells, exit Junction Bridge to the right and go talk
to Ayuda, who'll give us the *Macho Brace* for finding at least 45. Our
next mission is for 70.

A couple shops have new wares:

Berry Emporium New Item (8 Badges)

*Occa Berry* $750

Buy a bunch of Occa Berries now for much later.

Next, return to the Magnolia Library and show Zumi your Pokedex with
Toxel inside. She'll give us 15 *Exp. Candy M,* as well as tell you a
hint about one way to evolve it.

Return to the help center in West Gearen.

Unown Dimension

| Pidgey       | 10       |

(+1 Karma)

Now, head to the Wispy Ruins via Wispy Tower area entrance. Take the
right vines down and enter the 8-badge gate to the right. Take the
*Elemental Seed* in the chest.

Spector Battle Quest

1.  Talk to Spector in front of the Giratina statue in town

2.  Head into Wispy Tower. Talk to Spector in here.

3.  Head into the Lost Castle to talk to Spector in the upper room.

4.  Head into Narcissa's gym. Head through the backstage theatre as
    normal and talk to Spector when you see him.

5.  Finally, meet him in the gym auditorium for a battle!

Gym Leader Spector (Haunted Field)

-   Murkrow, Level 60. @ Eviolite.

    -   Perish Song

    -   Night Shade

    -   Roost

    -   Protect

-   Gothitelle, Level 60. @ Kasib Berry.

    -   Fake Out

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Protect

    -   Psychic

-   Gengar, Level 61. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Perish Song

    -   Mean Look

    -   Spectral Scream

-   Cursola, Level 61. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Strength Sap

    -   Hex

    -   Protect

    -   Whirlpool

-   Ninetales, Level 62. @ Magical Seed.

    -   Protect

    -   Fire Spin

    -   Ominous Wind

    -   Hypnosis

-   Banette, Level 63. @ Banettite.

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Destiny Bond

    -   Protect

    -   Shadow Claw

This is a very tricky battle! Instead of focusing directly on raw
strength, only Mega Banette really has direct power. Instead, he will
try to wear you down: the initial duo of Murkrow and Gothitelle forces
you to stay in and stick around for a Perish Song unless you can knock
out Gothitelle in the first three turns of the battle. Luckily
Gothitelle will usually go for Fake Out on turn one, so one of your
Pokemon will likely get in at least one hit. Once you deal with the
first pair, Ninetales is particularly annoying because of its speed and
increased accuracy on Hypnosis, paired with Mega Banette to knock you
out, this is deadly. All in all, a tricky fight, but you can get around
the specific sleep + perish song-oriented strategies with Safeguard,
Taunt, and other similar moves if you must.

Win to get the *Ghost Memory!*

## Route 4 Eight Badge Update

Next is a quick detour to Route 4 to get some new Den Pokemon - feel
free to skip this one.

Essentially, now that we've beaten Amber, all four of the dens we've
seen so far have been updated with new Pokemon! So, I will list the
Pokemon in each here.

RIFT DEN 1 (8 - 12 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
Graveler, Nuzleaf, **Duosion**, Solosis, Tropius, **Sigilyph**, and
**Dhelmise**. The rare ones are **Relicanth, Persian**, Lumineon,
Bonsly.

RIFT DEN 2 (8 - 12 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
Unfezant, Wailmer, Dunsparce, Vullaby, Masquerain, Quagsire. The rare
ones are Chatot, Snorunt, **Glalie**, Cacnea, **Cacturne**, Claydol.

RIFT DEN 3 (8 - 12 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
**Stoutland**, Crabrawler, Pachirisu, Chimecho, Stunfisk, **Abra**. The
rare ones are **Rhydon**, **Vanilluxe**, Vanillish, Purugly, **Ditto**,
Teddiursa.

RIFT DEN 4 (8 - 12 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
Lombre, Gastrodon, **Seismitoad**. The rare ones are Mantyke, Mantine,
**Jellicent**.

Entering Cairo's shop, he has more available crests now!

Cairo's Shop New Items (8 Badges)

*Luxray Crest* 5000 Red Essences

*Druddigon Crest* 5000 Red Essences

*Thievul Crest* 5000 Red Essences

*Samurott Crest* 5000 Red Essences

Now that we have Ditto, head over to Sheridan Village, and use it to
breed the Throh we got earlier. In the daycare, talk to the girl and
trade your spare to her to get **Sawk!**

That's all we can do right now. Head back to Erick's gym and head up to
challenge him.

## Pulse Badge

Head outside. Enter the factory here. Attempt to enter the door to the
right, and you'll fight:

League Scout Amanda (Factory Field)

-   Incineroar, Level 57. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Flare Blitz

    -   Fake Out

    -   Darkest Lariat

    -   U-Turn

-   Hatterene, Level 60. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Psychic

    -   Mystical Fire

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Trick Room

-   Druddigon, Level 58. @ Druddigon Crest.

    -   Dragon Claw

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Sucker Punch

    -   Gunk Shot

-   Torkoal, Level 58. @ Heat Rock.

    -   Eruption

    -   Heave Wave

    -   Solarbeam

    -   Earth Power

-   Bronzong, Level 59. @ Occa Berry.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Gyro Ball

    -   Trick Room

    -   Sunny Day

-   Miltank, Level 58. @ Chople Berry.

    -   Return

    -   Milk Drink

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Hammer Arm

The good news is the field doesn't really do anything for her team in
this battle, so if you can exploit Factory Field for your own benefit,
go ahead. The bad news is her team is particularly good at what it does
overall and includes the first crest we must fight: Druddigon's. Crest
details are listed in the appendix below. You'll notice that Trick Room
is the central strategy she employs here: you can take advantage of that
and bring in your own heavy hitting slow team or prevent it from being
used. One strategy is to open with Pokemon immune to the Fake Out from
Incineroar in some way, another is to have a Multi-hit move strong
enough to ORKO Hatterene, and so on. If you can succeed and make sure
Bronzong similarly goes down before it can use Trick Room, you will have
an easy time here.

Head up for the gym battle!

Thunder Raid: Electric \| Physical \| 3-hit move, hits are 20, 40, and
60 power \| 100% accuracy \| On Murkwater Surface Field, power is
boosted x1.5.

I'm not saying Amanda is harder than this fight but… it's close. He does
have some threats, particularly Mega Toxtricity, whose field boosted
Overdrive that hits both of your Pokemon might just knock them entirely
off the map. Raichu's ability is always activated so it will surely
outspeed you. Other than that, though nothing goes too crazy on the
offensive side if you can manage it right. Note that on this field all
Ground moves fail, so you'll likely need to try a different strategy to
succeed here than sheer super effective move overload.

Even though there's no mountain in sight, physically, if you use
Blizzard -\> Sky Uppercut here, you can turn the field into Snowy
Mountain, allowing your Rock Sliders to go crazy. Or consider using just
the Icy Field and letting Blizzard users go off. You can also take Snowy
Mountain even further by turning it into a Mountain, then a Cave, then a
Volcano… So, there are many possibilities here.

Even without messing with the field, you can do a lot with Ground types
and other electric types.

Win to get the Pulse Badge, up to level 65 Pokemon, and *TM72 Volt
Switch.*

# Chapter 10: Stopped in Our Tracks

## A Few More Quests

There's just a few more things we can do before leaving on the train. Up
on the Valor Cliffside, if you donate to a guy 10 Rock types, you'll get
a *Protector,* which you can use to evolve Rhydon. Again, I recommend
breeding to get progress on the egg hatching achievement.

If you head to Theolia and enter the church, the rift will be gone,
meaning you can grab:

We won't be able to come back for a little while, so I recommend you
farm as much AP as you can and head to the AP vendor at the casino. We
won't be able to buy with AP until we get the HM for Strength, so get
the Golden Gauntlets and any other of the AP items you haven't yet if
you'd like. Make sure you have 8 Sitrus Berries for a quest in the next
chapter.

## Grand Express

Make sure you're ready to not come back for little while. Talk to Melia
in the train station in southwest West Gearen.

-   If you have at least 8 Points with Venam, you'll get (Venam +3
    Relationship Points). You'll be given a *Soda Pop.*

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Thank you! (Venam +1)  
- I don't like soda. (Neutral)  
- I didn't ask for this. (Venam -1, Melia -1)

-   If you have 7 or less Points with Venam, say “what about me and
    Kanon?” for relationship points with him.

> Relationship Point Choices:  
> - What about me? (Neutral)  
> - What about Kanon and I? (Kanon +2)  
> - You're gross. (Melia -2, Venam -3)

-   If you have 7 or less Points with Venam and chose “You're gross” in
    the last prompt:

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Sounds good. (Venam +2)  
- No thanks. (Venam -2)

In the hallway to your car's right, a girl will tutor you:

Hidden on this map outside the fence boundary is a *Yellow Shard, Max
Repel, Green Shard, Blue Shard, Pecha Berry, Red Shard, Ultra Potion,*
and *Elemental Seed.*

Head up and around to the left to see the scene at the bridge.

Next, head a bit south to enter Yui's Ranch. Pick up the hidden *Moomoo
Milk* and grab the *Brightpowder* hiding behind the tree by the barn
door. Enter the room to the left and pick up the hidden *Moomoo Milk*
and *Revive.* Talk to **Miltank**. If you feed it eight Sitrus Berries,
it will battle you. Pick up the hidden *Stable Mulch* and *Moomoo Milk*
in the main room, then exit the barn to the right.

*Fire Gem,* then enter the upper right barn. Hidden inside are *Moomoo
Milk, Oran Berry, Sitrus Berry,* and *Stable Mulch.*

Exit, and enter the house on the left. If you've finished Kristiline's
help quests, to continue a quest, head upstairs and talk to the guy
here, and agree to help. At night, head into the barn on the upper right
corner of the ranch. Talk to Ben, then head outside. You need to CATCH
each Inkay, but it should be easy enough.

That's all we can do up here. Head west into the Honec Woods.

There are also wild Parasect during the day, Amoongus at night, and
**Impidimp** wandering around the woods.

We can enter Darchlight Caves by heading down immediately, and hopping
down the pillars, but there is nothing of note in here yet. While you're
in this main area, talk to any of the people here 30 times. This is
necessary for a side quest in a bit.

Hidden on this map are 2 *TinyMushrooms.*

Take the top exit north. Hidden here is another 2 *TinyMushrooms,* an
*Ether, Dark Gem,* and *Reverse Candy*. Head up for a little scene with
a girl.

As in the other meadows, you can find infinite *Purple Nectar* here. We
can't explore much here yet, but we'll be back. Head back to the main
map and head all the way to the southwest corner via the pillars, grab
the hidden *Dark Gem,* and enter the clearing.

## Route 8 and Azure Shore

Here are a couple small optional areas and quests, skip them if you'd
like.

Head to the south. Hidden on the beach is a *Max Repel.* 2 *Pearls* are
also hidden in the water on this map.

Talk to the ranger near Samurott and agree to help find Oshawott. If you
come here during the morning, two of the Samurott will give you a *Rare
Candy* and a *Star Piece* respectively.

Exit the forest and head north to the broken bridge by the Grand Dream
Gate. Talk to Oshawott, then bring it back to Samurott. It will then get
stolen!

Head back to the crossroads and head west. Grab all 4 *Sitrus Berries*
and 4 *Persim Berries* in front of the manor. We'll enter that in a bit,
but head west onto Route 8.

There're only a few places we can go without strength, so start by
entering the right room on 1F. Read the book and the doll will
disappear. Next, talk to Clefairy twice in the main room, get the hidden
*Full Heal* and *Revival Herb,* and then enter the room at the very top
of 2F. Grab the *Max Repel* and talk to it again.

Rock Smash the rock on the side, then pick up the hidden *Blue Shard*
and head upstairs. Talk to it on the couch, then in the bed in the room
to the left. Exit, and smash the rocks to get to the south side of 3F.
Talk to it, then enter the next room on the left and talk to it again.
Move the candelabra up here and enter the fireplace to get *TM12 Taunt*
and a *Gate Key.*

That's all we can do here for now, so make your way back to the
crossroads.

## Darchlight Caves First Visit

Head north. On this map is a hidden *HP Up, Big Mushroom,* and *Blue
Shard.* Surf up here to grab *TM18 Rain Dance.*

Head into the top right clearing first*.* If you have an Odd Keystone,
have talked to people in the forest 30 times, and it is nighttime, talk
to the tower to battle **Spiritomb.**

Anyways, head out and enter the northwest clearing. Pick up hidden
*TinyMushroom, Yellow Shard, PP Up,* then speak to Flora and Florin in
the top area.

Darchlight Caves

|              |          |
|--------------|----------|
| Cave  | % |
| Bronzor      | 30       |
| Graveler     | 20       |
| Carbink      | 20       |
| Sandslash    | 15       |
| Wobbuffet    | 5        |
| Dugtrio      | 4        |
| **Bronzong** | 4        |
| **Wynaut**   | 2        |

After the conversation, we'll have control in the caves. Grab the hidden
*Yellow Shard, Blue Shard.*

Head east and choose which character to go with - this one doesn't
affect your future quite yet. Grab the hidden *Max Repel* abovve, then
head down your ladder and in.

You'll have another choice to make in each room - this time about
whether to expose that you saw Flora earlier either to her, Florin, or
Erin. Again neither of these choices will force you into a bad ending
quite yet, but will affect your gym leader fight for this chapter.

Head outside, and as you're walking, the cave will change. Head upstairs
and watch whatever scene you got based on your choices. Head down the
left ladder and cross the new bridge here. Hidden is a *Dusk Stone.*
Down the right ladder there is a hidden *Blue Shard.*

Go upstairs and go down, then across the bridge, pick up the hidden
*Dark Gem* at the bottom. Go into the cave entrance. Pick up the hidden
*Ether,* then head down and watch the scene. Then follow your person
south and into the cave, then across the bridge.

Basically, we're going to have to create a Darchlight mirror. Speak to
your person and interact with all the reading materials to find a
solution.

Here's the solution:

-   Type in 4589758 into the password

-   Grab black shard ore and put it in the furnace

-   Red

-   Blue

-   Green

-   Red

-   Red

-   Remove the ore from the furnace

-   Blue

-   Purple

-   Gold

-   Then, talk to the thing on the left with the small red button to
    make a *Darchlight Mirror!*

Cross the bridge to the right, and head up. Interact with the gem on the
wall up above. Head into the room on the left and go down to get a
hidden *Psychic Gem.* Go up to get *TM23 Smack Down* and a hidden *Rock
Gem.*

ZCell 062: Darchlight Caves

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image64.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.02083in" />

Head right and cross the new bridge. Up is a hidden *Hyper Potion.* Head
all the way south, picking up the hidden *Ether* as you go, and then
activate the crystal. Pick up the hidden *Revive* and *Full Heal,* then
head back up and left. Up at the top, there is a hidden *Carbos,* to the
left a hidden *Reverse Candy* and *Ghost Gem.* On the left is a *Dark
Material* as well as *TM115 Mega Punch.*

Head back east and cross the new bridge. Head down to get *TM145 Hex*
and hidden *Everstone,* then activate the gem here. At the bottom is a
hidden *Revive,* then head up. Pick up the hidden *Max Potion* and head
up.

Follow the path, activating crystals as you go. Climb the elevator to
exit and beat the Dugtrio mech.

After you get outside, if you chose Flora, now's your chance to expose
her for real, or not. Again, this won't necessarily rope you into the
worst ending, but if you do want the option to go that route, expose
Flora here.

Watch the events unfold, then head out of Honec Woods. Make your way
back to the train and talk to Melia.

## Rose Badge

Two more things to do - the Sensu Meadow is now opened. Grab *TM114
Leech Life*, and a hidden *Dark Gem, Ether,* and *TinyMushroom.*

ZCell 063: Sensu Meadow

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image65.PNG"
style="width:6.79167in;height:5.12619in"
alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with medium confidence" />

Make your way to the hole towards the top of the meadow, then fall. In
the cave, grab *TM97 Dark Pulse* and hidden *Ice Gem* and *Magical
Seed,* then exit by getting lulled to sleep in the bottom right corner
of the mushroom.

Then, head back to the main map, and go to the southeast and hop down
the logs. Surf up and east here to access Darchlight Cave again. Grab
the *Dark Memory.*

Head to crossroads and go north. Find Flora/Florin in this area and get
ready to battle. Florin battles Doubles and Flora singles.

</table>

Uproot: Grass \| Special \| 90 power \| 100% accuracy \| 100% chance to
lower the target's Special Defense by 2 stages \| On Bewitched Woods
Field, power is boosted x1.5.

Each of these battles tries to neutralize Grass' many weaknesses. Be
careful of both of their Ludicolo, who will outspeed you thanks to the
rain. Mega Sceptile hits really hard and fast and can heal itself, while
Mega Venusaur tanks two of its weaknesses thanks to Thick Fat and can
wear you down with Giga Drain and Leech Seed. On both teams, Uproot can
be threatening if you're attempting any kind of defensive strategy, so
going for a fast offense somehow might be safer.

There are lots of ways to win! Sunny Day changes the weather and the
field to Rainbow, meaning Poison moves and Fire moves are particularly
effective again. Alternatively, you can focus on a potentially Tailwind
boosted Flying-type core, since only Ferrothorn, Rotom, and Cradily take
neutral damage from them. One other strategy would be field manipulation
via Pyukumuku's Purify, which turns the field to Forest and gives Bug
moves a boost.

Win to get the Rose Badge, which lets us level to 70, and *TM53 Energy
Ball!*

Head towards Darchlight Manor and talk to Erin. Then, head back to the
train to get *HM04 Strength!* Talk to Melia in the cabin.

# Chapter 11: Grand Dream City?

## Dream District East 1st Visit

Head out into the station. After a chat, reenter the train station to
pick up a *Hyper Potion.* We finally made it to Grand Dream City, which
is larger than both Gearen's combined.

ZCell 064: Dream District

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image66.PNG"
style="width:6.82292in;height:5.08909in"
alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated" />

Cross the bridge. You'll observe that you can take the train between
areas for $1950. Since GDC is so large, I recommend at least exploring
all the connections by foot (or bike) before you start fast hopping, at
least to learn.

Enter the botanical garden to the north. Hidden throughout is a *Blue
Shard, Reverse Candy, Ether, Max Repel, Red Shard.* In the southeast
corner, you'll find a *Rare Candy,* a hidden *Wiki Berry, TM11 Sunny
Day,* and:

ZCell 065: Botanical Garden

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image67.png"
style="width:6.72917in;height:4.9375in" />

Exit the garden and enter the day care. Give the girl in here $3400 and
you'll get a *Rare Candy.* The day care here is a good choice for
breeding: Main Street is a bit longer than any line in Sheridan Village.
Head into the elevator here, and head to the 14th floor to get:

ZCell 066: Dream District

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image68.PNG"
style="width:6.73964in;height:5.10417in"
alt="Graphical user interface Description automatically generated" />

Outside, a ranger gives a *Leppa Berry* when they lose.

## Main Street 1st Visit

Head west out of the eastern Dream District.

Pick up the *Sachet* and *Reverse Candy* to the south, as well as the
items hidden all around this map: *Repel, Genius Wing, Muscle Wing,
Resist Wing, Ether,* 2 *Max Repels, Reverse Candy, Blue Shard, Hyper
Potion, Green Shard.*

In the first building from the east, on 75F, there is a hidden *Dusk
Ball.* Enter the second house from the east and go up to the 24th floor
to grab a *Moon Ball* and hidden *Ether.* Then, go up to the 45th floor
for a quick scene that activates a quest. Exit, and enter the building
to the left of the Pokemon Center. Head to the 8th floor to grab a
*Hyper Potion*! Then, go to 16th to grab a *Sun Stone.* Talk to
Igglybuff during the day for a *Carbos.*

Next, exit to the Grand Dream Gate area to the south. Enter the train
track gap to the right and head up to get:

ZCell 067: Grand Dream Gate

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image69.png"
style="width:6.625in;height:5.01042in" />

Also be sure to pick up *TM19 Secret Power* here. Someone fixed the
bridge to the south if we need to return to Route 7.

Back on Main Street, there's one more event we can do. Talk to the big
blue board on the right side of the area and change the weather to
windy. This will allow us to catch Skiploom and Jumpluff here, but also,
during the daytime, talk to the girl near the house with the T.M. on the
roof. Then, head to the east Dream District and enter the park. Battle
this guy to get *TM31 Brick Break.* Nice!

Head back to Main Street and head west.

## Dream District West 1st Visit

Immediately head up as you enter to grab:

ZCell 068: Dream District

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image70.PNG"
style="width:6.61458in;height:4.98438in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

Head to the west and follow the tree line to nab a *Rare Candy.* Hidden
on this map, you'll find *Green Shard,* 2 *Blue Shards, Health Wing,
Iron, Max Repel, Ether, Red Shard.*

Enter the building in the southeast, where we can buy a few incenses and
herbs.

Dream District West Spice Store

*Heal Powder* $450

*Luck Incense* $9600

*Full Incense* $9600

*Wave Incense* $9600

*Odd Incense* $9600

Enter the art gallery in the right side at night. Someone will give you
a *Green Shard.* Talk to the guy on a couch, and he'll offer to trade a
**Smeargle** for your Masquerain!

Head back outside. At night, head to the bottom right corner of the map
to get *TM67 Roost!*

That's all there is in these districts for now, but we'll be back. Head
back to Main Street, but this time, head north.

## Central Square 1st Visit

Head all the way to the top for a *Max Repel* and a *Green Shard.* A
ranger will give you a *Sitrus Berry* upon losing. Also, at the top,
you'll find:

ZCell 069: Central Square

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image71.png"
style="width:6.66667in;height:5in" />

Hidden on the map is *Ether,* 3 *Health Wings, Resist Wing,* 2 *Muscle
Wings.*

During the day, talk to the red head in the southeast of the pond for a
*HP Up*.

To begin a sidequest, help the lady at the bottom cross the street.
Afterwords, talk to the driver in the southwest, and he'll give you the
first *SPU Parcel.*

Switch the weather to rain, then talk to the girl on the left side of
the area. Talk to her again if you win for a trade: her **Slurpuff** for
your **Roserade**. We already can access Slurpuff via a Whipped Dream,
Link Heart and Swirlix, so take this if you'd like. You'll need a Shiny
Stone for your Roselia.

Enter the central building and talk to Rhodea, then head out. Choose
whether you want to participate in the tournament (it doesn't matter)
and watch the rest of this scene play out.

Head north to the Dream District North. There's not much to do there yet
but attempt to cross the bridge for a conversation with Isha.

Head south, and through the northeast gate.

## Shopping District 1st Visit

Head all the way to the bottom right corner to find:

ZCell 070: Shopping District

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image72.png"
style="width:6.61458in;height:5.03125in" />

The bottom row here contains a Hidden Power checker as well as a move
relearner! Talk to the little girl here who dropped her Casteliacone. If
you want to be mean, pick it up: it's hidden right under her, and give
it back. If you want to be nice, change the weather to Snow or Blizzard,
then buy one from the vendor and give it to her.

Shopping District Ice Cream (Snow / Blizzard Only)

1x *Casteliacone* $100

12x *Casteliacone* $1000

Hidden around the shopping district is *Super Repel, Repel, Elixir,
Yellow Shard, Super Potion,* and $1400 total.

Then, head into the department store here. Talk to the girl here to get
a *Stamp Card* with the first department store stamp. Side quests give
us access to more floors. For now, head upstairs.

*Heat Rock* $200

*Icy Rock* $200

That's all for this area for now, so head back to the central square.
Head straight west from here into the residential district.

## Residential District 1st Visit

If you turn the weather to Sunny, you can battle wild **Petilil!**
Hidden on this map is *Green Shard, Super Repel, Yellow Shard, Ether, PP
Up, Muscle Wing, Reverse Candy, Health Wing.*

Enter the Dream Complex and talk to the lobby host to give him the
parcel. Return to the driver in the Central District for our next
assignment.

We'll get to that in a second, but for now, re-enter the Dream Complex
and talk to Rhodea. Head to the top floor and enter the bottom left
room.

ZCell 071: Dream Complex

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image73.PNG"
style="width:6.30208in;height:4.76728in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

Talk to Rhodea in the living room, then attempt to leave. When you're
ready, head to the north into Dream District Northwest.

Hidden on this map is 2 *Mineral Balls, Max Repel,* 2 *Ethers, Green
Shard, Reverse Candy, Genius Wing, Red Shard.*

Enter Mika's cafe during the daytime and talk to Patty twice. She'll
give you a *Link Heart!* Talk to the girl next to her at night to get 10
*Dusk Balls* if you answer correctly: Kalos. Also at night, a guy in the
upper corner will give you a *Reverse Candy.* Enter the building to the
left and talk to the lobby worker for some *Leppa Berries.* Head up to
36th and talk to a guy at night for some *Quick Balls.* Grab the *Max
Revive* on 13th.

Head back to the truck guy, and he'll give you the third *SPU Parcel.*

Head to the park in Dream District East and talk to Lavender in the
park. Accept the fast travel if you want, but either way, make your way
to the Dream Complex again. Head into Talon's Penthouse on the right.
Grab the *Sharp Beak* in the left room, then read the stack of notes.
Talk to Lavender in the living room. Talk to Huey in the middle room,
then head out to fight Bladestar in the right room.

Exit, and head all the way to the Magnolia Theatre in the east side of
the Shopping District

Relationship Point Choices:  
- It's fine. (Lavender +1, Huey +1)  
- You guys dating? (Lavender +2, Huey +2)

After a lot of bizarre scenes, head back to Mika's Cafe.

Head back to the Complex and go to bed.

## Story Split 1

Here we're going to have a split choice based on what we chose to do in
the caves.

If you are in with Flora, your next destination is the botanical
gardens. Head into the backroom and talk with her. Click the trees in
the order Blue -\> Red -\> Magenta -\> Purple -\> Green, then head down
to the lab. Head up and up again and watch the scene here.

If you are not in with Flora, you can enter the judicial district now,
via the northeast corner of Dream District East. I will save exploring
this area in full until after the next gym badge, since then players on
all routes can explore it.

Enter Cassandra's office in the upper right. If you initially went with
Erin or with Flora, you'll have a choice about whether to spill the
beans to Cassandra or not about what you found. If you went with Flora
and exposed her to Cassandra, you'll net (-2 Erin Relationship Points)
now, and this will push you towards the bad ending.

Head out with Venam when you have a chance.

## The Nightmare Medallion

Now, the story segments should converge from here for a while.

Head to the shopping district and talk to Venam and Madelis here. Choose
a color, and Venam will challenge you to a battle!

Punk Girl Venam (No Field)

-   Toxtricity (Amped), Level 67. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Overdrive

    -   Boomburst

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Thunder Wave

-   Muk (Alolan), Level 67. @ Black Sludge.

    -   Gunk Shot

    -   Crunch

    -   Curse

    -   Fire Punch

-   Scolipede, Level 67. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Megahorn

    -   Aqua Tail

    -   Poison Jab

-   Venusaur, Level 68. @ Leftovers.

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Hidden Power Fire

    -   Earthquake

-   Seviper, Level 69. @ Life Orb.

    -   Sludge Wave

    -   Earthquake

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Sucker Punch

-   Charizard, Level 75. @ Charti Berry.

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Air Slash

    -   Focus Blast

    -   Roost

It's not required you win this one, but nonetheless it's an easy battle.
Nothing she has can set up bar Muk so beat her with good type coverage
and some speed and you'll be just fine. Charizard can be a bit tricky
because it's stronger, but a couple super effective hits from fast mons
will do the trick.

Soon as that's done, head into your villa in the Residential District.
After seeing what's in the boxes, head into your room to go to sleep.

After a bunch of scenes play out, head north and west to the sewer area
to talk to Huey. Then, return to the penthouse. After a strange
conversation with Alice and Allen, and sleep.

Talk to Alice and Allen in the kitchen again, then to a guy outside the
building.

Enter the medicine shop in Dream District West. Buy two *Nightmare
Medallions* for $4800 each - one for a quest later.

## Darchlight Manor Second Visit

Now, we're gonna do a few things now that we have access to HM Strength.
If you already bought the Golden Gauntlets, now they are finally useful!
Skip one section ahead if you want to continue the story.

Head into Darchlight Manor in the woods. Complete the earlier Darchlight
Manor section if you have not done so yet.

Use Strength on the rock immediately to the left, pick up the hidden
*Ghost Gem,* then head in. Pick up a second hidden *Ghost Gem,* and read
the Journal inside.

Enter the room up the stairs to the right. After an apparition, make
your way to the right side of this room...

ZCell 072: Darchlight Manor

style="width:6.66667in;height:4.98958in" />

Grab the *Old Gateau* and read the notebook. Exit the room.

Enter the room on the left side upstairs. Make your way through, grab
the *Dread Plate* and hidden *Carbos,* then read the notebook.

Head back out, then into the top room. Use strength on the left and make
your way left. There is a hidden *Spell Tag* in the bottom left corner.
Upstairs, talk to the Clefairy doll, then push this rock into the hole.

Head back downstairs and enter the newly accessible door. Grab the
*Chipped Pot,* and hidden *Old Gateau, Elixir,* and *Blue Shard,* then
read the notebook and head up.

Hidden out here are 3 *TinyMushrooms.*

Talk to the well and pull up the doll. Talk to it to get a *Light Ball.*
Not the greatest reward in the world, but we'll be able to do more here
later. With all that said and done, return to GDC.

With Nightmare Medallion in hand, enter the penthouse, and sleep in your
bed.

## Nightmare City

Talk to Aelita in the first area, then head up for another scene. In
this central area, grab the *Apophyll Pancakes* in the upper right
corner and *TM85 Dream Eater* in the upper left. Head up at the fountain
for a fight, as Aelita.

The catch with this one is that the team you must use is the same as
this one! I managed to win by using my Speed Boost Blaziken with Brave
Bird wisely. I'm sure you can outsmart the AI with the same advantages
as you.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Of course not. (Aelita -1)

- I'm not a judge, so... (Aelita +2)

Grab the *Vanilla Ice Cream* on the left. Talk to the kid here if you
did the ice cream quest to get a *Rare Candy* if you got them new ice
cream, and a *Reverse Candy* if you got them the one from the ground.

Head up and into the Nightmare Casino. Zetta will explain the rules and
give us 10000 coins. At the top right, grab *Psychic Memory.* The left
vendor will give us a *Coin Case* if we have neglected to get one yet.

Nightmare Casino Left Vendor

50 Coins $1000

500 Coins $10000

Nightmare Casino Right Vendor

500 Puppet Coins 1000 Coins

3500 Puppet Coins 5000 Coins

8500 Puppet Coins 10000 Coins

However, you need not deal with buying puppet coins or playing slots if
you simply win battles. Talk to Don Carto in the bottom right: he will
sponsor us with 10x the battle rate. So, by betting 10000 the first
battle and 100000 the second battle we will win over 1000000.

That said, the battles are somewhat tough: each of the three randomly
chosen trainers has an Ultra Beast and a Legendary Dog. Still, you
should be able to set up against the starting Pokemon and overcome.

Talk to Zetta with at least 1000000 Puppet Coins, then head up. Grab
the *Revive.*

There's an Audino level grinder here if you want to push your levels up
to 70. Win to get 6 *Exp. Candy L* each time. Then, talk to Zetta in
front of the box for a battle.

A somewhat tough singles battle. Again, a speedy rock type can deal
massive damage to his team but watch out for Silvally in particular. If
it gets off a SD, Return is gonna hit hard, so find a way to whittle it
down without getting one-shotted. With a good team of 6 though his group
of 5 will go down quickly.

## Trickery Badge

Head into the box and go into the upper room. Step on the bottom right
and top left switch only to solve the puzzle, then talk to Aelita for a

Bunraku Beatdown: Psychic \| Special \| 75 power, but increases in power
for each knocked out ally \| 100% accuracy \| On Psychic Terrain, power
is boosted x1.5.

Time for a little lesson in Trickery. You ultimately are going to be
fighting not just their team of 10 but also with the fact that Aelita's
AI isn't always doing the best thing. Claydol's walls are going to be
annoying - you must get Aelita to, or use brick break, else there's not
a very easy way to OHKO even Magenta's sweeper team very easily. The
strategy here I recommend is knocking out Claydol first then going
exclusively for Neon, as if Xatu/Bronzong are out, they're tame to
fight. If you can get to just Neon with Aelita having Hawlucha/Staraptor
alive you're in good shape but watch out for how ridiculously bulky and
strong the Musharna is.

Head into the room on the right to pick up *TM29 Psychic* behind the
post! Oh yeah! Then, head into the box.

When you awaken, talk to the box at the table to get the *Trickery
Badge!* Nice.

Head outside to talk to Aelita.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- I'll go with you. (Aelita +2)  
- I know Erin. (Neutral)  
            - Maybe... (Aelita -2)

Then head over to the Grand Dream Station. Talk to her here, and enter
the train headed to Route 9.

Explore the route a bit. There is also an Audino Breeder in the area,
each time you win, you will get 7 *Exp. Candy L.*

At the top, you'll find:

ZCell 074: Route 9

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image76.png"
style="width:6.64583in;height:4.88542in" />

Head down to the bottom part of the route. Here, you'll encounter wild
Sandygast**.**

Hidden on Route 9, you'll find a *Calcium, Carbos, Big Mushroom, Resist
Wing,* and *Swift Wing*.

Surf up and around to the right here. At the top, you'll find:

ZCell 075: Route 9

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image77.PNG"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.05236in" />

Back on the main part of the route, enter the first cave entrance on the
right.

Forlorned Cavern

Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard,* then head into the room at the top with
the crystal and pick up a hidden *Pretty Wing* as well as:

ZCell 076: Forlorned Cavern

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image78.png"
style="width:6.63542in;height:4.9375in" />

That's all we can do in this section of the cave, so head back out and
go to the left, where the hiker is, and enter this cavern. At the top,
use rock climb to grab an *Ability Capsule.* There's also a *Dusk Stone*
hidden behind the rock smash path at the bottom. Pick up the hidden
*Mineral Ball* and *Ether* as you go to the right.

Exit at the top right, then pick up the hidden *Muscle Wing* and follow
the path to the next cave entrance. There is a hidden *Clever Wing* and
*Soda Pop* along this path: follow it to get *TM35 Flamethrower!* The
tree here also has hidden *Honey* in it.

That's all the exploring we can do for now, so head towards the
northwest portion of the route, then approach the Rose Theater. Use cut
on the bamboo on the left side to encounter **Komala**! Surf across:

ZCell 077: Route 9

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image79.PNG"
style="width:7.14583in;height:5.28243in" />

Enter the theater.

## Rose Theater First Visit

Relationship Point Choices:  
- Don't be so harsh... (Aelita -2)  
- Stop being ignorant! (Aelita -4)  
- You did what you had to do. (Aelita -1)

Once you regain control, head through either of the two hallways and
enter the stage. Talk to Ayuna and agree to help her find her Kimono
Sisters. This starts a quest that we'll get to in just a bit.

While you're in this room, head to the southeast to grab:

ZCell 078: Rose Theater

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image80.PNG"
style="width:6.41667in;height:4.79604in"
alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated" />

Exit the southwestern most door of the theater, and you'll grab *TM120
Solar Blade.* There is also a hidden *Fresh Water* nearby. Exit the
southeasternmost door to grab a *Flying Memory.* If you exit one of the
top doors of the theatre, you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball* and listen
in on a conversation between Souta and Eldest.

Head upstairs, and into the left door.

# Chapter 12: Remember, I Love You

## Judicial District

Outside, accept Aelita's request for fast travel. There are a couple
side quests and areas we can tackle right now. Skip two sections ahead
for the story bits.

From the east side of Dream District East, we can access the Judicial
District. You already came here if you exposed Flora, but here I'm
covering the optional content within.

ZCell 079: Judicial District

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image81.png"
style="width:6.65625in;height:4.97917in" />

Also, use your Itemfinder here for a *Link Heart.*

At night, turn the weather to Thunderstorm via one of the monitors, and
catch a **Tynamo** with a GourmetTreat.

Head into the upper left building and talk to the guy on the top floor.
Head back to Dream District West and talk to the museum owner and the
guy near him, then return to the interested buyer. Return to the museum
to learn of the painting's fate! We'll get the thief later.

In the Police Station, head down to the lost and found. This area allows
you to catch up on limited time items, so grab any you missed while
you're here. You can also look at the criminals on B2F. You may be
wondering what Cleffa did to land itself there, but *trust me on this
one, you don't want to know.*

That's it for now: we'll start the Kimono Girls' side quest now.

## Kimono Girls Quest

We are going to find all the Kimono girls.

1\) Kimono Girl Beatrice: First: Judicial District Police Department.
But she needs us to do something first. Head to Route 9 and go to the
beach and fight the white-haired guy here. Afterwards, return to
Beatrice.

To conclude the SPU Parcel quest, talk to the guy at the desk of the
police station, and give him the final parcel. Head back to the trucker.
Talk to him, and he'll activate an encounter on Route 9 that we will get
to in a bit.

2\) Kimono Girl Lana: First, northwest Dream District outside of Ruka's
Cafe. Head down into the Residential District.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Uh... Yeah. (Damien +1)  
- No clue. (Neutral)

Next, you'll find her at Nightmare City (Left side of second map). Save
her from **Sableye.** Then, meet at the Dream District Northwest area
again.

3\) Kimono Girl Efi: Grand Dream Gate (east of GDC entrance). She will
give you a *Pearl.*

4\) Kimono Girl Midori: Oblitus Town (top, behind the decrepit gym)

5\) Kimono Girl Sesilia: Sensu Meadow (right side of the maze area).
Answer no to her question.

6\) Kimono Girl Eyna: Honec Woods (shrine area to the west of the main
area)

7\) Kimono Girl Ruka: Route 9 (Where the Flamethrower T.M. was, via
Forlorned Cave)

On our way back, enter the cave entrance on Route 9 to the north of
where we fought the white-haired guy. If we do, we can get **Dewpider.**

Once you've found them all, next, head back to the Rose Theater and talk
to Ayuna. You're going to have to fight all 8 Eeveelutions in a row, at
Level 80-82. Set up the best team possible and take them on. Win, and
you'll get Eevee with special moves and an *Ice Stone!* Head down to
talk to the hiker in the crowd, to get your second *Department Store
Stamp!*

Grab the *Ether* down from here. The girl to the right is a tutor.

Axis High University Move Tutor (Right)

Water Pledge 3 Blue Shards

Grass Pledge 3 Green Shards

Fire Pledge 3 Red Shards

Up in the upper right corner, you'll find the Name Rater and the Move
Relearner, next to a *Green Shard.* Neat.

Talk to the high striker machine here. Pay the price, then it will
randomly payoff as follows:

2% *HM06 Dive*

14% *Poke Doll.* Note that the first time you get it, it will be a
**Stufful!**

22% Refund

62% Nothing

So, grab what you need from here. Talk to the guy on the left and give

Once you win, you'll get **Darumaka.**

On the left, there are more vendors.

Axis High University Right Vendor Store

*Vanilla Ice Cream* $400

*Choc Ice Cream* $600

*Berry Ice Cream* $800

She'll also rarely have *Blue Moon Ice Cream* to sell.

Axis High University Left Vendor Store

*Sachet* $1000

*Funnel Cake* $7000

*Whipped Dream* $1000

Talk to the guy on the left. He'll offer us a chance at a little game,
depending on which bait we buy. Standard bait is $2000, Delicious bait
is $7500, and Gourmet bait is $20000. Here's a breakdown of what you
can get for each:

We can catch Wishiwashi elsewhere, and we also can buy Sail and Jaw
Fossils elsewhere, so this is primarily useful right now for its
evolution items and Horsea.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- You're on! (Aelita +1, Adam +2)  
- Uh... No thanks. (Aelita -1, Adam -2)    

Pop Star Risa Raider (No Field)

-   Tuff-Puff Jigglypuff, Level 85. @ Air Balloon.

    -   Poison Jab

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Draco Meteor

    -   Flamethrower

This is a 1v1. You don't have to win this one though. So, this may seem
to be Jigglypuff, but it has the same ability, moves, and base stats as
a different Pokemon, but the same typing as normal… anyways, this is a
very winnable battle, you just must find something with a powerful
Poison or Steel move that can survive all four of these attacks.

## District of Hope

Head west from Axis High, then head into the first building. Grab the
*Thunderstone* on 15F. Outside, head to the south. Grab the hidden
*GourmetTreat, Green Shard*, *Persim Berry, Blue Shard,* and *Aspear
Berry,* as well as the *Soda Pop* behind the dumpster.

After exploring a bit, head north through the gate. Pick up hidden
*Super Repel, Elixir, Rock Gem,* and *Yellow Shard.* Enter the Hospital
of Hope and enter the door on the left side. After a lengthy scene, head
back out.

Fast travel to the Rose Theater! Enter the Theater and enter the right
room upstairs.

Relationship Point Choices:

- This is stupid. (Kanon -2, Erin +2)

Activate the crystal - we're going back in.

Follow the path down and to the right.

Relationship Point Choices:

- Uh... (Vivian -1)

Next you have to fight a Level 1 Deoxys. Obviously it is easy, but for
relationship points losing grants (Aelita -1, Vivian -1) and running
away grants (Aelita -2, Vivian -2).

- I'm in! (Neutral)  
- Can i think about it? (Neutral)

Once you get control again, enter the Heracross Woods.

Head east again into the Heracross Woods.

Heracross Woods (Past)

| Shiftry      | 5        |
| Pinsir       | 5        |

Grab the *Max Repel* here and item find to get *Ultra Ball* and *Tiny
Mushroom.*

Chase this Heracross into the bottom right part of the forest, then
sneak underneath the twigs in the bottom left corner of that area to get
to Heracross. Run to the back part of the forest. Then, re-enter the
village after Aelita's amulet gets taken. Talk to Aelita by the berries.

Go upstairs and interact with the table to get the *Garufa Spellbook.*
Head down the stairs after the scene.

Sensei Vivian (Blessed Field)

-   Alakazam, Level 73. @ Alakazite.

    -   Psychic

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Focus Blast

    -   Calm Mind

This one honestly isn't too bad, but her team does make good use of the
field. Her Mega Alakazam will outspeed most Pokemon and its field
boosted Psychic is brutal, so you want to find some way to outspeed and
one shot it. Watch out for the Assault Vest pair - they can eat up
super-effective moves easily and hit back with wide coverage. If you've
gotten this far though this battle won't be too much trouble.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You okay? (Melia +2)  
- What's up? (Neutral)  
- Can we leave now? (Melia -1)

## Aevium (Alt. Future)

After the battle, you'll be whisked away. After a few scenes, head up
and into the cave. After you regain control, talk to Amber in the
garden, then Kenneth in the cave. Go to sleep.

Next, you'll regain control in a jail cell on the Renegade ship. Talk to
Granny to get blankets, then to Kenneth, then to the egg.

Head down one level and avoid the shattered glass as you beat grunts.
Push the red button. Head up another level. The PC and healing star are
here. Beat the grunts as you push the blue and yellow buttons in this
room. Head up again and go past the dead lasers, then up the stairs.
Follow the path.

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Scald

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Recover

As in her last fight the Swift Swim can catch you off guard, but this
team is certainly much less threatening. Electricity tears through most
of it as before, and a Ghost / Psychic / Dark core can also do wonders
here. You can do it!

Head back up and outside to the deck.

Relationship Point Choices:
- We needed a new sail... (Melia +2)

- She loves her new job. (Melia +1)

- Yes. (Neutral)

Enter the captain's room to speak with Madame X, then open the door in
the room to the right. Downstairs, talk to Melia.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Who knows... (Melia +1)

- Why does it matter? (Melia -2)

- It's necessary. (Melia +2)

And, if you have at least 5 Melia Relationship Points at this point,
you'll get another (Melia +5).

Head down to the bottom to talk to them all again. Once you wake up,
exit the boat via the deck. Follow the path and watch the scenes.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- We must press on (Melia +2, Keta +2)  
- It's hopeless... (Melia -2, Keta -2)

In the room to the right, there are encounters!

Head out and up, into the right room and read the book thing here. Do
the same for the left room. Then enter the top room.

Survivor Kenneth (Chess Field)

-   Banette, Level 71. @ Spell Tag.

    -   Toxic

    -   Phantom Force

    -   Foul Play

    -   Protect

-   Alolan Muk, Level 72. @ Shuca Berry.

    -   Gunk Shot

    -   Crunch

    -   Curse

    -   Ice Punch

-   Krookodile, Level 72. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Earthquake

    -   Crunch

    -   Stone Edge

    -   Low Kick

-   Weavile, Level 73. @ Life Orb.

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Throat Chop

    -   Low Kick

    -   Poison Jab

-   Aevian Lapras, Level 74. @ Leftovers.

    -   Ice Beam

    -   Surf

    -   Toxic

    -   Perish Song

-   Lucario, Level 74. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Meteor Mash

    -   Close Combat

    -   Bullet Punch

    -   Swords Dance

A bit harder of a fight this time, but still nothing intense. Aevian
Lapras can be threatening, as can Lucario if it gets off a Swords Dance.
Otherwise, though you should be able to set something up against Banette
or Muk and sweep if you need to.

Up ahead, we're going through a maze. The order of doors we must go
through to complete it is as follows: LUURULDD. If you complete the maze
in time, you'll be granted (Melia +5) Relationship Points.

Next is a battle against Melia.

Enigma Melia (Chess Field)

-   Snorlax, Level 72. @ Silk Scarf.

    -   Strength

    -   High Horsepower

    -   Heavy Slam

    -   Fire Punch

-   Hydreigon, Level 74. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Gilded Arrow

    -   Nasty Plot

-   Zoroark, Level 73. @ Blackglasses.

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Sucker Punch

-   Meganium, Level 73. @ Meganium Crest.

    -   Leech Seed

    -   Toxic

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Nature Power (-\> Ancient Power)

-   Gardevoir, Level 73. @ Life Orb.

    -   Psychic

    -   Moonblast

    -   Calm Mind

    -   Mystical Fire

-   Togekiss, Level 74. @ Synthetic Seed.

    -   Aura Sphere

    -   Gilded Arrow

    -   Nasty Plot

    -   Dazzling Gleam

This is a tough fight this time around! Every one of her Pokemon are
pretty threatening in some way. Zoroark likes to prank you and murder
with field boosted Sucker Punch - so know that it will be disguised as
Togekiss, or Gardevoir if Togekiss is dead, etc. If Meganium gets off an
Ancient Power with boost, you might be screwed as it will never die
thanks to its crest! Gardevoir is also very fast, and field boosted
Psychic is no joke. That said, you can overwhelm her: half of her team
is weak to Poison and the other half Fighting, for example. You can also
try to set up your own tank - if she can't sufficiently set up this may
work.

Relationship Point Choices:
- About what?  
- Sigh (Melia -3)

-   If you choose Hand it Over, well… you're gonna get a game over. A
    game over that in fact will write to your save that you made that
    choice should you click Try Again. If that's what you want, go for
    it. But if not, better make sure you have a backup if you want to
    see how that route plays out.

-   Abandon Them is a passing grade! The story will continue fine, but
    it's not the perfect ending.

-   Do Nothing, i.e., let the timer run out, is the answer that will get
    you towards the best ending.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Are you okay?! (Melia +2)

- uh... You good? (Neutral)

- What happened? (Neutral)

Time to play as Melia. Follow the path!

Hood Emma (No Field)

-   Zoroark, Level 74. @ Blackglasses.

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Grass Knot

-   Gardevoir, Level 75. @ Pixie Plate.

    -   Moonblast

    -   Psychic

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Calm Mind

-   Togekiss, Level 78. @ Synthetic Seed.

    -   Aura Sphere

    -   Gilded Arrow

    -   Nasty Plot

    -   Dazzling Gleam

A pretty easy fight for her team.

Tell Melia “Are you okay!?” for relationship points, then prepare for a
battle!

Little Demon Melanie (No Field)

-   Galarian Mr. Mime, Level 73. @ Eviolite.

    -   Calm Mind

    -   Psychic

    -   Thunder Fang

    -   Fire Fang

    -   Ice Fang

-   Alcremie, Level 75. @ Alcremite.

    -   Recover

    -   Draining Kiss

    -   Mystical Fire

    -   Calm Mind

The news is good: Melia is your ally, so this is a 12v6. Pretty hard to
lose this one, thankfully.

Relationship Point Choices:
- We have to go. (Neutral)

- It was fun. (Neutral)

- Where's the exit? (Mosely -2)

## Aevium (Past) 2nd Visit Part 2

    -   Bulk Up

    -   Earthquake

slow, you'll be able to easily wear it down with good special moves
easily.

Relationship Point Choices

- I did all the work. (Melia -2)

Relationship Point Choices:
- Catch it! (Melia +1)

    to see the group. Follow the path and watch the scenes.

-   Back at HQ, go into the left room.

Dimensional Rift Ferrothorn (Burning Field)

-   Ferrothorn, Level 75. @ Metronome. Type: Fire/Steel. Ability: Shift.
    > 3 Shields.

    -   Steamroller

    -   Fire Lash

    -   Iron Head

    -   Earthquake

Phase 1 Base Stats: 300/80/240/80/250/115.

Phase 2 Base Stats: 600/250/200/80/200/240.

This is a tough battle. It has two forms - the second comes out as soon
as you destroy all three shields. Luckily the first only has 80 base
attack, meaning you can take advantage of the beginning of the battle to
completely abuse it. Lower its attack by six stages, its accuracy if you
want, whichever defense stat you plan to attack to knock it out, even
its speed so much that you can outspeed it even with its 240-base speed.
Due to its typing, Earthquake or Earth Power might be your strongest
choices.

-   Once you emerge victorious, talk to Looker and Anabel on 36F to get
    the *Rift Notes.*

-   Return to the help center to get $25000 and the third Department
    Store Stamp!

-   At some point, head back to the room where you fought Ferrothorn,
    interact with the panel in the back, then enter the right room. Read
    the journal and use the Itemfinder in here to get *Dubious Disc!*

GameFreak, about 8 years ago, did something interesting. They upped the
BST ceiling from the impressive 720 in the god of Pokemon Arceus to 780,
in Rayquaza's mega form. What's more, they gave Mega Rayquaza the
ability Delta Stream, its own custom weather. But, in order to make
Delta Stream stand out above lame Air Lock, they made a couple changes.
For one, it neutralizes all Ice, Electric, and Rock moves used against
flying types, greatly improving its defensive capabilities as now
Mega-Rayquaza only must field two 2x weaknesses instead of three plus a
4x weakness. Second, to fit the lore, Delta Stream cannot be overwritten
by any other weather. It was so strong the Smogon tier literally called
“Uber” could not contain the power levels of this creature, leading to
the creation of the “Anything Goes” tier. So, Mega-Rayquaza is busted,
and its ability is a big part of why.

Thankfully Delta Stream does come with a few drawbacks though. The four
(4) lines named Golduck, Drampa, Altaria, and Lickilicky can block it
out via Cloud Nine, so even though these four are not particularly good
otherwise they have a purpose - simply sending one out at the same time
as Mega-Rayquaza opens up its 4x Ice and Rock weaknesses… but that
effect only lasts as long as they're in battle, so it's not really
significant. The other, more significant thing may seem like a
no-brainer, but is still notable. Like Primal Kyogre and Primal
Groudon's signature weathers, when Mega-Rayquaza exits the battlefield,
it's signature weather also leaves with it. So, a singles team of all
Flying types boasting Mega-Rayquaza cannot all benefit from the effect,
since once Mega-Rayquaza leaves the field so does the rest of the team's
safety from their weaknesses.

So, with all this in mind, what happens when a game, maybe whose name
begins with “P” and ends with “okemon Rejuvenation”, decides to just…
have this weather always on for an entire 6v6 fight? Against all Flying
Pokemon? On top of a field effect that already significantly strengthens
Flying types via various ability and move buffs? What happens when this
weather does *not* only remain on the field when a single Pokemon is
out, when the player is faced with dealing with a nearly weakness-less
team under all circumstances except bringing out one of four random
Pokemon with Cloud Nine? The answers to all these questions, I believe
are simple. That is, I, BIGJRA, writer of this gargantuan guide, have
quite a tough time. And you might too!

His first mon comes in, a Skarmory that will likely cripple your lead as
it has Sturdy and an insane field boosted Sky Attack. It also has an
Elemental Seed, guaranteeing Souta 8 turns of free tailwind. Even if you
change the field to mountain / volcanic top, 4 of his Pokemon have
Heavenly Wing to bring it right back. In fact, all six of his team
members sport at least one of Heavenly Wing/Hurricane/Sky Attack, sure
to deal heavy damage and tons of OHKOs via an offensive type fielding no
immunities. But, what if you can outspeed? Well… good luck killing
anything. Since Flying's weaknesses will be neutered by the weather and
Normal's one weakness is canceled by flying, Unfezant and Pidgeot cannot
be hit with super effective moves under the standard circumstances. The
wind will ruin whatever Rock/Ice/Electric strategies you had in mind,
plus Big Pecks activations, and Dragonite's Multiscale adding to the
team's bulk.

Luckily there are a few solid strategies to consider. As stated before,
cloud nine users can temporarily disable immunities, so perhaps Drampa
with an Electric move or Golduck with an Ice move can find success.
There are also some field changes we can do. Using Smack Down/Gravity
twice can bring you to Mountain field, which will at least stop the Big
Pecks from activating. Note that Flying moves are still boosted on this
field. If you go for Lava Plume or Blizzard from here, you can take it
to Volcano and Snowy Mountain, allowing you to win with some strategy
involving Fire/Ice moves respectively. That said, his Dragonite can get
a Weakness Policy boost and rampage with boosted Thunder in the former
and again, flying moves hit hard in the latter. If you really want to go
crazy with the field changing strategy, from Mountain, use Dig to bring
it to a Cave, which is a good way to neutralize most of his strategy. If
you can live enough turns, use Blizzard to freeze the cave for a solid
Ice core, or from here use Magma Drift/Lava Plume to get to play on a
water's surface, which can be nice for Water and Electric oriented
teams.

Another plausible strategy is, well, if you can't beat him, join him!
The Sky Field can be beneficial for your team, too! The good news is
that the first 8 turns of Tailwind that Souta gets are the *only* turns
of Tailwind he can get, meaning equipping just two of your Pokemon with
the seed means that you can nullify the effects of his tailwind for the
first 8 turns and then outspeed him during a different 8 turns.
Honchkrow is an option, as with Moxie, you can boost and with a Tailwind
of your own, outspeed some of his team and hit incredibly hard with Sky
Attack. Alternatively, although the Strong Wind stops them from being
super effective on anything not named Swanna, Electric moves are still
very potent on this field due to boosts, and Electric types still resist
Flying. Thunder always hits and is boosted, so if you have something
fast like Electivire with Thunder, you might find success.

I probably sound like a broken record by now, but Trick Room is also a
great choice.

Win to get *TM62 Acrobatics!* And more importantly, you'll get the
Golden Wing Badge.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Are you okay? (Erin +2)

- He doesn't matter. (Erin -4)

You'll also get... *Souta's Cane*. Well, that's interesting.

## The Aelita Incident

After a conversation with Erin and Eldest, head into the middle room
upstairs. After the scene, exit the building.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Let's save Aelita! (Melia +3, Erin +3)

- Can't Erin just go? (Erin -3, Melia -3)

As soon as you're ready, talk to Erin and agree to enter the rift. Head
up and follow the path, it's quite straightforward. Grab the *Rift Notes
on Pulse: Bella* and continue. Erin is gonna help us with this fight:

Dimensional Rift… Aelita?? (Dimensional Rift Field)

-   “Aelita”/Regirock, Level 80. @ Leftovers. Ability: Savagery. Type:
    Rock/Fighting. Stats: 200/190/200/190/200/200.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Earthquake

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Aura Sphere

Every turn you attack Aelita she gets a massive attack/special attack
boost. Furthermore, she likes to use powerful doubles moves, meaning
every turn she might knock out both yours and Erin's Pokemon. Luckily
Erin does help here: for example, her Absol uses super effective
Superpower and has a Focus Sash. The key is to slow it down enough that
you can overwhelm it with super effective attacks once the 3 shields are
broken.

Back inside, head into the left room upstairs.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You sure you're okay? (Melia +1, Erin +1)

- ... (Neutral)

Relationship Point Choices:
- Let's save Venam! (Melia +3, Erin +2)

- ... (Neutral)

Relationship Point Choices:
- Welcome back! (Aelita +4)

- Too speedy... (Erin -2, Aelita -2)

That concludes chapter 12!

# Chapter 13: Conflicting Renunion

## A Note about Where Love Lies

Completing all the content so far marks the recommended point in the
story you should consider going to play Version -1: Where Love Lies, a
separate game made by the same creators which acts as a prequel to a
part of this story. It is not required that you play it but it gives
perspective and history on certain events in this game. It is located
here:

[https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34082-version-1-where-love-lies/&page=1](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34082-version-1-where-love-lies/&page=1)

If you want a guide to the side story: Lucifer on the forums wrote up a
fantastic guide to getting 100% in the side game, and so I wouldn't want
to waste time by writing my own guide to it.

[https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34308-spoilers-the-completionists-guide-to-where-love-lies/](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34308-spoilers-the-completionists-guide-to-where-love-lies/)

If you did play WLL and got a certain password at the end for getting
the good ending however, head over to GDC's Central Building during the
morning or the daytime and talk to a receptionist to get **Riolu!** The
password, if you forgot/just want the reward, the password is 489234.

Now onto the story content!

## Scholar District

Enter the Scholar district, to the right of Axis High, or to the south
of Route 9.

Scholar District

|                       |          |                   |          |                        |          |

Using the itemfinder around this district, you'll find a *Sitrus Berry,
Ether, Hyper Potion, Super Potion, Blue Shard, Honey, Lemonade, Rose
Tea, Green Shard, Max Repel,* and *Casteliacone.*

Enter the student rec. center. In the left room you'll find another game
corner! Three of the vendors are exactly the same as in Chrisola, but we
can get a few new Pokemon.

Top Right Pokemon Prizes

**Aron** 5000 Coins

**Durant** 13500 Coins

**Mienfoo** 15000 Coins

**Rufflet** 20000 Coins

**Axew** 30000 Coins

That said, they're ridiculously expensive. It would probably take
something like 5-10 hours of Voltorb flip to get enough coins to get all
of them. In the money to coins conversion, to get all of them you would
need to convert $1670000, which you probably do not have unless you
haven't been buying anything and have spammed Pay Day or something. But…
for all five, this is the only way to get them right now. So, grind it
out now or later if you want to complete your Pokedex.

Head west and south to get to the National Park. Back-to-back, you'll
find:

ZCell 082: National Park

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image85.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.02083in" />

ZCell 083: National Park

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image86.png"
style="width:6.625in;height:5.04167in" />

Hidden around the park is 2 *Revives, Liechi Berry, Lum Berry, Pecha
Berry,* and a *Sitrus Berry.*

That's about it for this area for now. Talk to Melia and Erin to enter
the Blakeory Anatheum, but don't talk to Erin inside just yet if you
want to continue two optional quests.

## Lost Camp Pt. 3

First, if we're all caught up on the Lost Camp side quest:

-   Head to the Hospital of Hope, talk to Mosely at the top. Accept her
    request.

-   At night, head to the south part of the district. Talk to her again,
    then, in the hospital, talk to her again.

-   Go down two flights and talk to the cash register. Then, head back
    up and go in. Fight the cop. Go upstairs, fight the cop.
    Unfortunately, you get no healing, and *wiping out makes you unable
    to continue the quest.* So, make sure you heal / save before each
    match.

-   Make your way down through the gauntlet of cops. Talk to Isha, this
    is it for now.

## ANA Quest Part 2

If you've already done part 1:

-   Head over to the Hospital of Hope and enter the door on the left
    side. Talk to the nurse and the cop.

-   Head outside and talk to Ana in front of the HOH. Head south to
    enter the Pokemon hospital. Enter the first door.

-   Return to the District of Hope when you can and cross the bridge to
    the south. Beat the grunts.

-   While you're in this area, head to the dream district west, then go
    to the art museum and talk to the owner, who will let you keep the
    painting. Keep it for now.

-   Return to Dylan's House in the Underground, and talk to Ana and
    Dylan here.

-   Head into the Blakeory Anatheum and go upstairs, then talk to Dylan
    and Ana.

-   Head out and north to Route 9 and find Ana. After a battle (win or
    lose is fine), agree to go to Dylan's apartment. Talk to Ana here.

Unfortunately, we cannot proceed anymore in this quest, so head back to
Scholar District.

## Voidal Chasm 1st Visit

Enter the Blakeory Anatheum. Talk to Erin at the top. Head to the east
side of the library and talk to Thomas.

Walk back to the park in the center of Scholar District and talk to Huey
again. Yet again our story will split a little bit depending on how we
handled the Darchlight saga… oh boy.

Be prepared to not be able to return to GDC for a little bit.

If you just watched Flora escape, head up at Route 9 to fight Bladestar.
Once you win, you'll be taken to the Voidal Chasm.

If you just watched Flora talk to Jenkyl, talk to the group, then head
back to the National Park with Kanon. Once you talk to him and Beheeyem,
you'll be taken to the Zorrialyn Desert!

At this point, we're basically in the same “region”, just on opposite
sides. I'll be covering everything in this guide in the order of the
group that starts at Voidal Chasm, but just know the same items, wild
Pokemon, etc. can be accessed in both routes. For now, if you took the
Beheeyem route, we'll need to come here in the story anyways in a bit,
so jump to the next section to explore the desert for now, then return
to the chasm section after.

Again, if you're entering the chasm from the outside, you'll be heading
from the top down, but this will cover you from the point of view of a
player who started at the bottom.

Voidal Chasm (Main Areas / Backroom)

|                  |          |
|------------------|----------|
| Grass     | % |
| **Golurk**       | 35       |
| Claydol          | 20       |
| Skuntank         | 15       |
| Golett           | 10       |
| Boldore          | 10       |
| Sableye          | 5        |
| Carbink / Mawile | 5        |

Hidden in the first room is 7 *Ethers* and a *Dusk Ball.*

On B3F, rock climb up here, and you'll find:

ZCell 084: Voidal Chasm

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image87.png"
style="width:6.60417in;height:4.92708in" />

Rock climb up again, and head left and down. Use your Itemfinder for a
*Dusk Stone*. Head through the door at the top, then exit out the door
to your right. Rock climb to get *TM148 Phantom Force.* Exit back out
via Rock Climb and go to B2F.

Head straight east then north to grab an *Odd Keystone*, then south and
east for a *Razor Claw.* Head up and east across the crossroad bridge to
get a *White Herb.* Then, head to the top left and rock climb up.

ZCell 085: Voidal Chasm

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image88.png"
style="width:6.61458in;height:4.90625in" />

There is also a hidden *Ability Capsule* up here. Back down from here,
while exploring the main part of this room, you'll find a *Razor Claw,
Odd Keystone,* and a *White Herb* as well as hidden 5 *Ethers,* and *PP
Up.*

In the vs. Bladestar route, you'll meet up with a familiar figure at the
top here. Here you will gain (+1 Reina) Relationship Point if you saved
her in Mt. Valor, and (-1 Reina) if not.

Hood ??? (Dimensional Field)

-   Silvally, Level 75.

    -   Swords Dance

    -   Multi Attack

    -   Iron Head

    -   Crunch

Winning is optional (and easy, since it's just one Pokemon) but will
grant you (+1 Ren) Relationship Point.

Before continuing, you can grab another hidden *Ether* and *Rare Candy.*

Continue into the door. The next room hides 10 *Ethers,* you'll find an
*Old Scarf* down the rock climb path. Once you're ready, exit at the
northeast corner.

This next room contains 3 more hidden *Ethers,* and the final room 5
more. Why so many *Ethers?*

## Zorrialyn Desert

Again, this guide starts in the northeast corner outside of Voidal
Chasm.

Zorrialyn Desert (Main Areas)

|                          |          |                    |          |

| **Heliolisk**            | 5        | **Nidoqueen**      | 1        |
| **Budew (Aevian)**       | 2        |                    |          |

Make sure somewhere in the desert you catch Aevian Budew for Zumi's
quest. Interact with **Mandibuzz** flying around for a battle. There are
also **Alolan Exeggutor** in various spots in the desert.

Zorrialyn is like a big loop - I will explore it clockwise, so before
heading west, head to the south from the Voidal Chasm. Along this path
with the itemfinder you'll find 2 *Red Shards, 2 Max Repels, Yellow
Shard, Synthetic Seed.* Don't head into the southern exits quite yet
though. Hidden as you go to the west from here, there is a hidden
*Revival Herb* and *Leaf Stone.* Grab the *Max Ether* here.

We can't do anything yet in the Alamissa Urben yet. Don't go to the
south entrance or else you'll lose some money! Further west hidden is a
*Mental Herb, Max Repel, Max Ether, Yellow Shard.* There is also a
*Mineral Ball* and *Ether* we can pick up. Take the second set (from the
east) of rock climb to pick up *TM37 Sandstorm.*

Head down the rocks, and to the left.

Pick up a hidden *Yellow Shard, Reverse Candy, HP Up, Thick Club,
Calcium,* and *Green Shard* as you head up. At the top is an
*Everstone,* as well as interactable Cacturne*.*

Turn around and head up the second (from the west) rock climb to explore
the northern side of the desert. If you want to return to the city,
Claydol is your man.

ZCell 086: Zorrialyn Desert

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image89.png"
style="width:6.61458in;height:4.96875in" />

Hidden in this area you'll find *Petaya Berry, Occa Berry,* and *Haban
Berry.*

To the east, catch the Shiny Cacturne if you'd like and pick up the
hidden *Rare Bone*, then head back down.

As you go east, there is a hidden *Ether* and *Green Shard.* Down from
here:

ZCell 087: Zorrialyn Desert (Night Only)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image90.png"
style="width:6.64583in;height:4.94792in" />

Head across the bridge and grab the *Hyper Potion*. There is also a
hidden *Green Shard.*

This one's a bit hard to spot:

ZCell 088: Zorrialyn Desert (Night Only)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image91.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.01042in" />

Grab the hidden *Big Root, Ether, Lemonade, Reverse Candy,* as you head
east.

Heading east will lead us to another rock climb. Head all the way up and
then right to get a *Smooth Rock*. Grab:

ZCell 089: Zorrialyn Desert

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image92.png"
style="width:6.61458in;height:4.98958in" />

Head back down then go east, and we'll have completed the loop. Next,
we're gonna check out the map in the very southeast of the desert.

Zorrialyn Desert (Next to Poiloethal Forest)

Grab the *Revive* here, and the *Iron* at the bottom. Also hidden here
is *Max Repel, Ground Gem, Kebia Berry, Poison Gem, Ether,* and *Ultra
Ball.* Not much else we can do here. Don't go to the west or you'll lose
money!

Head back to the main desert, go all the way to the left, and go south
at the oasis.

Zorrialyn Coast (Southwest)

|                          |          |                    |          |

Head down, then grab the *Escape Rope.* Go up to the top of this area,
where the cave is being blocked. To the right:

ZCell 090: Zorrialyn Coast

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image93.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:4.96875in" />

Hidden around this map you'll find 2 *Dusk Balls, Rock Gem, Red Shard,
Ground Gem, Poke Doll, Heart Scale, Elixir,* and *Water Gem.* Don't head
to the east, again, you'll lose money. We will cover the cave accessible
to the south and the nearby house later on.

Finally, head to the west and cross the bridges, and watch your
respective cutscene.

If you're on the Kanon + Claydol path, now's the proper time you're
heading to the Voidal Chasm. Explore using the section above if you'd
like, keeping in mind you're going backwards: go to B3F of Voidal Chasm.
Now's your fight with the hooded figure. Beat him, then outside, talk to
the crew, then make your way back to this part of the desert.

Cross the bridges and enter the village.

## Sashila Village 1st Visit

Head up the first set of stairs. The door to the right serves as our
PC/healing site, should you need it.

Talk to the girl on the second level here, and she'll give you some lore
in exchange for some cash. There is also a Level 75 Audino Breeder here.
You'll get 3 *Exp. Candy XL* every time you win. Head up.

Sashila Shop

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Ultra Ball* $1200

*Mineral Ball* $1200

*Hyper Potion* $1200

*Max Repel* $700

*Burn Heal* $250

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Reverse Candy* $50

Head all the way to the top. We can surf here. Do so on the left side,
and you'll find:

ZCell 091: Sashila Village

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image94.png"
style="width:6.67708in;height:5.01042in" />

Enter the building here and talk to a guy inside for a *House Key.* Back
outside, there are tons of hidden items all around this map:

*HP Up* nearby, a *Link Heart* by surfing to the right and going down,
and *GourmetTreat, Lemonade, Max Repel, Grass Gem,* and *Moon Stone* in
the main body of land in town.

To start a little quest, exit Sashila to the east and go all the way
down. Attempt to use the key we just got on the house here, and it will
break. We'll be back later.

Back at the top of the village, talk to Damien and Alexandra in their
room. Then, head to the inn and talk to the innkeeper. After a brief
cutscene, it's time for a change-up!

## Hospital of Ruin (1st Visit)

Time for another section where we get to control a different character.
Exit your room and leave to the left. Talk to the elevator, and head
down the shaft.

Head down to talk to the computer at the bottom of the shaft, then head
up. Interact with the B1 door to listen in on a conversation. Then, head
up to 1F and exit the shaft. In the rightmost room of the floor, read
all the computer files in the office.

Back down in the shaft, type 8433 in the console at the bottom.

Down here, enter the room on the left, then press the panel. Enter the
room at the top and talk to Braixen. Head to the bottom-right and follow
the path.

Choose whether to follow Giratina, then fight the grunts. The outcome
doesn't matter here, but it's winnable if you can get lucky with an
Ancient Power boost or Braixen living to put Muk to sleep.

Anyways, after the battle, the scenes will finish playing out… Dark.

## Sashila Village 2nd Visit

As soon as you regain control, let's continue the story.

If you're on the Bladestar kidnap route, head to talk to Alexandra at
the very top of the village.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I wish for peace. (Ren +1, Alexandra +3, Ryland +1)

- I don't know... (Ren +2, Alexandra -1, Ryland -1)

- ... (Ren -1, Alexandra -1, Ryland -1)

Relationship Point Choices:
- Alright... (Ren +1, Alexandra +1)

- No Thanks. (Ren -1)

If you're on the Kanon route, talk to Ren at the bottom of the village.

Either way, head to Alamissa Urben, located halfway east on the lower
loop of the desert.

## Alamissa Urben

Talk to Ren at the entrance and you'll get **Sylveon,** as well as the
*Mysterious Black Box.* I recommend training this Sylveon up, with the
Misty Terrain move, and you'll see why in a few sections.

Alamissa Urben

|                |          |
|----------------|----------|
| Cave    | % |
| Claydol        | 30       |

| Cufant         | 10       |
| **Copperajah** | 5        |

Rock Smash all the rocks that you can along the way - they'll
permanently be gone, leaving you shortcuts for the area.

The first area contains a hidden *Red Shard.* Follow the door to the
left, beat the grunt, and exit. Grab the *Red Flute* below. A *Yellow
Shard* and another 3 *Red Shards* are hidden in this area. Follow the
ladder down and beat the grunt.

Outside there are 3 hidden *Yellow Shards.* The middle section is just
two optional battles, so beat them if you'd like and enter the door on
the right side. Beat the grunt representing the amazing power of Gen 4
bug types, then head up the ladder.

Hidden around here and down are two *Yellow Shards.* Enter the bottom
ladder and exit the right door: you'll find another hidden *Yellow
Shard* and a **Falinks.** Back up the ladder, head up and then right.

Via the nearby door you'll find a *Power Bracer.* Behind the grunt is a
*Poke Toy.* Head up and you'll find, surprise, 3 more hidden *Yellow
Shards.*

Talk to the group up at the top, then head to the left. On the left side
of the area you can find 7 hidden *Red Shards.* Grab the *Poke Toy* at
the bottom, then the *Prism Scale* inside a door.

Return to the top, find a final hidden *Yellow Shard,* and enter the
gallery.

Beat the grunts with the assistance of Ren, then watch the scene…

## Blakeory Atheneum Tour

Aww yeah, another different character section. Basically, you're gonna
be fighting your way to the stairs of the library. The trainers aren't
too hard.

Talk to the computer at the top of the second column. After you get
control, talk to Erin downstairs. Here depending on your status with
Melia you'll gain Relationship Points with Erin:

If you have at least 45, you'll get (+6 Erin).

Else, if you have at least 10, you'll get (+2 Erin).

Else if you have less than 0, you'll get (-6 Erin).

Then, head upstairs and talk to the Youngster for a battle. Talk to Erin
again. Once you regain control, enter the arena.

Battle Erin! Though, win or lose, the game will continue. Finish
watching the wholesome scene and proceed.

## Aevium (Past) 3rd Visit

*Max Revive.* Nothing to do in the Mysterious Manor for now, so head
north into Hiyoshi City!

*Exp. Candy M.*

From the south entrance to Hiyoshi City, enter the first apartment door
on the right. Hidden in here is an *Ultra Potion.*

Once you're ready, follow Hazuki in the northwest of the city, then head
into the house via the secret tunnel and talk to Nymiera. Talk to Huey
in the corner to get some crazy backstory.

Exit the house and enter the building above with the PC. Hidden in here
is an *Ether.* Talk to the group in the southwest area of town. Then,
head north to board the truck to Hiyoshi Pass.

Grab the *TM27 Return* on the right.

When you head up, be prepared for a battle… and another change of pace.
We'll be playing as Ren now!

-   Xurkitree, Level 80. @ Shuca Berry.

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Grass Knot

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Hidden Power Ice

First time we're using Ren's team, luckily, it's not too awful. Greninja
can beat Raichu and dent Xurkitree, leaving the rest of the team to fill
in the gaps. This one is optional, but winning grants (+1 Ren)
Relationship Points.

So yeah, we'll be playing as Ren, and any captures we make will go to
our main character's PC. Nice.

Head to the south-central square in town. After the scene, head to the
Hiyoshi Pass again. Attempt to enter Rejuvenation Co., then head back to
the city. Talk to the woman directly above the truck, then head to Route
5.

Head west as soon as you can on Route 5 and talk to Anastasia, then
enter Rejuvenation Co. by beating the guards.

In the building, head west and follow the path, beating all the
trainers.

After the sequence of events, return to Nymiera's house. Talk to the
nurse in the inn, then head to the north part of town to engage with the
maids. Head straight south. Beat the maids, then return to the inn one
more time. Enter the tunnel, we're going in. Make your way to the back.

We get control of our character again! Return to the tunnel. We're gonna
be pushing strength boulders onto the spiked platforms. As soon as you
get to the first healing star, grab the *Focus Sash* to the left and
press the button on the pillar.

Optimistic Guy Huey (Dimensional Rift Field)

-   Octillery, Level 78. @ Leftovers.

    -   Protect

    -   Hydro Pump

    -   Ice Beam

    -   Fire Blast

-   Flareon, Level 79. @ Rift Seed.

    -   Flare Blitz

    -   Superpower

    -   Double-Edge

    -   Quick Attack

Easy one. Continue north.

Trendy Girl Reina (Dimensional Rift Field)

-   Ribombee, Level 75. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Sticky Web

    -   Nature Power

    -   Stun Spore

    -   Bug Buzz

-   Honchkrow, Level 76. @ Scope Lens.

    -   Night Slash

    -   Brave Bird

    -   Superpower

    -   Sucker Punch

-   Swoobat, Level 78. @ Rift Seed.

    -   Psychic

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Air Slash

    -   Calm Mind

Another easy one, just make sure you don't get swept by Honchkrow.

Head up and through, grabbing the *Rift Notes for Code: Angelus*. Oh
boy.

Angel of Death Gardevoir (Dimensional Field)

-   Angel of Death Gardevoir, Level 80. @ Lum Berry. Type: Dark/Fairy.
    Ability: Execution. Stats: 300/200/150/180/200/145.

> 4 Shields.

-   Lovely Kiss

-   Hyperspace Hole

-   Sacred Sword

-   Dark Pulse

This one is tough. This time, you must break *four* shields just to get
to be able to whittle its HP down. It loves to put you to sleep, thanks
to its speed, it's gonna be able to easily do so. It has a Lum Berry, so
you need to hit it with Burn, Paralysis, or Poison twice just to get it
to stick. It also has both physical and special moves, so again lowering
both stats might be key. I recommend Memento as at least you will be
able to live a Night Slash or Hyperspace Hole with most Pokemon
afterwards. Break the shields efficiently and then hammer it hard,
preferably with Poison or Steel type physical moves. Alternatively, you
can nullify the field and Gardevoir's advantagex with Pyukumuku's Purify
- then Sylveon can set up Misty Terrain, allowing you to knock it out
with field-boosted Fairy moves.

After defeating it, depending on our choice in a previous past segment,
you'll get relationship points here:

If Cop saved - (Ren +3, Reina +3, Huey +3, Venam +3)  
If Maria "saved" - (Ren +3, Reina +3, Huey +3)

Dimensional Rift Gardevoir Round 2 (Dimensional Field)

-   Fallen Angel Gardevoir, Level 80. @ Lum Berry. Type: Dark/Fairy.
    Ability: Execution. Stats: 180/130/100/100/100/240.

    -   Lovely Kiss

    -   Hyperspace Hole

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Sacred Sword

A far easier round 2, plus, Ren will fight with you. If you could do the
first this one will be easy.

… … … Well. Once you get control back, head to Nymiera's house once
again. Push the button on the back of the bookcase!

## VS. Ren, Sashila Help Quests

Talk to the group, then again on top of the village. Head out to the
coastline and talk to Alexandra in front of the obelisk. After the
scene, we're gonna head west across the bridge for a battle with Ren! At

A very, very tough singles battle, though nothing you've never seen
before. Beat him with a better team!

Next, it's time for some Help Quests. Enter the door in the middle of
Sashila Village, on the left side.

    Marten.

-   In the Voidal Chasm, pick up the shiny object on B2F.

-   Return to Marten, then meet him in Hyu'ro's house.

-   Rock smash your way in, then, pick up a hidden on the left side of
    the second building from the left, and then enter the leftmost door
    of this house.

    grab *Relic Copper.* In the right door, grab *Rare Candy.*

-   Head back to the top of the village and go around the back of the
    first house on the right cliff. Pick up a hidden *Ground Gem, Green
    Shard,* and *Protein.* Inside, you'll find *Relic Silver.*

-   There's nothing in the right house, so head to the center of the
    city and go down. Hidden down here is a *Wacan Berry* as well as a
    *Super Repel.* Enter the house on the right. Grab the *Relic
    Copper.* With Blast Powder, you can get:

ZCell 093: Ruined City

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image96.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5in" />

-   Prepare yourself and enter the southwest house. Beat the first set
    of grunts, then head out to heal. The next one is tough.

-   Beat the grunts in their 8v6 double battle.

-   Make your choice with Damien.

> Relationship Point Choices:*

HQuest 30: I need to get Stronger!

-   Meet Novae at the bottom of the village. It's battle time…

Wanderer Novae (Desert Field)

-   Ninetales, Level 79. @ Charcoal.

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Solar Beam

    -   Nasty Plot

    -   Will-O-Wisp

-   Exeggutor, Level 79. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Energy Ball

    -   Psyshock

    -   Sleep Powder

    -   Hidden Power Fire

-   Lycanroc, Level 80. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Drill Run

    -   Accelerock

    -   Protect

-   Tsareena, Level 81. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Power Whip

    -   Knock Off

    -   Play Rough

    -   Hi Jump Kick

-   Sandslash, Level 81. @ Life Orb.

    -   Earthquake

    -   Stomping Tantrum

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Knock Off

-   Passimian, Level 82. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Iron Head

    -   Close Combat

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Seed Bomb

Compared to some of her earlier fights, this isn't that bad. She uses a
standard desert-based sun team, meant to catch your leads off guard with
sleep + heat wave. If you can change up the weather, you'll be golden.
Alternatively, fighting fire with fire works well here, as only her own
Ninetales and the frail Lycanroc resist your own Heat Wave. If you got
here with your double battle ability, you could do one more.

-   Return to the help center to get $32500 and a *Scented Lure.* (+1
    Karma).

## Sand Stream Cave

You can return to GDC now if you want, but there's even more desert
exploration and quests we can do!

Next, we're gonna enter Sand Stream Cave. In Sashila, head to the top,
and surf to the east (on the opposite side of the research lab). Talk to
a guy here, then exit and go north from Zorrialyn Coast.

Sand Stream Cave

|                |          |
|----------------|----------|
| Cave    | % |
| Silicobra      | 35       |
| **Hippopotas** | 30       |
| Diggersby      | 29       |
| **Sandile**    | 4        |
| **Krokorok**   | 1        |
| **Sandaconda** | 1        |

Grab the Hyper Potion up here. Hidden in this first room is 2 *Yellow
Shards, Carbos, Escape Rope, Berry Juice,* and *Grass Gem.*

Now, exit the cave. Re-enter, and check for a stationary Hippopotas to
the left. If it is not there, exit and enter again. Repeat this until
we're good, then take the northwest quicksand vortex to B1F.
Alternatively, just wait until nighttime for guaranteed odds.

Enter the vortex in the sand pit. Grab the *Revive* here on B2F and find
a hidden *Red Shard*, then another *Revive* and hidden *Green Shard* and
*Rare Candy* past some Rock Climbs. In the center of the room is a
hidden *Light Clay.* Grab the *Full Heal,* hidden *Burn Heal, Clever
Wing, Genius Wing,* and non-hidden *Moon Ball* along the path. There are
tons of wild **Hippowdon** roaming around down here as well.

Take the vortex to B3F!

Sand Stream Depths

|             |          |
|-------------|----------|
| Cave | % |
| Silicobra   | 35       |
| Hippopotas  | 30       |
| Diggersby   | 29       |
| Hippowdon   | 5        |
| Sandaconda  | 1        |

Hidden in this room is a *Green Shard, Soft Sand, Rock Gem, Rawst Berry,
Sitrus Berry, Berry Juice* and *Lava Cookie.*

Interact with the space in the ground here and put in the Scented Lure.
Then, you'll be able to catch **Trapinch** and **Vibrava!** Grab the
MegaStone *Sandacondanite.*

That's all there is to do in that cave for now!

## Zorrialyn Labyrinth 1<sup>st</sup> Visit

Next, we're going to do some treasure hunting. Head down south of
Zorrialyn Coast, and you'll see a cave entrance.

Time to explore: Zorrialyn Labyrinth.

I'm basically gonna list the paths I took in this section that led me to
all the items. Every time you reach a junction, proceed to the next
direction listed. You'll need to return multiple times.

B1F

Trip One: URDRRDL, grab *PP Max.* Then, RDLDDL, grab *Relic Copper.*
LUL, Battle with wild **Cofagrigus** and proceed. UU, grab *HP Up.*
Then, DD, L all the way to a dead end, grab *Relic Copper.* RUUR, grab
*Relic Copper*. LUUR, Battle, ULU, and in. Grab the *Magcargo Crest!*
Exit this room, then go DR, Battle, RULULD, grab *Relic Copper.* UL,
enter and grab *Seviper Crest.* It kicked me out shortly after.

2: ULLUULULULD, grab *Dread Plate.* URU, but don't go in as there is
nothing there. RURDRU (around the big crack), pick up a *Heart Scale.*
RD, pick up a *Meadow Plate.* URU, pick up an *Icicle Plate.* RUR,
follow the path pick up a *Dread Plate.* Back at the first junction
backtracking out of this path, DRDLDL, pick up an *Insect Plate.*
Booted!

3: ULD, then L all the way to a dead end, Battle. Rock Smash left and
interact with the wall and use Strength. From the junction: U, R all the
way, D, R again ALL the way, battle, finish going R all the way, DL.
Grab the *Oricorio Crest* inside the door*.* Exit, RUULU, take the
ladder. Now, we've made it to Floor 2. Repeat just the strength wall
interaction and take the ladder to return to B2F.

B2F

1: DRU, grab *Toxic Plate.* DL, D all the way, LU, in. Get the *Stantler
Crest.* Exit, then go RUULLLU, grab *Fist Plate.* DRRUUL, U all the way,
LURD, grab *Flame Plate*. Nothing in the door above, so L, U all the
way, RD for an *Iron Plate.* U, L all the way until a door. Inside is a
*Hypno Crest.* Exit, LLDR, to get *Earth Plate.* LDDRDRU, into a door.
Get *Fearow Crest.* I got booted here.

2: RDR, then talk to and defeat/catch the Cofagrigus. L all the way, U,
L all the way. Down all the way. Grab the *Carbos* here, but DON'T read
the wall, or you'll have to go fight Cofagrigus again. LURU, take the
ladder. Repeat just the Cofagrigus encounter and take the ladder to
return to B3F.

B3F

1: DLU, get *Relic Silver*. DRURULU, get *Stone Plate.* Down Left Up and
in to get *Leafeon Crest.* Exit, DLURUL, pick up *Relic Silver.* Rock
Smash here, UURUR, pick up a *Sky Plate.* Booted!

2: DRURURURU, grab the *Sky Plate* here. UULL, pick up *Stone Plate*.
RU, head in for a *Glaceon Crest.* Exit, RRULU, pick up *Relic Copper*.
D, R all the way, D for *Relic Copper.* Up Left Up for *Spooky Plate.*

This is all we can do for now in the labyrinth! We'll be back here not
too long from now.

That covers the quests and available content in the Badlands, for now.

## Grand Dream Tournament

Talk to Damien at the top of Sashila and head back to Route 9. There,
you'll get *HM02 Fly!* Finally. If you have the Golden Wings you can use
these now!

Technically this opens us up to return to Floria and Terajuma… which
means there are tons of new areas and quests that open up. I cover these
in the next chapter, though you are able to do some of them now if you'd
like.

When you're ready, hop on the Route 9 train headed to the Tournament
Stadium. Enter the building. Talk to Erin at the desk, then to the
attendant.

GDC Tournament Shop

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Ultra Ball* $1200

*Super Potion* $700

*Hyper Potion* $1200

*Ultra Potion* $2200

*Awakening* $250

*GourmetTreat* $1500

*Reverse Candy* $50

*Repel* $350

*Super Repel* $500

*Max Repel* $700

Head in and into the door on the left. When you're ready, talk to the
guy at the right. We'll be playing a 3v3 tournament. Each battle, minus
the last, will be played on a random field. So, that's interesting. The
trainers aren't too hard to beat, but so you're aware of their
strategies, here they are:

-   Rain Team

-   FEAR/Sturdy Shenanigans

-   Extreme Evo-boost -\> Pass -\> Stored Power

You'll then get to play as Melia for a quick second. Head into the Grand
Dream Ball.

The next 3 battles are as follows:

-   Standard heavy offense with a Z-move

-   Residual damage/stall

-   Fast and hard damage

After some scenes, you'll get a treat from Tesla.

The next set of battles:

-   Nothing special

-   Nothing special: Salazzle Edition

So, beat all eight of these fools and watch the following cutscene…

## Rugged Badge

Gym Leader Adam (Inverse Field)

-   Tyranitar, Level 80. @ Magical Seed.

    -   Dragon Dance

    -   Earthquake

    -   Crunch

    -   Matrix Shot

-   Aurorus, Level 78. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Hyper Voice

    -   Earth Power

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Flash Cannon

-   Crustle, Level 79. @ Custap Berry.

    -   X Scissor

    -   Shell Smash

    -   Slash and Burn

    -   Matrix Shot

-   Kabutops, Level 79. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Matrix Shot

    -   Slash and Burn

    -   Waterfall

    -   X Scissor

-   Gigalith, Level 78. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Dragon Dance

    -   Earthquake

    -   Crunch

    -   Matrix Shot

-   Aerodactyl, Level 83. @ Aerodactylite.

    -   Return

    -   Slash and Burn

    -   Ice Fang

    -   Matrix Shot

Matrix Shot: Rock \| Physical \| 90 power \| 100% accuracy \| Uses the
target's Special Defense stat instead of the Defense stat in the damage
calculation.

The Tyranitar is a tank on this field. Basically, it turns Normal type,
and all its moves are turned to Normal type as well, adding to their
damage. That, plus its single weakness now being Ghost, you're gonna
struggle with killing it. His Kabutops is also tough to beat if it gets
a Weak Armor speed boost. Otherwise, it's not the hardest battle in the
world if you can account for the Inverse Field. Fire moves hit
everything except Crustle and Tyranitar super effectively here - just
watch out for the X-Scissor and Slash and Burn moves here and there. I
also recommend using your own Magical Seeds - it will turn even
type-disadvantaged mons into super-effective titans, crushing with
Normalized moves.

Win to get the Rugged Badge, which lets us use Dive and go up to Level
85. You'll also get *TM80 Rock Slide.* Nice.

# Chapter 14: Death of One, Birth of Another

## Neo Gearen City + Side Quests

Relationship Point Choices

- Reassure Amber. (Amber +2)  
- Leave her be. (No change.)

After the cutscenes play out, head back outside. Talk to the crew in the
lobby, then outside.

Before we board the ship, there are a TON of side quests that have
opened on the other islands we haven't been able to visit for a while.
Skip to the next section if you want to just progress the story. This
section is all doable just before the tournament arc, so if you did this
part already you can skip to the next for V12 content.

We can fly now! If you have the Golden Wings, use them, otherwise, teach
fly to a Pidgey or something.

Fly to Evergreen Forest, and head up. Rock Climb here, then use Strength
to get to the top. Here, you'll find an *Ice Memory* and have a chance
to catch **Sneasel**! Towards the top of the area, surf across a pond,
climb some rocks and use Strength again to pick up MegaStone *Audinite!*
Make your way to the spring. Battle and catch “The Emperor”
(**Empoleon**). Back outside the forest, talk to Nana in her house for a
*King's Rock!*

Head to North Evergreen Cave. Melt the ice again with a move like Lava
Plume to get to the top. Push the boulder into this hole. On the next
floor, you need to push it into the rightmost hole… unfortunately this
is the farthest one away. On the next floor, navigate it all the way
around to the hole on the bottom. Once you push it down, follow it. Fish
in this newly opened spot to catch **Feebas!**

Next, fly to Kakori, and head down to the depths of the gym. Using
strength in the backroom, you'll get *TM106 Irritation.*

In Terajuma Jungle, If you've picked up the T.M.'s for Hail, Sunny Day,
and Rain Dance, show them to the guy in front of the weather institute
to get the *Castform Crest* and *TM128 Weather Ball.*

Enter Aquamarine Cave next: in the chamber room, surf up and talk to
**Squirtle.** Give it a GourmetTreat for a battle.

Go to Kristiline Town next. The T.M. shop has updated wares:

Kristiline T.M. Shop New Items (12+ Badges)

*RM01 Hone Claws* $150000

*RM05 Sucker Punch* $100000

*TM116 Mega Kick* $150000

*TM125 Charm* $15000

*TM155 Eerie Impulse* $15000

Next, we're heading to Lost Camp. If you've completed all three parts of
this quest so far, enter Maman's house and go upstairs. After some
scenes, you'll get **Starly,** and (+999 Mosely) Relationship Points.
Yes, seriously.

Enter the Locksmith's house in Akuwa Town. Show him our broken key. If
you have 2 Light Clay and 1 Hard Stone, he'll make us a *Reforged Key!*
Nice. Fly back to Sashila and attempt to enter the house on the
coastline. Hidden on the first floor is a *Yellow Shard, Blue Shard,*
and a *Red Shard.* Head upstairs and talk to the girl and pick up a
hidden *Poke Doll.* Interact with the hook downstairs and place the
family portrait. Then, head around to the left and go downstairs to get
MegaStone *Gardevoirite.*

Fly to Goldenleaf Town and enter Wispy Ruins through the statue. Head
into the 4-way junction and go right, then, push the strength boulder
onto the platform. Enter, and follow the path up to the 9-badge gate.
Talk to the treasure chest for a battle with **Gastly!**

Enter the Lost Castle and make your way straight to the back. If you've
opened all 9 of the badge gate chests, head in to get the *Vespiquen
Crest,* and *TM61 Will-o-Wisp.*

Next, head to Wispy Tower. Head around the back via Strength to get
*Reaper Cloth!*

Exit, and make your way to Sheridan Village. Enter Carotos via the
waterfall entrance and make your way to the second room. Cross the
bridge to the right, use Blast Powder, and use strength to get beyond.

Carotos Pokemon Seller

**Happiny** 6 Blue Shards

**Joltik** 6 Yellow Shards

**Charmander** 10 Red Shards

Furfrou 8 Yellow Shards

“Pikachu” (**Mimikyu)** 7 Yellow Shards

Buy all of them to get *Fire Memory* and (+5 Karma).

Head to the Amethyst Grotto. Using Strength, get *TM22 Solarbeam.*

Next, fly to Rose Theater and use the Time Splicer Stone. Head to
Sheridan Village, then cut down the pink sapling in front of the
village. Make your way back to the present.

Next, we're gonna fly to West Gearen City. Head into the house with the
red door on the south side of town. If you've beat all the virtual gym
leaders, accept the challenge to the virtual E4. You can “take a break”
after each win: if you do, you can save between each member.

Elite Four Will (Glitch Field)

-   Jynx, Level 51. @ Ice Gem.

    -   Lovely Kiss

    -   Psychic

    -   Blizzard

    -   Thief

-   Exeggutor, Level 51. @ Occa Berry.

    -   Leech Seed

    -   Sleep Powder

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Psychic

-   Espeon, Level 52. @ Twisted Spoon.

    -   Psychic

    -   Yawn

    -   Bite

    -   Hidden Power Fire

-   Slowbro, Level 51. @ Chesto Berry.

    -   Belly Drum

    -   Rest

    -   Drain Punch

    -   Sleep Talk

-   Slowking, Level 52. @ Iron Ball.

    -   Fling

    -   Thunder Wave

    -   Dragon Tail

    -   Psychic

-   Xatu, Level 53. @ Heat Rock.

    -   Sunny Day

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Solarbeam

    -   Psychic

I again will cover this as on the Cyndaquil path. This one isn't too
bad, though in general you must watch out for field boosted Psychic. A
bit of luck in dodging sleep allows Typhlosion to knock out Jynx and
Exeggutor, and Miltank and Jolteon can easily handle Espeon, Slowbro,
and Slowking with a combination of healing and attacking. The rest of
your Pokemon should be able to fill in the gaps.

Elite Four Koga (Glitch Field)

-   Forretress, Level 53. @ Zoom Lens.

    -   Toxic Spikes

    -   Spikes

    -   Zap Cannon

    -   Explosion

-   Muk, Level 54. @ Black Sludge.

    -   Fire Blast

    -   Venoshock

    -   Sleep Talk

    -   Rest

-   Weezing, Level 54. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Toxic Spikes

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Venoshock

-   Qwilfish, Level 55. @ Payapa Berry.

    -   Fell Stinger

    -   Venoshock

    -   Hydro Pump

    -   Toxic Spikes

-   Ariados, Level 55. @ Focus Band.

    -   Sucker Punch

    -   Megahorn

    -   Venoshock

    -   Stomping Tantrum

-   Crobat, Level 56. @ Leftovers.

    -   Toxic

    -   Double Team

    -   Roost

    -   Heat Wave

It can be very tempting to start setting up Curse with Steelix, but Koga
has a lot of Fire / Water special coverage, so you probably want to
Stealth Rock then bail. Keeping Qwilfish alive is useful to nullify all
Toxic Spikes here, unfortunately it doesn't really help much other than
setting up your own spikes if you want to cripple Muk, Qwilfish, and
Ariados. Luckily Jolteon can easily take Crobat if you don't let it
Double Team too much, and Typhlosion, Gliscor, and Steelix can find ways
to deal with everything else easily.

Elite Four Bruno (Glitch Field)

-   Golem, Level 54. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Rock Polish

    -   Metronome

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Earthquake

-   Granbull, Level 55. @ Leftovers.

    -   Lovely Kiss

    -   Return

    -   Fire Blast

    -   Metronome

-   Kangaskhan, Level 54. @ Metronome.

    -   Blizzard

    -   Fire Blast

    -   Hyper Beam

    -   Power Up Punch

-   Hitmonchan, Level 56. @ Expert Belt.

    -   Drain Punch

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Metronome

-   Hitmonlee, Level 57. @ Choice Scarf.

    -   Metronome

    -   Metronome

    -   Metronome

    -   Metronome

-   Machamp, Level 57. @ Payapa Berry.

    -   Metronome

    -   Dynamic Punch

    -   Stone Edge

    -   Fire Blast

The good news is, a lot of his team centers around Metronome, so this
might be the easiest fight yet. The bad news is, his team centers around
Metronome, which only picks strong moves on this field! So, you might be
extremely *unlucky.* Gliscor is a good choice to wear out the fighting
types, as well as Golem. Steelix is useless other than Stealth Rocks
here unfortunately. Miltank and Jolteon are a bit less useful but can
still help by crippling Granbull and Kangaskhan. Once Gliscor goes down,
Qwilfish with Intimidate and Typhlosion should be able to ride out the
fight.

Elite Four Karen (Glitch Field)

-   Alolan Persian, Level 55. @ Mental Herb.

    -   Throat Chop

-   Umbreon, Level 58. @ Leftovers.

    -   Rest

    -   Sleep Talk

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Toxic

This one is tough! Two Gyro Balls will knock out Persian luckily, and
Miltank can barely take out Tyranitar. Vileplume goes down to
Typhlosion, and if you save Gliscor for Houndoom, you can one-shot it.
Unfortunately, the Umbreon is a pain in the ass to take out - I
recommend Knocking Off its item with Gliscor and using everything you
have left to make sure it can't rest. Steelix can't get poisoned, so
getting off a couple curses might be your best bet. You can always reset
if things go south.

-   Dragonite, Level 60. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Agility

    -   Outrage

    -   Fire Blast

    -   Hyper Beam

A fitting challenge to end this quest! Exeggutor can two shot pretty
much your whole team, Aerodactyl can get a free knock out with Glitch
Field Hyper Beam, and his other Pokemon have immense coverage. The good
news: everything past his lead is weak to stealth rocks! So, use Steelix
to get those out, then let Jolteon hit Exeggutor and Dragonite with 4x
effective Hidden Power. Qwilfish helped me weaken Lapras and Gliscor
finished it, leaving Miltank and Typhlosion to carefully deal with the
rest of the team. It's tough, but you can do it.

If you succeed, you'll get the corresponding crest to your starter in
the challenge: the *Meganium Crest*, *Typhlosion Crest*, or *Feraligatr
Crest*! You'll also get 25 AP Points and your fourth department store
stamp!

On Junction Bridge, push a boulder out of the way - now that we have the
Dull Key, open the door here and use a GourmetTreat to get **Litten!**

Next, head east through Neo Gearen City (I'll cover this revamped area
later!) to Route 2.

Route 2 (Altered)

|              |          |                 |          |                 |          |

On the left you'll find a hidden *Rose Incense.*

Enter the factory in the middle of the route to get a *Grass Memory* as
well as *Research Notes.* Exit through the left door and grab the *Dusk
Stone* and hidden *Blue Shard* and *Rare Candy.*

You'll also find:

ZCell 094: Route 2 (Altered)

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image97.PNG"
style="width:6.63542in;height:4.98567in"
alt="A picture containing colorful Description automatically generated" />

Return to the past again and give the guy on Route 2 some research notes
so he'll finally move out of the way. At night only, you can get:

ZCell 095: Route 2

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image98.png"
style="width:6.61458in;height:5.01042in" />

Also, you can catch **Whimsicott** here (ignore the Flabebe from an
earlier patch).

Talk to Kecleon in the middle of the route. He'll offer to sell the two
crests that correspond to the starters we did NOT choose in the virtual
league. He'll sell the *Meganium Crest, Typhlosion Crest,* and
*Feraligatr Crest* for $250000 each. Steep, but worth it if you are
using any of these three and didn't get their crest via the virtual
league quest.

As you've probably noticed, East Gearen City looks brand new. Fly there!

There are new trainers to fight and items on each map. The one
containing the lab has a hidden *GourmetTreat, Yellow Shard, Resist
Wing, Elemental Seed, Super Potion, Red Shard,* and 2 *Grass Gems.* The
right contains a *Resist Wing, Heart Scale, TinyMushroom, Repel,* and
*Antidote.*

Enter the lab and talk to Jan. Then, head outside and talk to Adrienn
again.

Enter the sewers with Adrienn. Hidden on this map is 2 *Red Shards,* 2
*Blue Shards, Zinc, Potion.* Follow Adrienn into the next room, and pick
up the hidden *Blue Shard* and *Green Shard.* Next, go to the upper
right room.

Emerge on the east side of Gearen and meet Adrienn and Aya in the middle
of the city.

We have our new directive: help quests. Before that though, check out
Gearen Park if you want.

Hidden here is 2 *Honey, Leaf Stone, Carbos, Muscle Wing, Blue Shard,*
and *Yellow Shard.*

Catch a Level 100 Budew (or catch something close and Rare Candy it to
100). Then, show it to the guy at the bottom for ZCrystal *Grassium-Z.*

Speaking of Budew, add Aevian Budew to your party and head up to the
library. Upstairs, talk to Zumi, who will reward us with 10 *Exp. Candy
L* and MegaStone *Ampharosite!* Our final task for her is to catch a
Pokemon found later on at Axis University.

Enter the Help Center. If you've been keeping track of Zygarde Cells (At
least 70), talk to the researchers to get *Lucky Egg*!

HQuest 31: Poke Ball Conundrum

-   Enter the Everglade Mall and speak to the clerk at the Poke Ball
    shop.

-   Attempt to enter the door at the Tecanlite Factory in West Gearen.
    Head down, and Aya will let you in.

-   Beat the goons at the entrance. Pick up all the balls you see
    around!

-   Enter the door towards the left of the floor and get the *Tecanlite
    Key.* Use it on the door at the top to pick up *TM24 Thunderbolt!*

-   Back in the main area, use the Key at the top of the floor, then
    follow the path through to the right.

-   Beat the Death Wings - they use exclusively Steel and Water types.

-   Return to the Help Center to get your reward - $12356, and ZCrystal
    *Aloraichium-Z.* (+1 Karma)

-   Now, return to the Poke Ball shop to get 15 *Ultra Balls.* We'll
    also again be able to buy balls here - nothing we couldn't before
    however.

HQuest 32: Forest Restoration

-   Meet at the Route 1 Train Station.

-   Talk to Adrienn in front of where we fought Gyarados (remember
    that?)

-   We're gonna need to submit 3 workers, 1 Scyther, and $48000. Go
    ahead and submit the money when you have it.

-   Fly to Kakori Village and enter the Jeminra Woods Safari Zone.
    You'll see **Scyther** here now, so catch two (one to keep).

-   Worker 1: Community room in Goldenleaf Town.

-   Worker 2: Xen Battleship at the Terajuma shore, right person in
    sleeping chambers.

-   Worker 3: House below therapist in Kristiline Town.

-   Return to Adrienn and hand over the Scyther, then ask to see
    Progress.

-   We're gonna need $58000, 1 Architect, and 3 Fishermen. Submit the
    money.

-   Fisherman 1: On a bench east of the East Gearen to Route 1 Station.

-   Fisherman 2: On Route 2, directly south of the Amethyst Cave
    entrance.

-   Fisherman 3: In Aquamarine Cave, via the lighthouse path. While
    you're in the Rock Climb area, talk to the worker and give him
    Protein. If you do, he will give you **Tyrogue!** Anyways, you'll
    find the fisherman after you go up the ladder.

-   Architect: Bridge guy in Terajuma Jungle - first left from Kakori.

-   Return to Adrienn and inquire about progress.

-   Next, we'll need to submit $68000, 7 Tiny Mushrooms, 1 bag of
    Stardust, and 1 Poliwag.

-   If you haven't completed the Poliwag search quest, do so now. Feel
    free to submit that one if you have it, or, if its evolved, breed
    it. Note that finishing this quest will let us catch more Poliwag,
    so don't worry if this is your only one.

-   I had both the mushrooms and the stardust, but if not, go grind them
    off Paras/Staryu, respectively. Compoundeyes and Thief/Covet will
    make the job easy.

-   Submit it all to Adrienn.

-   Pick: *2 Lum Berries, 2 Salac Berries, 2 Lansat Berries, 1 Enigma
    Berry, 2 Starf Berries,* and pick up the *Bug Memory.*

-   Talk to Adrienn at the top. Beat the Deathwing.

-   Return to Grand Hall and talk to Adrienn. Enter the basement and
    take a right.

-   After the scene, exit this room and enter the room on the right at
    the bottom, and grab ZCrystal *Normalium-Z.*

-   Return to the help center to get (back) $250000, and MegaStone
    *Mawilite.* (+1 Karma)

HQuest 33: Mall Opportunities

-   Head to the mall and meet the girl at the very top.

-   Donate $30000 to her… Then talk to her in the shop to get *Occa
    Berry.*

-   Give her 5 Occa Berries after either farming them or using the stash
    we bought earlier. You'll get a *Passho Berry.* Either farm four
    more or put off this quest until we get our next department store
    stamp, when we'll be able to buy more.

-   Talk to ICSW again, then head to the berry store downstairs.

-   Re-enter the ice cream shop. Then, enter the restaurant next door.
    After exiting, head to Terajuma Shore.

-   On the west end by the lighthouse, talk to the grunt. After getting
    paid off, return to the restaurant.

-   Then, talk to the officer downstairs.

-   Talk to ICSW again, then talk to Aya in the lab center.

-   Return to the help center to get $25840 and MegaStone
    *Altarianite.* (+1 Karma).

After doing all three quests, head over to Venam's gym to fight Aya.

Wasteland Punk Aya (Corrosive Field)

-   Lycanroc, Level 82. @ Telluric Seed.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Accelerock

    -   Crunch

    -   Drill Run

-   Nidoqueen, Level 80. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Sludge Wave

    -   Earth Power

    -   Blizzard

    -   Thunderbolt

-   Venusaur, Level 81. @ Coba Berry.

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Venoshock

    -   Sleep Powder

    -   Hidden Power Fire

-   Drapion, Level 82. @ Scope Lens.

    -   Night Slash

    -   Cross Poison

-   Tentacruel, Level 80. @ Shuca Berry.

    -   Scald

    -   Blizzard

    -   Sludge Wave

    -   Muddy Water

-   Dragalge, Level 83. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Sludge Wave

    -   Venoshock

    -   Hydro Pump

    -   Dragon Pulse

This can be a scary battle: Lycanroc is guaranteed one turn of safety
plus an attack boost. If you can knock that out, the defensive core of
Mega Venusaur, Tentacruel, and Dragalge are all intense! The good news
is there isn't really anything preventing you from decimating her team
with Earthquake, so if you can knock out Lycanroc and slow down
Tentacruel somehow you might be able to sweep from there.

Fly over to Sashila Village. Now there is a new move tutor!

Sashila Move Tutor

Heat Wave 6 Red Shards

Pain Split 4 Yellow Shards

Zen Headbutt 4 Green Shards

One more quest we can do. Head to Oblitus Town. If you've done the Yui's
ranch quest, enter Kelvin's house on the right side of town and get the
*PokeFlute* for $45000. Then, go to Honec Woods where **Snorlax** is
to get it.

## Route 4 Thirteen Badge Update

Next is a quick detour to Route 4 to get some new Den Pokemon - feel
free to skip this one as well.

Essentially, now that we've beaten Souta, all four of the dens have been
updated with new Pokemon! So, I will list the Pokemon in each here.

RIFT DEN 1 (12 - 16 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
**Rockruff**, Shiftry, **Reuniclus**, Solosis, Tropius, Sigilyph,
Dhelmise. The rare ones are Relicanth**,** Persian, Lumineon, Sudowoodo,
Lanturn.

RIFT DEN 2 (12 - 16 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
Unfezant, **Wailord**, Dunsparce, Mandibuzz, Masquerain, Quagsire,
Togedemaru. The rare ones are Chatot, Snorunt, Glalie, Cacnea, Cacturne,
Claydol, **Klefki**.

RIFT DEN 3 (12 - 16 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
Stoutland, Crabrawler, Pachirisu, Chimecho, Stunfisk, **Kadabra,**
Mankey. The rare ones are Rhydon, Vanilluxe, Vanillish, Purugly, Ditto,
Ursaring.

RIFT DEN 4 (12 - 16 Badges): The common encounters in this den are
Lombre, Gastrodon, **Seismitoad,** Swanna. The rare ones are Mantine,
**Jellicent**, **Timburr.**

Entering Cairo's shop, he has even more available crests now!

Cairo's Shop New Items (13 Badges)

*Boltund Crest* 9000 Red Essences

*Probopass Crest* 9000 Red Essences

*Swalot Crest* 9000 Red Essences

*Cinccino Crest* 9000 Red Essences

Head up towards Den 4. You'll spot **Sobble** hiding in the water. Chase
it a few times for a battle!

Make sure you have 15000 Red Essence, then fly to Secret Shore, and head
to the left. You'll notice a strength boulder across the water - push it
out of the way, and you'll find a special den. Put in 15000 Red Essence
and a Rift Matter, and you'll be able to battle **Beldum!** It has two
shields. Just make sure you don't kill it or let it Take Down itself to
death. When you catch it, your reward will be *Xen Waste.* Note that
this is a special shadow Pokemon and needs to enter the Purify Chamber
in the PC such that all 9 of the slots have perfect “flow” in order to
be purified. Easiest way to do this is to stick 36 normal types in.

## Route 10 First Visit

Real quick, fly over to Route 9. Head to where we fought Souta earlier,
and you'll find the MegaStone *Pidgeotite* Head south from the Rose
Theater, and you'll notice that Route 10 to the right is now open. We
can't do anything there yet except catch some Pokemon.

Route 10

|              |          |                 |          |                |          |

| Lycanroc     | 10       | Quagsire        | 20       | **Wingull**    | 1        |
| Talonflame   | 2        | **Shellder**    | 20       |                |          |

You can also catch the overhead **Wingull** and **Pelipper!**

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image99.PNG"
style="width:4.875in;height:3.42538in"
alt="A picture containing text, person, orange Description automatically generated" />

That's all we can do right now, so head back to the GDC Tournament
Stadium and board the ship.

## Nastasia's Ship

Talk to the group in the meeting room of Nastasia's ship.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Fine... (Ren +1, Aelita +1)  
- There's no way. (Ren -1)      

Head to the right.

Relationship Point Choices:
- We're a team! (Aelita +1)  
- You have to do it alone. (Aelita -1)

After another conversation, you can talk to Sharon for a battle against
the duo. It's optional, but winning will get you relationship points
(Ren +2, Aelita +2).

Head up the ladder and talk to Nastasia and Ren. Follow her into the
room on the right, then go back downstairs.

Beat the Xen grunts for relationship points (+1 Aelita) , then on the
couch, accept Aelita's request for story time. We're now playing as her
with her team for a little bit!

As soon as you get control, head over to the spot on the left side of
the arena for a battle with the best character in the game.

    -   U-Turn

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Flare Blitz

    -   Gale Strike

-   Infernape, Level 73. @ Life Orb.

    -   Flare Blitz

    -   Slash and Burn

    -   Thunderpunch

    -   Close Combat

You'll be using Aelita's team, so this one can be tough. I recommend
starting with Cherrim and Starmie - these two are fast and strong and
clean up most of his team easily. You can do it!

Afterwards, you'll get the *Cherrim Crest.* Tell Aelita you want to rest
for a while once you're ready. Head outside the airship when you wake
up!

## Zone Zero Pt. 1

Zone Zero

|              |          |
|--------------|----------|
| Grass | % |
| Helioptile   | 30       |
| Maractus     | 30       |
| Vullaby      | 14       |
| Tauros       | 10       |

| Skorupi      | 5        |
| Drapion      | 1        |
| Mandibuzz    | 1        |

First, head down and to the left.

ZCell 096: Zone Zero Outskirts

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image100.png"
style="width:6.625in;height:4.97917in" />

Enter the zone to the north. There are some Xen Grunts selling stuff
here.

Zone Zero Left Grunt

*Blast Powder* $2500

Zone Zero Right Grunt

*Poke Ball* $200

*Great Ball* $600

*Ultra Ball* $1200

*Super Repel* $500

*Max Repel* $700

*Escape Rope* $550

We'll need a few Blast Powders to progress, so buy them now. Use the PC
star above to add an Electric type to your party. You'll need one, so
catch a Helioptile out here if you don't have one yet. Audino will heal
your team if you talk to it.

Enter the building and go down to the basement. You can hop across any
single-spaced gaps, so do so to get to the right side of the map. Talk
to the panel with your electric type to light it up.

ZCell 097: Abandoned Apartments

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image101.png"
style="width:6.64583in;height:4.98958in" />

After the short dialogue scene, enter the second door upstairs. Smash
the rock and use the blast powder to talk to Aelita. As her, jump the
two gaps and talk to the glowing spot to get a key. As the player again,
head right and up to enter the door furthest right. Beat the goons and
enter the first door upstairs.

Beat the grunt then go up the ladder to talk to Aelita. As her again,
parkour to the right and jump down the hole. Attempt to jump across, but
when you can't, take your character to the second door to smash the
rock. As Aelita, parkour down and to the right, then up. Interact with
the bookshelf here, then as your character battle the grunt and enter
door \#3. Use blast powder, then parkour to the right twice and use the
panel.

Upstairs, enter the open door and beat the grunt. You'll then regain
control of Aelita, so head back to the power room at the bottom.

Popstar Risa Raider (No Field)

-   Tuff Puff, Level 90. @Air Balloon.

    -   Poison Jab

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Draco Meteor

    -   Flamethrower

You'll win if you just use Giga Drain with Cherrim, Return with Golem!
If not, surely the other Pokemon can do it. Winning grants Relationship
Points (Ren +1, Aelita +1).

Back as your character, head to the right and exit this building. Pick
up a hidden *Yellow Shard,* and enter the next building to the right.
Once you enter, you'll fall to the abandoned depths!

Once you're in the depths, heal with Audino, then talk to the crew and
learn you can switch characters by pressing the A key. To progress in
this area, I recommend this order:

-   As MC, go up and battle the grunt. Follow the path forward to the
    hole.

-   As Ren, head right, then fly up and over the gap. Each gap is
    distinguished by an obvious indent in the floor. Follow this path to
    the second gap, then to the third. Head over to the left to the gap
    you can't cross.

-   As Aelita, push the boulder into the hole, then cross the gap to the
    right. Follow the path to the next gap and attempt to cross.

-   As Ren, approach the gap and boost Aelita across. Then, navigate him
    all the way right to the stairs.

-   As Aelita, head to the right, dropping the second boulder. Navigate
    her to the stairs to the right.

-   AS MC, follow the path right, beating the grunts. Rendezvous with
    the crew!

Once you've cleared the puzzle, heal with Audino and head to the right.
After a cutscene, follow the stairs up and exit the building.

In this area, smash the two rocks to the left for easier backtracking
and navigation.

Head down to the bottom to find:

ZCell 098: Zone Zero

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image102.png"
style="width:6.6875in;height:5.02083in" />

Head up and to the right. In the bottom corner of this area, grab *TM93
Wild Charge.* At the Lux Apartments, head up and right to grab a *Rare
Candy* and hidden *Revive.* Then, head straight down past a line of
grass to grab the *Zone Zero Key*. This lets us get to Alamissa from
here, and vice versa.

Head up, battling the grunt along the way. Loop around to the left for
an *Ultra Potion,* then go up along the upper path to get a *Razor
Claw.* To the left is a hidden *Red Shard.* Once you've grabbed these
items go all the way to the left and into the building on the top left
of the area.

If you removed your electric type, readd it to your team, pick up a
hidden *Yellow Shard* in a bookshelf, and enter the backroom. Go
downstairs and power on the generator. (This is the last time we will
need the electric type in V12). Enter the newly opened room and read the
book with Ren, then exit this building and enter the one below it.

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and enter Nymiera's old house. Go to the
basement to click the lever. Save/heal and approach the top of the Zone
Zero area.

Rogue Psychic Lorna (Psychic Terrain)

-   Vivillon, Level 82. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Rage Powder

    -   Psychic

    -   Sleep Powder

    -   Bug Buzz

-   Aromatisse, Level 82. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Trick Room

    -   Reflect

    -   Moonblast

    -   Light Screen

-   Darmanitan, Level 83. @ Darmanitan Crest.

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Psychic

    -   Will-O-Wisp

    -   Focus Blast

-   Fused Solrock, Level 84. @ Life Orb.

    -   Zen Headbutt

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Solar Flare

    -   Will-O-Wisp

-   Stonjourner, Level 83. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Heat Crash

    -   Heavy Slam

    -   Body Press

-   Aevian Lapras, Level 83. @ Weakness Policy.

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Earth Power

    -   Psychic

    -   Power Gem

This battle is a total bruh moment the first time you play it. Unless
you have spread moves that are gonna be able to knock out the
bulky-as-hell Aromatisse turn one or use your own Trick Room, most
likely, you get eight turns of having to deal with her slow team going
first and causing massive damage. Aromatisse will set up screens as
well, meaning after Stonjourner and Darmanitan wear you down, you'll be
easy picking for Lapras and Solrock. I recommend knocking out Aromatisse
at all costs then stalling -- once the screens and the trick room go
away, you'll have a much easier time taking out the rest of her team.
Alternatively, starting with two or three leads who are slow will
encourage her not to use Trick Room right away, then after you take out
Aromatisse you can switch to your faster sweepers.

## Zone Zero Pt. 2

After an… unfortunate scene, head up and to the right down a little
path. Catch/fight/run from Mandibuzz, and pick up a hidden *Yellow
Shard* if you'd like. Then follow the path around to the top left of the
area, pick up a hidden *Red Shard,* then talk to Ren then the cracked
rock.

Head up and to the left for a battle with **Skarmory,** if you'd like.
Follow the path instead to the right and enter the building here. Go
downstairs and read the journal, then head upstairs and exit.

Once in this area, go left for a hidden *Red Shard,* then go right to
the Pokemon Center area. After the scene, grab the *Full Restore* below.
Then head into the Center and talk to the crew.

After a few cutscenes, you'll get to play as Melia. All you must do is
follow the path through this area but be prepared for a battle!

League Scout Amanda (Factory Field)

-   Incineroar, Level 83. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Flare Blitz

    -   Fake Out

    -   Darkest Lariat

    -   Thunderpunch

-   Bronzong, Level 83. @ Amplified Rock.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Gyro Ball

    -   Psywave

    -   Trick Room

-   Torkoal, Level 82. @ Heat Rock.

    -   Eruption

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Earth Power

    -   Solarbeam

-   Rhyperior, Level 81. @ Rindo Berry.

    -   Megahorn

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Drill Run

    -   Thunderpunch

-   Hatterene, Level 85. @ Life Orb.

    -   Psychic

    -   Mystical Fire

    -   Moonblast

    -   Trick Room

-   Druddigon, Level 84. @ Druddigon Crest.

    -   Dragon Claw

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Thunderpunch

    -   Sucker Punch

This is a 12v6 double battle with Madelis on your side, so luckily, it's
not too bad at all. Madelis' Houndoom can nearly one shot all the
Pokemon that resist its Heat Wave under Torkoal's sun, so just let that
happen and use logical moves with Melia's Pokemon and you'll be just
fine.

At this point, if we did the West Gearen Help Quest involving Sakitron,
we will get Relationship Points (Melia +2, Erick +2). What follows is a
mech-battle sequence. The mechanics are complicated, but you don't have
to necessarily win this one. If you do want to win, I recommend just
using the attack she references in the text right before you attack - if
she uses “hammer”, “bash”, or “top” in her text you'll be able to know
which to use. If she says the other thing, I recommend “tank engine”. I
don't know all the mechanics of this fight yet, but this strategy worked
for me the two times I played it.

Once you regain control, head left and up out of the center, then enter
the now-opened gate area.

After a scene, go left:

ZCell 099: Zone Zero

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image103.png"
style="width:6.70833in;height:5.05208in" />

Also grab the *Fire Stone* above. When you're ready, enter the stairs to
the right. Grab the info on *Pulse: Garna…* heal and get ready for
action.

If you grabbed the Weird Diary in the past, now is another chance to use
it!

Dimensional Rift Hippowdon (Desert Field)

-   Hippowdon, Level 85. @ Black Sludge. Type: Ground / Poison. Ability:
    Accumulate. Stats: 254/168/180/182/142/47. 4 Shields.

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Rock Tomb

    -   Spit Up

    -   Earth Power

This one isn't too bad… Ren's team puts in work by supplying Arenite
Wall and he also tends to burn it. Dropping its attack stats super low
is a good move - it's so slow you should be able to get off at least a
Memento or something if you so choose. It holds Black Sludge which you
can knock off. Using super effective moves to slowly chip away at each
of its four shields afterwards will do the trick.

You can literally loot a knocked out Bladestar grunt for an *Ability
Capsule!* Afterwards, head up and out! Nothing can be done to the left
now, so head up to the next map. On the right by a gravestone, you'll
find:

ZCell 100: Zone Zero

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image104.png"
style="width:6.71875in;height:4.96875in" />

Head up and to the left for one more cutscene.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Sure! (Ren +1, Aelita +1)  
- Define "okay". (Ren +2, Aelita +2)

Head up.

## Eclysia Pyramid

After the scene, enter the pyramid above. You'll watch another, then on
the left you'll find:

ZCell 101: Eclysia Pyramid

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image105.png"
style="width:6.64583in;height:4.98958in" />

Enter the spring at the top and watch the scenes play out. Next, we're
going to begin the crawl to the top, so enter the room at the right side
of the lobby and head up.

We get control of Aelita and Ren again. The following is the sequence
that will get us through the first section:

-   As Aelita, battle the goon and click the blue switch.

-   As Ren, head down, then click the green switch.

-   As Aelita, position yourself above the green bridge in the middle.

-   As MC, head up and battle the grunt, then click the blue switch.

-   As Ren, head back up and go all the way up and right.

-   As Aelita, head up and stand on the red switch here.

-   As Ren, pass the red bridge and beat the grunt. Wait in this area.

-   As Aelita, step off the switch and position yourself down below the
    blue bridge.

-   As Ren, step on the green switch.

-   As MC, walk up past the green bridge as far as it will let you go.

-   As Aelita, walk past the green switch and press the blue switch.

-   As Ren, walk up and stand on the red switch.

-   As Aelita, walk as far up as it will let you go.

-   As Ren, head up as far as you can

-   Return to control of the MC and head up for a battle!

While the battle may seem tough, they're just slightly beefed-up
Magneton and Claydol. We'll be fighting more of these throughout the
tower, but they aren't too tough. Every mech we will face has Steel as
their primary type.

Now, onto the second part of the puzzle:

-   As MC, walk up and stand on the red switch.

-   As Ren, head right and fight the defense mechanism. The outcome
    affects relationship points: Winning grants (+1 Allen), losing
    grants (-1 Allen).

-   As Aelita, head up and fight the defense mechanism. The outcome
    affects relationship points: Winning grants (+1 Allen), losing
    grants (-1 Allen). Then, head all the way up to click the blue
    switch.

-   As Ren, cross the first blue bridge and head all the way up to stand
    next to the blue switch in the upper right area. Make sure you're on
    the left side of the bridge that leads to the red switch.

-   As Aelita, cross the blue bridge at the left, go left, down, left,
    and click the green switch.

-   As MC, cross the green bridge and wait in this area.

-   As Ren, click the blue switch, then cross to the right and stand on
    the red switch.

-   As Aelita, go all the way to the right, across the red and purple
    bridges until you can't go further.

-   As MC, head up past the red bridge and wait there.

-   As Ren, head all the way to the left until you can't go further.

-   Finally, as MC go up and rendezvous!

Head up and follow the path… after another scene, it's time for another
mech battle!!!!!

Luckily this is the same deal as before, I guided Allen to victory by
doing the attack the grunt mentioned in their dialogue before our turn.
It is optional, but the outcome affects relationship points: winning
grants (+5 Allen, +5 Alice), losing grants (-3 Allen, -3 Alice).

After some interesting scenes, head up to battle some goons. You'll be
tag-teamed with the other characters here -- these fights aren't too
tough.

After… that, head up and follow the path. In general, the next few rooms
are straightforward progression, talking to characters as necessary.
You'll also find this, in the room with hoverboard dude:

ZCell 102: Eclysia Pyramid

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image106.png"
style="width:6.64583in;height:4.96875in" />

Emerge at the Eclysia Skyview!

## Pyramid Point Badge

Desert's Mark: Changes the target into a Ground-type and inflicts them
with Sand Tomb \| On Desert Field, Sand Tomb deals 1/6 max HP per turn
(up from 1/8).

Most of Rejuvenation's fields have something you can exploit, something
that you can do to either change the field or effectively steal its
benefits for your own use. Unfortunately, Desert Field is not really one
of these, as you cannot change it to any other field directly by moves,
and there is no type whose attacks are boosted directly. On top of
default Sandstorm (not as bad as Strong Wind, thankfully) you're gonna
really need to think outside the box to defeat our buddy Ryland. Or is
it Flora?

Anyways, one of the biggest pitfalls this field throws at you is that it
gives all Ground types a free 1.5x in Special Defense. Pretty annoying
because it means that you're gonna need to more heavily rely on physical
attacks even though many of his team members are very defensive.
Additionally, Dig comes out in just one turn and is boosted to 120 base
power, so it's an even stronger STAB Earthquake.

Nidoqueen is the only Pokemon here that doesn't really have insane
synergy with the field and weather other than this boost - even then it
melts your tanky dreams by laying Toxic Spikes or piercing you with
mixed Sheer Force offense. His Claydol has a crest which notably makes
its special attack stronger and makes Hyper Beam not need a recharge
turn, which means it hits hard. Arenite Wall on this, Torterra, and
Gliscor can always come out, even if you change the weather on them,
which makes his team even more hard to kill. Gliscor, particularly with
its seed, is super annoying, because not only can it tank your attacks
and heal, but also hit hard with Dig and 110 base Acrobatics. Torterra
on the other hand is annoying for a different reason: its crest swaps
its resistances and weaknesses: say goodbye to 4x Ice, Fire, Bug, Flying
and say hello to… just Rock and Ground, which it hits super effectively
anyways. It and Torterra's Desert Mark attack turns your typing to
Ground and fixes Sand Tomb on you as well, particularly useful for
Torterra as the next turn it can use super effective Wood Hammer. Mega
Camerupt also hits like a truck, especially if you take advantage of
free 8 turn Sun on the field and will almost certainly one-shot most
things with boosted Heat Wave. And finally, there is Sand Rush
Excadrill, once deemed so good it had to be banned from competitive
play. Since then, sand has gotten nerfs here and there and it's not too
bad - after all, if you can switch weather, it's back to normal base 88
speed… right? On this field Sand Rush is always on so it will almost
always outspeed you and will murder with Dig or Rock Slide.

So, as I hinted at earlier, Sun can be viable here, since Heat Wave and
Burn Up are boosted on the field, and it lasts for 8 turns no matter
what. This means you can slap a Telluric Seed, Air Balloon or something
else on your sun setter and still get the full benefits. Alternatively,
the move Scald gets a 1.5x boost, so you could switch the weather to
rain and go to town with a Swift Swim user to at least rival the
speediness of Excadrill and threaten Claydol, Nidoqueen, Camerupt, and
Gliscor, though it does get cancelled somewhat by the 1.5x special
defense boost for ground types. Like with Souta's field, you also may
get some success by simply copying what Ryland is doing: send in your
own tanky Ground types with Telluric Seeds and see what havoc they can
wreak. One way or another you can overcome Flora once and for all!

After the battle, heal up, because there's more…

Head back to the top, then go up when you hear a sound at the skyview.
After a few cutscenes, you'll enter a battle! There is a catch with this
one, see if you can spot it.

After a few more cutscenes, you'll be in control of Adam and Delpha for
another battle!

    -   Reflect

    -   Psychic

This one can be tough, luckily nothing as bad as the previous fight with
Ryland though. I recommend using Thunder Wave on Mismagius and then
focusing on defeating the other side. Mega Aerodactyl and Gigalith are
great clean up. Arenite Wall can be activated anytime if you need it. Be
careful of Stantler's Crest which allows it to hit Hypnosis much more
frequently and boosts its attack.

That's it for this bit, the spring will turn lush and green! If only
this could've happened earlier to nullify desert field. Anyways, go
ahead and approach the spring when you can. You'll get the Pyramid Point
Badge and *TM105 Arenite Wall!* After a few more scenes, you'll be given
a choice to teleport. Say yes if you want to continue the story, but
otherwise we can fit in a few quests while we're on this island.

## Zone Zero Quests

There are a couple side quests that are now open in Zone Zero and
elsewhere. Skip ahead to the hospital raid section if you want to finish
the story.

Surf to the left side and the right side of the pyramid to get *Ground
Memory* and *TM28 Dig.* Could've been useful 15 minutes ago!

Next, enter the Eclysia Skyview, then make your way down the lift. Once
you use a teleporter, head left and surf up and across. Pick up the
*Magic Wand* here! Exit the pyramid.

Head into the Apartment Depths where we were ambushed by Bladestar. Down
here, you can grab:

ZCell 103: Apartment Depths

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image107.png"
style="width:6.64583in;height:5.02083in" />

Head up after grabbing this cell to get an *Ability Capsule!* Then, head
left and follow the path all the way to the left to grab the shiny Lux
Apartment keys.

Exit this building, get the right team ready and enter the one
immediately to the right.

Challenger Venus (Big Top Arena)

-   Luxray, Level 83. @ Luxray Crest.

    -   Wild Charge

    -   Strength

    -   Superpower

    -   Iron Tail

-   Centiskorch, Level 85. @ Life Orb.

    -   Fire Lash

    -   Power Whip

    -   Leech Life

    -   Will-o-Wisp

-   Azumarill, Level 84. @ Iapapa Berry.

    -   Aqua Jet

    -   Waterfall

    -   Sing

    -   Play Rough

-   Rillaboom, level 84. @ Synthetic Seed.

    -   Swords Dance

    -   Acrobatics

    -   High Horsepower

    -   Drum Beating

-   Steelix, Level 85. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Iron Tail

    -   Earthquake

    -   Strength

    -   Smack Down

-   Ledian, Level 87. @ Ledian Crest.

    -   Mach Punch

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Thunderpunch

    -   Power-Up-Punch

These mad lads did it - made Ledian half decent! It's punching moves hit
4 times, so… it's gonna get up to max attack quick or perhaps wear you
down with priority Mach Punch! Venus has a tough team, though almost
entirely because of the team's synergy with the field. Many of Ledian,
Luxray, and Steelix's moves can be boosted by the field, and since most
of them have the affected abilities, which means they're going to hit
real hard basically every time. Plus Azumarill's 100% accurate Sing, and
you're in for a tricky fight.

Revelation/Petal/Fiery Dance are all boosted under this field, so a team
using these that targets their low special defense might succeed.
Dragon/Swords/Quiver Dance also boost stats even more, so a sweeper
might see success here if they can get the opportunity to set up.
Acrobatics also is boosted here and can help you get rid of Ledian,
Rillaboom, and Centiskorch.

Succeed to nab the third *Star Shard*, as well as the *Ledian Crest*,
and the fifth *Department Store Stamp!*

Exit the building and go straight to the right. Enter the tall apartment
building with the key.

Once you enter, we're going to be doing a puzzle like RSE's Abandoned
Ship backrooms. Feel free to solve this yourself, but the route is as
follows:

-   Enter the bottom left room, 1A. Interact with the upper right
    sparkle in this room, the one that is in the second tile from the
    right in the upper right corner, to grab a key.

-   Exit, and enter the top right room, 1F. Interact with the upper left
    tile of the table to grab the next key.

-   Exit and enter the top middle room, 1E. Study these sparkles, then
    head left and enter 1D. In the rightmost tile of the bed in this
    room you'll find another key!

-   Exit, and go upstairs and enter the top right room, 2F. Study the
    sparkles, then go into 2E. In the bottom tile of the bed in the 2F
    side you'll find the next key.

-   Exit and loop around to the bottom right door, 2C. Go around and
    exit through the 2B door.

-   After falling, enter the bottom middle door, 1B. Grab the key two
    tiles above the rightmost rock.

-   Using the door to the left to get back to the main area, head out of
    1A and go upstairs to the upper left room, 2D. Grab the key in the
    single sparkle, as well as:

ZCell 104: Lux Apartments

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image108.png"
style="width:6.66667in;height:4.96875in" />

-   Reenter 2C, then go out the 2B door. Use the key on 1C in the bottom
    right door, then enter the ladder. Click the lever in this area and
    pick up *Rocky Helmet.*

Now if you head up in Zone Zero to the next map, you'll find that a gate
has opened, leading you to be able to catch **Gible!** Keep it unevolved
for now or catch two, there is a small quest we can do in a bit with it.
Also:

## Do the Dive (Floria)

Now that we have the Enigmatic Key, we can do some underwater exploring.
All three of the next sections are optional content, but I recommend all
of it!

Evergreen Trench

|                   |          |                   |          |

| Clawitzer         | 5        |                   |          |
| Alomomola         | 4        |                   |          |
| **Walrein**       | 1        |                   |          |

Fly to the Evergreen Island first, and surf down onto Route 11. First
thing we are going to do is go all the way up and right in the route, to
the large mostly circular dive spot. Dive down in this area and interact
with the submarine here. Hidden here is a *Blue Shard* and *Damp Rock.*
Anyways, we're activating the underwater pillars on this route, tallest
to shortest.

Surface, then go straight down and dive in the blob-shaped dive spot.
Down here is a hidden *Dive Ball.* Resurface.

Fly back to Evergreen Island (to save a few seconds of surfing) and surf
right, then down. You'll find a 2x2 square to go down, where you'll find
the tallest pillar. Interact with it to activate it.

Surface, and dive down in the main area of Route 11. This gargantuan
area has lots of hidden items, including 4 *Blue Shards, Revive,
GourmetTreat, 3 Heart Scales, Pearl, Sea Incense, Ultra Potion, Water
Stone, Max Repel, Nugget, Dive Ball,* and *Green Shard.* Anyways, in the
southwest area of the map, you'll find a small 2x2 square to surface. Do
so to grab *TM33 Reflect!* Dive back down, and at the bottom of this
area you'll see a little tunnel you can go through. Do so and surface to
nab *TM16 Light Screen.* Dive again and go left after exiting the tunnel
to the north. Activate the taller pillar here.

Head straight to the right until you find another pillar. Activate it,
then surface in the 2x2 square immediately to the right to get *Icicle
Plate.* Go back down and go up above the third pillar. Surface at this
2x2 square to grab ZCrystal *Primarium-Z.*

Head back down, then approach the tunnel / 2nd pillar area. At the
bottom left, sort of hard to spot, is the fourth pillar. Activate it,
then return to the submarine. After a conversation, surface, fly back to
Evergreen, then dive right here and enter the door.

Head up, beating 3 sets of defense mechanisms along the way. Once you
reach the top, you'll be gifted the *Empoleon Crest.* Nice.

Next up, we're gonna fly to the Secret Shore. Make your way to the
Wetlands Laboratory and use the teleporter to get to the backroom. Use
the downward pads to go down, then dive in the water. Follow the path
and surface.

Grab *TM112 Smart Strike* as well as Shadow Amaura! Use the teleporter
to get out.

## Do the Dive (Terajuma)

Next, we're gonna explore some of Terajuma Island. First, fly to Teila
Resort, and enter Aquamarine Cave. Make your way to the Aquamarine
Chamber. Dive down in this area. We're going to need to activate a few
panels in this area by floating over them, so follow this sequence:

-   Step on the 1st panel immediately above the dive spot.

-   Go straight down, then straight right. Activate the 2nd panel in
    this new area.

-   Go up as much as possible, then left. In this area, go left from the
    up-most position such that you go up to the northmost area. Activate
    the 3rd panel.

-   Go left, then down on the right tile of the two. In this small gap,
    head down and activate the fourth panel.

That's all we can do in this main area for the time being, so dive back
out at the light spot where we activated the first panel.

Next, make your way to the floor which Amber once fell through. Surf
down and to the left, then dive down on any of the tiles in the lowest
row. Once back in the current maze, go directly to the right, then go
left once you stop before the green rock. Go left then down, then head
to the right. Make sure you use the bottom of the two current tiles to
go to the right here. Follow this path to the left and out.

In this area, grab the *Water Memory,* then activate the pillar in this
area. Head up and swim off the side once you've done this.

Terajuma Coral Reef

| Clawitzer         | 5        |
| **Dragalge**      | 5        |

There is also various wild dive Pokemon swimming about you can interact
with for a battle.

If you head up, you can talk to Challenger Neptune for a tough battle!

Challenger Neptune (Underwater Field)

-   Raichu, Level 85. @ Life Orb.

    -   Psychic

    -   Focus Blast

    -   Surf

    -   Discharge

-   Samurott, Level 84. @ Elemental Seed.

    -   Dive

    -   Megahorn

    -   Sacred Sword

    -   Swords Dance

-   Whiscash, Level 84. @ Whiscash Crest.

    -   Dive

    -   Dragon Dance

    -   Stone Edge

    -   Earthquake

-   Blastoise, Level 87. @ Blastoisinite.

    -   Water Pulse

    -   Whirlpool

    -   Ice Beam

    -   Aura Sphere

-   Dhelmise, Level 85. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Anchor Shot

    -   Power Whip

    -   Whirlpool

    -   Earthquake

-   Cradily, Level 85. @ Leftovers.

    -   Curse

    -   Earthquake

    -   Toxic

    -   Recover

This one is tough at first as she uses the Underwater Field well. In
general, your non-water types not named Armaldo, Beartic, or Dhelmise
will all have their speed quartered on this field, which is obviously
not good since so many of their Pokemon can hit hard with field boosted
water moves. Whiscash is dangerous here, as it has no weaknesses (except
Water itself, on the Underwater Field) and surely can set up on you if
you can't take it out in time. Luckily, if either Samurott or Whiscash
uses Dive, the field will be returned to water surface, at least
allowing you to not suffer so much speed loss. Her Raichu is
devastating, as Surf and Discharge are both boosted by the field here,
and it's given double speed by Surge Surfer. Dhelmise is good on this
field as well.

One idea is to use your own water types as soon as Raichu and Dhelmise
go down, as they suffer no speed loss and can take advantage of the
field to hit Whiscash super-effectively and fight back against Samurott
and Blastoise. The water surface field also was a bit easier to deal
with in my experience - if you use Dive/Fly/Bounce/Shore Up or can bait
Whiscash/Samurott to use it, it can make the fight easier. Plus, you can
use Blizzard to turn the surface into Icy or Sludge Wave to turn it into
Murkwater as usual. A tough fight but lots of ways to turn the odds in
your favor.

Win against Neptune to get the fourth *Star Shard*, **Popplio,** and the
sixth Department Store Stamp!

Make your way to the right. Surface at the spot just before the dark
zone. Once on Route 6, head to the right, and dive down in the dive spot
here. Follow this path around and enter the now-opened tower.

Read the lore on the green-tinted bookshelves if you want, then grab the
*Zangoose Crest* and the *Ariados Crest.* Exit and resurface.

Next, fly to Kakori Village and enter Valor Mountain. Use the blue
crystal and make your way to the Valor Chamber at the bottom. Dive down
when you can here, then follow the path to the left and grab ZCrystal
*Waterium-Z.* Take JUST ONE set of currents to the left, then go up and
to the right. Activate this fifth panel (along with the four we found
earlier), prepare for battle, and head up through the now-opened door.

Temple Kingdra (Underwater Field)

-   Seaking, Level 84. @ Elemental Seed.

    -   Waterfall

    -   Megahorn

    -   Whirlpool

    -   Soak

-   Dragalge, Level 85. @ White Herb.

    -   Thunderbolt

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Draco Meteor

    -   Scald

-   Clawitzer, Level 85. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Water Pulse

    -   Aura Sphere

    -   Ice Beam

    -   Dark Pulse

-   Poliwrath, Level 85. @ Waterium-Z.

    -   Earthquake

    -   Dive

    -   Submission

    -   Whirlpool

-   Corsola, Level 84. @ Choice Band.

    -   Head Smash

    -   Waterfall

    -   Earthquake

    -   Icicle Spear

-   Kingdra, Level 86. @ Scope Lens.

    -   Dive

    -   Iron Head

    -   Focus Energy

    -   Outrage

Another tough underwater field battle, but like the Neptune battle,
utilizing field-change moves like Dive -\> Blizzard may be the key to
victory here! Alternatively, again your own water type can be quite
effective in this field. Just be careful of Kingdra's consistent
critical hits!

Once you've won, head up to catch a Horsea**!** A weird prize since we
got Horsea a few badges ago, but ok…

Exit in the same spot of the maze as we entered the first time.

Last place to dive on this island is at the first place we entered - so
fly to the shore. Surf to the northeast corner and dive. It's time to
explore the S.S. Oceania once again…

There is some *Luminous Moss* at the top of the entry room, as well as
Corsola. Heading to the right you'll be attacked by **Sharpedo**. There
is a hidden *Rare Candy* to the right. In this first room, pick up 5
*Dive Balls* then follow the path. Pick up a *Water Stone* in the room
next to you, then beat the next Sharpedo. More *Luminous Moss* is hidden
here.

A room to the left will have MegaStone *Sharpedonite.* To the right,
beat another shark then follow the path to pick up 5 more *Dive Balls.*
Exit to the right for 5 *Luxury Balls.* A door at the top to the left
leads you to a *Dawn Stone* and 3 hidden *Pearls.* Finally, head up the
stairs here and you'll have a chance to battle and catch **Mareanie!**
Exit the ship the same way we came in.

## Kingdom of Goomidra

There's another major side quest we can do! One more new dive spot to
explore, and it's quite the big one! Enter Honec Woods and make your way
to the upper right-hand corner. Dive down here.

Swamp Pit

|                   |          |
|-------------------|----------|
| Underwater | % |
| Stunfisk          | 30       |
| Gastrodon         | 30       |
| Clamperl          | 20       |
| Octillery         | 10       |
| Dragalge          | 5        |
| Clawitzer         | 5        |

Emerge at the top into the Kingdom of Goomidra. Hidden around town is 2
*Red Shards,* and a *Tiny Mushroom.* Speaking of mushrooms: there are
tutor Goomy that accept them in various houses:

Left-Middle Move Tutor

Seed Bomb 1 Tiny Mushroom

Dragon Pulse 1 Big Mushroom

Pain Split 1 Big Mushroom

Rightmost-Middle Move Tutor

Liquidation 2 Big Mushrooms

Drill Run 3 Big Mushrooms

Stomping Tantrum 3 Big Mushrooms

Zen Headbutt 3 Big Mushrooms

Gastro Acid 1 Tiny Mushroom

In the top right area of the town, grab 3 *Pecha Berries*, 2 *Lum
Berries*, 3 *Starf Berries*, 2 *Enigma Berries*, and 2 *Aspear Berries*.

Enter the castle at the top, then talk to Goomelda in her room. Exit the
castle afterwards, then talk to Goomink in the upper left house of the
village. At the top of the village, fight and beat Goomink, then fly
over to East Gearen after he leaves.

Enter Venam's gym, and head to the back. Fight Aya with Goomink. Shock
Wave tends to work.

After winning, head outside the gym, then fly to Kakori Village. Head
down to Crawli's arena and talk to Goomink here. Beat Crawli here.
Counter tends to work.

Fight Goomy once you're outside the gym again. Fly to Sashila, then the
Zorrialyn Coast to the south. Heal Goomy, then after the conversation
head to the water in the village. Talk to the guy to add a yacht stop to
the village, then talk to Goomink to embark.

Kawopundunga (Underwater Field)

-   Kawopundunga Wailord, Level 90. @ Leftovers. Stats:
    800/100/80/90/100/80. Ability: Water Veil. 3 Shields.

    -   Frustration

    -   Dive

    -   Rest

    -   Darkest Lariat

This is also a very tough battle at first look. With 800 HP, as well as
the ability Water Veil which will always be activated on this field,
you're in for a hard time taking it out. As a boss battle, there is no
way to change its ability, and it has infinite PP. And, it has field
boosted Dives.

One strategy is of course to change up the field on it. Two uses of
Sludge Wave will bring it to Murkwater Surface permanently, which
prevents Water Veil from activating, and actively hurts Wailord each
turn… so literally you can just wait it out. Alternatively, as usual
using Blizzard would lead to Icy Field, from which you can go to Snowy
Mountain and then Volcanic Top, Mountain, Dragon's Den, and so on, all
of which would of course ruin Wailord's strategy. Another alternative
is, as we've seen before, just lowering its stats crazy low. Good news
is it only uses Physical moves, so you can deplete its attack with
Intimidate, Feather Dance, etc. Then a couple Fake Tears / Acid Sprays
will allow you and Goomink's Thunderbolt to knock its entire HP bar to
zero, even if it Rests the turn before. Anyways, you can do it!

Back on land, you'll have to face a team AA grunt as the Hero Goomink.
It's not too hard with two Sacred Swords, luckily. Afterwards, fly back
to the Kingdom of Goomidra. Make your way to the castle and battle the
grunts as you go up. After the events at the top of the tower, head back
to the throne room, and talk to the king. You'll get MegaStone
*Swampertite* and *Infernape Crest!*

Head down the hallway to the right, into the ruins room. The first fight
you do you will likely lose against Big Betty, but the second you can
win by using Swords Dance -\> King's Shield -\> Thousand Arrows -\>
King's Shield -\> Thousand Arrows -\> King's Shield -\> Thousand Arrows
-\> Thousand Arrows.

Concluding the quest grants Relationship Points (Ben +6, Goomink +6,
Karma +5).

After these events, re-enter the ruins room. While here, grab *TM08 Bulk
Up.*

Castle of Goomidra

You can also exit the castle out of the southwest entrance to find some
grass, with a hidden *Dusk Ball* and *Big Mushroom* nearby.

*Bastiodon Crest* $100000

*Dedenne Crest* $100000

*Rampardos Crest* $100000

*Whiscash Crest* $100000

## Zorrialyn Labyrinth 2<sup>nd</sup> Visit

Next, fly to Alamissa Urben and go straight up. Take the unconscious
Karen back to the village, then agree to go to the labyrinth again. Add
any Water/Rock type to your party - by now we've seen Relicanth,
Tirtouga line, Drednaw, Corsola, Kabuto line, Omanyte line, Binacle line
that all should work.

With that out of the way, head to the Zorrialyn Labyrinth. Make your way
to the third floor just as we did before. Follow the southmost path to
the east, until you reach a sign. Talk to the sign and show your
Water/Rock type to it. Then, head north and west to reach the dive spot.

Note that in this area we can catch Relicanth, Clamperl, Luvdisc. We're
gonna do three more runs to explore this area of the ruins and snag all
the items. Do so as follows:

1: DLU, get *Relic Silver*. Go straight down and grab *Mind Plate.* ULU,
pick up *Calcium.* Enter the door and get the *Skuntank Crest.* DRD,
pick up a *Heart Scale.* L, D all the way, RD. In this big room, grab
the *Heart Scale* and the *Relic Silver.* URUR to get *Blue Shard.*
Then, I was booted.

2: DR, enter the door for *Relicanth Crest.* R, grab *Splash Plate.*
DRDL, grab *Pixie Plate*. DR, grab the *Full Restore.* D into a big
room, pick up the *PP Up, Dread Plate,* and *Water Stone.* This is all
the items we can collect, so I was booted shortly after.

3: To progress, knock out 4 Luvdisc in the map. There's one in the
southwest corner, one in the southeast corner, one in the big room on
the east side, and one in the northeast room. After, head to the middle
south part of the map, and go in. Get the *Zap Plate.* Then, use dive in
the sandy spot here. Attempt to grab the item ball and win the fight
against the team. Get the *Cofagrigus Crest*!

Afterwards, head to the top of this map and enter the door on top with
the incantation. Head up and agree to help Karen.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Yeah, sure why not? (Karen +1)  
- Maybe tomorrow. (Karen -1)  

Note that leaving before the quest is over grants (Karen -1)
relationship points.

Fight the AA grunt. Exit out the right door, then fight the AA grunt
here. Press this switch and exit through the teleporter. Now, follow the
stairs on the left up.

Interact with the purple bookshelf on the left. You'll get Relationship
Points (Karen +2)! Follow the secret path. Grab the *Eviolite* in the
library, then the *Claydol Crest* outside! Go back through and enter the
door down in the area with the stairs.

Immediately go left and go down the stairs here. Follow this path to a
door to grab the *Spiritomb Crest.* Then head back to the open area and
head all the way to the right, to grab the *Darmanitan Crest* in the
door here.

Cross the bridge near the AA grunt. Go straight up and follow this path
all the way through until the top of the castle. After a scene, start
heading down the castle. After two sets of stairs, you'll notice a cave
has opened at the top, so head in to catch **Larvesta!**

Head back out, but when you reach a fork, head left and go up the stairs
here to get onto the area where Karen and Karrina are fighting.

Gang Leader Karrina (Blessed Field)

-   Musharna, Level 84. @ Amplified Rock.

    -   Gravity

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Psyshock

    -   Hypnosis

-   Granbull, Level 84. @ Babiri Berry.

    -   Play Rough

    -   Dynamic Punch

    -   Fire Punch

    -   Earthquake

-   Nidoking, Level 85. @ Life Orb.

    -   Blizzard

    -   Fire Blast

    -   Earth Power

    -   Superpower

-   Durant, Level 85. @ Rockium-Z.

    -   Iron Head

    -   Stone Edge

    -   X-Scissor

    -   Return

-   Alakazam, Level 85. @ Life Orb.

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Gravity

    -   Psyshock

    -   Zap Cannon

-   Fearow, Level 86. @ Fearow Crest.

    -   Facade

    -   Drill Peck

    -   Drill Run

    -   Return

A formidable team, but nothing you can't handle. If you let Alakazam or
crest Fearow come out while the rest of your surviving team is too
slow/weak to take them out, you're gonna be hurting a lot in this one.
You also must watch out for Durant, who will surprise you with a speedy
Continental Crush. That said, you can probably easily find a way through
this one: Curse, Phantom Force, Spectral Scream, Shadow Force, Ominous
Wind, Trick-or-Treat are moves which all switch the field to Haunted
Field if you want to: Alakazam, Musharna, and Fearow would all go down
quickly to field boosted Ghost moves. She doesn't benefit too much from
the base Blessed Field either, so you can exploit that for your victory
too.

Afterwards, you'll get a choice. If you choose the first, you will get
Life Orb in a bit. If you choose the second, you'll get the second mega
stone from the Hidden Library way back when, but get (-5 Karma).

If you chose the second option, at the top, make a second choice. If you
choose No, you'll then get MegaStone *Banettite* or MegaStone
*Heracronite.* If you choose Yes, then the stone will be shining on the
ground as you make your way through the tower.

Either way, head back to where you fought Karrina, and head to the
right. Go up to grab the *Torterra Crest!* Exit the castle now.

If you chose the first option, fly to Alamissa Urben and enter a door
all the way on the left, accessed via the top left side of the area.
Grab the *Life Orb!* You can also read the journal if you'd like.

In either case, with all the crests that we found in the crypt, fly to
Sashila and talk to the left merchant for some lore, and a *Dusknoir
Crest!*

## Aquarium Side Quest

Now that we've been diving, there is a side quest we can do. Head to the
Akuwa Town Aquarium. Back in the SOS room, talk to the director, who
will ask us for help with the aquarium. The Pokemon we need to submit

Now that we have the Super Rod, there are a whole bunch of areas that
now hold strong water Pokemon. The Super Rod tables for the areas we
have been so far are as follows:

## Ana Quest Part 3

If you've completed all the steps to the Ana questline so far, make your
way to GDC.

At Pokestar Studios, head up, then talk to Ana on the right. Follow her
to the left again, let the scenes play out, then at Dylan's place again,
exit and go down and right*.* In the north side, battle through a
gauntlet of trainers to proceed. At the docks, talk to the pair to end
up in Kristiline Town.

After a conversation in his house, follow Ana to the Sapphire Museum.
Talk to her, then follow her to the Lava Cookie house above. After that
conversation, go back to Dylan's and talk to her there. Talk to her once
more in front of the Pokemon Center.

Use the boat to get to Teila Resort and go to the lighthouse area of the
cave via the hole Amber fell through. You'll get 5 *Lava Cookies!*

Back in Kristiline, you'll get offered to go to Teila Resort. Head there
and talk to Ana in the middle. Gather intel from the townspeople then
talk to her again. We don't need to win the challenge, but if you'd like
to, choose these options from her questions: first, fourth, second. Then
talk to Gigiorno in the middle to get it started.

Back in Kristiline again, enter the house. That's all we can do in this
quest for now!

...While we're on Terajuma, fly to Kakori Village. Enter the
bottom-right house and present the *Magic Wand* to get **Fennekin!**

## Hospital of Ruin (2nd Visit)

Time to continue the story! Fly to Yui's Ranch, then enter GDC and make
your way to the penthouse. After a quick scene, talk to Delpha and agree
to go.

Enter Isha's backroom prepared for battle.

Doctor Isha (Factory Field)

-   Galarian Weezing, Level 85. @ Black Sludge.

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Toxic

    -   Strange Steam

    -   Flamethrower

-   Vanilluxe, Level 84. @ Icy Rock.

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Hidden Power Fire

    -   Blizzard

    -   Freeze Dry

-   Arctozolt, Level 84. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Blizzard

    -   Bolt Beak

    -   Surf

    -   Hail

-   Magnezone, Level 85. @ Synthetic Seed.

    -   Discharge

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Hidden Power Ice

    -   Signal Beam

-   Dusknoir, Level 86. @ Dusknoir Crest.

    -   Shadow Punch

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Earthquake

    -   Thunderpunch

-   Dracovish, Level 84. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Fishious Rend

    -   Crunch

    -   Psychic Fangs

    -   Ice Fang

-   Giratina, Level 86. @ Griseous Orb. \[ONLY IF YOU DID NOT SAVE IT,
    REPLACES WEEZING\]

    -   Outrage

    -   Aura Sphere

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   Earthquake

This fight can potentially be tough - it mixes a lot of strategies and
works somewhat well with the factory and dark factory fields. Weezing is
pretty tanky and can spread Toxic but isn't too crazy. Arctozolt and
Dracovish both hit hard but are on the slower side, so hitting them hard
with Ground / Fairy / Dragon moves respectively is the way to stop them.
Crest Dusknoir hits hard with Shadow Sneak on the Dark Factory - make
sure that whatever you are going to attack it with can live a Technician
Shadow Sneak. And, if you could take Giratina back in your Level 30's,
you can now.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I've been great! (Venam +3)  
- It's been going. (Neutral)

After the rest of the cutscenes play out… we did it! There are a couple
quests we can take care of right now before progressing the story
further.

As a note, if we head over to the Pokemon Hospital south from here, we
can spend $50000 at night to max out one EV, max out one IV, and give
Pokerus to a single Pokemon. This is really only critical for the IV
itself, but the price is high. Up to you if you have a particularly bad
IV.

Head over to the Botanical Gardens if Florin is still alive.

Relationship Point Choices:
- That's great, Florin! (Florin +2)  
- You? Mayor? (Florin -2) 

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'd love to! (Florin +2)  
- Sorry, I'm busy... (Florin -2)

## Narcissa's Quest (Final)

Head over to Goldenleaf Town. Talk to Narcy by her house. Follow her to
her house and head upstairs. Read her journal, then head out.

You'll need something with Dark Pulse or Night Daze - the easiest is the
Spiritomb we caught earlier which comes with Dark Pulse. Add it to your
party and head down to Phasial Cave, using Rock Climb to descend to a
lower level.

Phasial Cave Crystal Area (Crystal Cavern Field)

|             |          |
|-------------|----------|
| Cave | % |
| Meowth      | 40       |
| Chewtle     | 24       |
| Silicobra   | 20       |
| Bibarel     | 9        |
| Wooper      | 6        |
| Venipede    | 1        |

Talk to Narcissa once you cross the bridge, grab the *Ability Capsule.*

Next, fly to the Rose Theater, and enter Forlorned Cavern on Route 9.
Enter the first room in the main area of the cave, with the time stone.
After a scene with Narcissa, accept the fast travel to the Cliffside
Grave if you've been already -- if not, follow the path earlier in the
game to Rift Chandelure. Talk to her again, then head to Phasial Cave.

Head up and watch the scenes play out. Then, in Narcissa's house, talk
to her upstairs. Head out and go to the Wispy Tower. Talk to young Narcy
here and go in. Enter the lab, and head left. Talk to her again. Enter
the western room, and surf up. Watch the CD Rom, then return to
Narcissa's house and talk to them again. Accept fast travel.

Follow the Rotom into the cave, then take the time crystal to the past.
Interact with the safe here. Then, pull the lever in the top left
corner, hiding in boxes. Go down the ladder and out. Here you can find
hidden *Revival Herb* and *Full Heal,* and a *Health Wing* in the first
floor right room. Unlock the gate, and head in. Pick up a hidden *Blue
Shard,* then talk to her at the top, then the box.

After a scene, talk to Narcissa and agree to go. Enter the manor and
head upstairs. Go through the back, then go upstairs again. Make your
way to the bottommost room, with the fireplace. After a scene, enter the
fireplace, then talk to the safe after another scene for a *Fairy
Memory.* Exit to the well in the backyard.

Grab the Rift Notes for Code: Rembrence…

Dimensional Rift Dufaux (Bewitched Field)

-   Froslass (Dufaux Form), Level 90. @ Metronome. Ability: Temporal
    Shift. 4 Shields.

    -   Poison Gas

    -   Discharge

    -   Ice Beam

    -   Moonblast

Form 1: Electric/Fairy, Stats: 500/60/250/130/250/60

Form 2: Electric/Ice, Stats: 500/60/130/300/130/180

This is another potentially tough fight, this time, difficult for
opposite reasons than the Wailord. Its ability prevents stat loss, so
our normal strategy doesn't work as well here. Luckily Narcissa's
Gothitelle likes to use Light Screen on Turn 1, so take advantage of
those turns to batter the shields! The second form isn't too defensive
so you can wear it down if you can survive - Trick Room is an excellent
choice.

After a scene in Goldenleaf which grants Relationship Points (Narcissa
+6), you'll be free to head to the Lost Castle. All the way at the top,
you'll get a chance to battle **Rotom!**

Fly to West Gearen and go talk to Gabriel at the West Gearen power
plant. Follow him left then up then up again to get access to a room
where you can change Rotom's form! You'll also get the seventh
*Department Store Stamp!*

## Department Store and Deino

Next, fly over to the GDC and enter the department store. We've gotten a
ton of stamps in this episode's content, so it's time to go on a
shopping spree! Add Gible to your party and fly to Yui's Ranch, enter
GDC, then go to the shopping district and into the store.

## Zygarde 10% Form

There's just one more thing we can do… If you've noticed, we've
collected a lot of Zygarde Cells. Return to Gearen City to talk to
Ayuda.

Fly to Sashila and make your way to the end of Sand Stream Cave the same
way as we did earlier in the game. Once you have, in the back room,
grab:

ZCore 1: Sand Stream Cave

<img src="/assets/media/rejuv/image110.png"
style="width:6.63542in;height:5.02083in" />

Fly back to Gearen and talk to Ayuda to get **Zygarde 10%!** It's not
even particularly better than the Gible we got earlier, but hey another
legendary!

Finally, to progress the story, return to the penthouse and talk to
Melia.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Full-time? (Reina +1)

- Part-time? (Neutral)

# Chapter 15: Vague Clarity

## League Administration 1<sup>st</sup> Visit

### Day 01: Vs. Melia

In Sashila, head up when prompted. You'll be thrown into a battle as
Alexandra.

The Storm (Desert Field)

-   STORM \| Wind, Level 80. @ Demon Stone. Type: Flying. Ability:
    Tempest. Stats: 450/70/150/140/150/20.

    -   Weather Ball

    -   Hurricane

    -   Thunder

    -   Psyshock

You can defeat this thing easily. Notice what weather gets activated by
its ability each turn and try to use moves boosted by it if you want,
but with Damien on your side it's very winnable.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Count me in! (Melia +3, Aelita +3, Ren +3, Venam +2,
Alexandra +6)  
- I'm scared... (Ren +2, Aelita +2, Erin +2, Damien +2)  
- What are we talking about? (Erin -3, Melia -3, Ren -3,
Aelita -5, Damien -6, Alexandra -6, Allen +3)

Me too, Allen.

Enter Alexandra's secret passageway and enter at the top.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You mean Marianette? (Venam +2)  
- My third badge? (Neutral)  
- What? (Neutral)

Afterwards, prepare yourself for a battle with Melia!

Pokemon Trainer Melia (Fairy Tale Field)

-   Hydreigon, Level 85. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Flamethrower

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Dragon Pulse

    -   Protect

-   Azombarill (real ones know!), Level 84. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Play Rough

    -   Liquidation

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Aqua Jet

-   Mimikyu, Level 84. @ Magical Seed.

    -   Swords Dance

    -   Play Rough

    -   Shadow Claw

    -   Shadow Sneak

-   Snorlax, Level 84. @ Chople Berry.

    -   Return

    -   Earthquake

    -   Heavy Slam

    -   Heat Crash

-   Togekiss, Level 85. @ Babiri Berry.

    -   Aura Sphere

    -   Gilded Arrows (Flying Type)

    -   Nasty Plot

    -   Draining Kiss

-   Aegislash, Level 85. @ Magical Seed.

    -   King's Shield

    -   Swords Dance

    -   Shadow Sneak

    -   Sacred Sword

Gilded Arrows: Type is the same as the user's secondary type, unless the
user is single-typed or their secondary type is Dragon or Fairy, in
which case the type is the user's primary type \| Special \| 50 power,
hits twice \| 100% accuracy \| Increased critical hit rate.

The field effect is unalterable by moves, a broken seed effect that
gives Aegislash one and Mimikyu TWO free turns turn to reach +4/+6
attack, all fire moves given an added Dragon typing hence can't touch
Togekiss, Mimikyu or Azumarill and are now neutral against Aegislash,
it's very stacked against you.

The good news is that you are given a couple options to make this fight
work in your favor. For one, Steel moves also get a 1.5x boost and hit
dragons super effectively, so they hit half of her team hard. Bullet
Punch is a savior here. Snorlax with its berry will probably live one
hit but doesn't particularly have synergy with the field, so if you can
lower its attack or burn it, that may be your opportunity to set up.
Normal types are immune to Aegislash and Mimikyu's Ghost Attacks, so
since they are not the fastest in the world a speedy normal type capable
of knocking them out in one attack (after Disguise) might be the way to
go. I might have cried when I saw that this field made its way into this
game, but if I can overcome it you can too!

To win, you'll receive the *Fate Badge!*

Outside, talk to Melia again.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Jenner was your father. (Melia +3)  
- That's kinda cool! (Melia -3)

Tell Alexandra you're ready for training.

### Day 03: Aelita's Departure

This day is just a quick scene!

### Day 08: MC's Training 

Talk to Ren in the hallway.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Talk to her next time (Ren +2)  
- You need some work... (Neutral)

Then, enter the battle room.

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'm pumped. (Erin +2, Damien +2)  
- I'm excited, I guess... (Erin +1)  
- Eh... (Erin -1, Damien -2)

Enter the rental battle with Venam. The strategy that worked for me was:
Switch Manectric for Walrein, Waterfall on Houndoom turn 1. Then turn 2
was Blizzard with Walrein and Waterfall on Dugtrio, turn 3 was mega +
discharge, waterfall on Dugtrio, then turn 4 was discharge + high
horsepower to finish off Kingler.

### Day 11: Aelita's Return

Head in to talk to Aelita.

Relationship Point Choices:
- ...The statues? (Aelita +2)  
- The Soul Stone (Aelita +1)  
- I have no idea... (Aelita -1)

Relationship Point Choices:
- I don't remember... (Neutral)  
- It couldn't have been me... (Neutral)  
- ... (Damien -2)

Interact with the obelisk! Inside it's straightforward. You'll get the
*Interceptor's Wish!*

### Day 15: Melia Vs. Erin

Back in the league administration you'll be thrusted into a 1v1 battle
as Melia. Win or lose, it doesn't matter.

### Day 18: MC's Day of Training, Pt. 2

Talk to Aelita in the hallway.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You'll be the Sensei too! (Aelita +3)  
- What about GDC? (Aelita -1)

Next is a fight with Ren, one that will pit you against Ren on a
disadvantageous field with a disadvantageous team. I chose the Fire team
here and, while a tough battle, you can win by starting with Marowak and
Heatmor, targeting Slowbro and then sending in Pyroar to finish off
Mantine then Dewgong with Wild Charges.

Sleep for the night in the leftmost room.

### Day 29: Graduation

Finally, we get to obtain the *Mega-Z Ring!* This allows us to use
Z-Moves as well as Mega Evolve our Pokemon!

Relationship Point Choices:
- Thank you, everyone! (Melia +2, Ren +2, Aelita +3, Damien
+1, Alexandra +3, Erin +1)  
- I can't believe it... (Melia +1, Aelita +2, Ren +1, Erin
+1)  
- Cool... I guess. (Aelita -1, Melia -1, Alexandra -2, Erin
-1, Venam -1, Ren -1, Allen +5, Alice +5)

Again, Allen is a real one.

Once you get control, take the time to fly over to Eclysia Pyramid if
you'd like. Head up the stairs to the right and follow the path: you'll
be able to fight **Galarian Corsola** up here!

Then, head back to League Administration. Interact with the thing at the
table and select Path 1.

## Diamond Route

During the conversation Erin and Kanon have on the boat, if you had
previously spoken to Erin in the Magnolia Library towards the beginning
of the game, you'll get Relationship Points (+2 Erin).

On the boat, choose whether you'll activate Interceptor's Wish. If you
do, Erin will be using *your team,* whereas if you don't, she uses hers.
Battle advice is easier to give when I know what your team is gonna be,
so for this guide I will not be activating it.

Follow the underwater path. Inside the manor, avoid the Regice, as
you'll have to fight them. Make your way through the path here, watch
the scene in the courtyard, then head onto the roof.

Follow the path to the right, then talk to Angie on the rooftop. Enter
the left door and beat the maid. Take the left door on the higher floor
in this complicated room, then beat the maids as you follow the path.
Back in the Shellder room, head east onto the rooftop, this time
following the path right through the dance room!

Enter the window to the baby's room, then follow the path down the
stairs. Try to exit the bottom door in the next room. After a
conversation with Kanon return to the rooftop. Head back out the window
at the bottom, then drop down the first spot on the roof you can from
the right.

Inside, get the *Dungeon Key* and talk to the book for some relationship
points (Erin +4, Kanon +4). After exiting the office on top, go left,
down, across the outside area, left through the lower level left door,
then left, up, and left into the Ballroom.

Ice Soldiers Erin and Kanon (No Field)

-   Absol, Level 90. @ NeverMeltIce.

    -   Ice Shard

    -   Icicle Crash

    -   Blizzard

    -   Scald

-   Salamence, Level 90. @ NeverMeltIce.

    -   Ice Shard

    -   Icicle Crash

    -   Blizzard

    -   Scald

Nothing too bad: Blizzard from Ampharos can take care of Salamence and
Florges can take Absol.

Get the *Dungeon Key* up at the top of this room, then make your way
back to the big hub room and use it to enter the courtyard.

Step on the red tile. Beat the maids as you follow the path. Enter the
ship and head downstairs. Then, talk to Patty in the nearby room and
beat the maid. Next, reenter the cellar and defeat the maid looking at a
wall. Return to Bonita, then head upstairs to get another *Dungeon Key.*

Enter the locked door in the cellars. After you see all of the scenes
here, back in the dungeon, exit to the left. Back in the courtyard, head
to the top door to confront Angie.

Angie and Cera (Frozen Dimensional Rift Field)

-   Mamoswine, Level 83. @ Elemental Seed.

    -   Ice Shard

    -   Icicle Crash

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Earthquake

-   Beartic, Level 84. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Play Rough

    -   Low Kick

    -   Icicle Crash

    -   Rock Slide

-   Walrein, Level 85. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Surf

    -   Cold Truth

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Stomping Tantrum

-   Rotom Freeze, Level 83. @ Chople Berry.

    -   Cold Truth

    -   Discharge

    -   Will-o-Wisp

    -   Blizzard

-   Morpeko, Level 83. @ Elemental Seed.

    -   Power Trip

    -   Aura Wheel

    -   Fake Out

    -   Seed Bomb

-   Ursaring, Level 83. @ Life Orb

    -   Ice Punch

    -   Throat Chop

    -   Return

    -   Play Rough

This one can be tough, but not as bad as our first encounter with Angie.
Erin's Aevian Ampharos is good here, able to survive a decent chunk of
the ice attacks and then hit back like a Truck. I would recommend
starting with something fast like Zangoose on the left side and Ampharos
on the right, then focus all your attacks on Angie's Pokemon (Mamoswine,
Beartic, Walrein) to start, since they're all the most threatening. Once
you knock them out Cera's three are easy to knock out.

That's it for the Diamond Route!

## Pearl Route

Again, you'll be given the choice to activate the Interceptor's wish. I
choose not to for this guide.

As Melia, take a stroll around the town. Head into the Pokemart, then
defeat Sariah.

In the grove, talk to the Arceus statue. Head down and prepare for a
battle. You get to pick whether Ren or Venam is your partner, or perhaps
you can do it alone if you want.

Rogue Psychic Lorna (Blessed Field)

-   Vivillon, Level 83. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Rage Powder

    -   Irritation

    -   Sleep Powder

    -   Hurricane

-   Aromatisse, Level 84. @ Sitrus Berry.

    -   Trick Room

    -   Mystical Fire

    -   Moonblast

    -   Light Screen

-   Darmanitan, Level 85. @ Darmanitan Crest.

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Psychic

    -   Will-o-Wisp

    -   Focus Blast

-   Stonjourner, Level 84. @ Weakness Policy.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Body Press

    -   Heat Crash

    -   Protect

-   Aevian Lapras, Level 85. @ Magical Seed.

    -   Blizzard

    -   Hypnosis

    -   Psychic

    -   Nature Power

-   Fused Solrock, Level 85. @ Life Orb.

    -   Rock Slide

    -   Zen Headbutt

    -   Solar Flare

    -   Trick Room

I picked Ren, and this was a cakewalk compared to last time. Let Mega
Snorlax come out during the trick room and it will go first and can hit
hard with Heavy Slam, and the rest of yours and Ren's Pokemon can fill
in the rest.

In the Den of Souls, head up. You'll have to defeat a couple more mechs!
Afterwards, follow the path to the right and find the open building.
Explore upstairs then head out. We're looking for three green rods: one
is hidden up and to the right, another is up from where we found Ren,
and the other is near where we started. Reactivate the generator.

Prepare to fight a mech Gyarados!

Defense Mech Gyarados (Crystal Cavern)

-   Defense Mech Gyarados, Level 90. @ Sitrus Berry. Ability: Liquid
    Voice. Type: Water/Steel. Stats: 300/110/150/100/150/51

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Hyper Beam

    -   Signal Beam

    -   Scald

Every time it attacks, it attacks twice. Luckily, it's not too hard with
Ren assisting - Meganium's Light Screen will help you survive.

Afterwards, return to the building and head upstairs. Head back out and
go up when you're ready.

Team Xen Madelis (Crystal Cavern)

-   Cinccino, Level 84. @ Life Orb.

    -   Bullet Seed

    -   Rock Blast

    -   Tail Slap

    -   Wake Up Slap

-   Crobat, Level 85. @ Flying Gem.

    -   Acrobatics

    -   Tailwind

    -   Cross Poison

    -   U-Turn

-   Tsareena, Level 84. @ Assault Vest.

    -   Trop Kick

    -   Play Rough

    -   Power Whip

    -   Low Kick

-   Florges, Level 85. @ Leftovers.

    -   Toxic

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Synthesis

    -   Giga Drain

-   Salazzle, Level 85. @ Charcoal.

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Foul Play

    -   Fake Out

-   Houndoom, Level 85. @ Houndoominite.

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Sunny Day

    -   Sludge Bomb.

This is a tough fight in general, but I found a pretty easy way to win
with Melia's team. Simply knock out Cinccino and damage Crobat with Mega
Snorlax's Return, then when it goes down swap to Mimikyu. Swords Dance,
Shadow Sneak to finish Crobat. Then Play Rough to Shadow Sneak Houndoom
who should turn the field dark, then Shadow Sneak Salazzle to one shot
it, then Play Rough Tsareena. Now it will go down but Hydreigon,
Gardevoir, and Meganium can deal with the rest.

Head up and into this building. Make your way up, battling grunts as you
go. When you reach the gatling gun, spam the up arrow. Enter the door
after defeating the mechs and grab the shining key. Enter the door on
the right: read each letter in each open room and open the next door.
Finally, enter the last door in this area and go up. Make your way
through and watch the scenes, and when you're able, exit back to where
we started. Take the elevator up, then the second elevator to the Den of
Souls.

After a scene, head up.

Team Xen Admin Cassandra (Blessed Field)

-   Shadow Bisharp, Level 84. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Shadow Break

    -   Stealth Rock

    -   Iron Head

    -   Night Slash

    -   Brick Break

-   Lycanroc, Level 86. @ Life Orb.

    -   Stone Edge

    -   Drill Run

    -   Psychic Fangs

    -   Close Combat

-   Serperior, Level 85. @ Flame Plate.

    -   Hidden Power Fire

    -   Dragon Pulse

    -   Leaf Storm

    -   Giga Drain

-   Aevian Milotic, Level 85. @ Babiri Berry.

    -   Coil

    -   Gunk Shot

    -   Play Rough

    -   Recover

-   Cinccino, Level 85. @ Cinccino Crest.

    -   Return

    -   Play Rough

    -   Retaliate

    -   Knock Off

-   Mawile, Level 86. @ Mawilite.

    -   Play Rough

    -   Iron Head

    -   Sucker Punch

    -   Swords Dance

This is a tough battle as Cassandra has a lot of threats, and if you're
playing as Melia's team, well, then Serperior, Cinccino and Lycanroc can
outspeed your entire team. As such you need to leverage your team
correctly - for instance, Togekiss can easily dispatch the Shadow
Bisharp and Serperior, while Meganium can tank Cinccino and chip Mega
Mawile well. Aevian Milotic will go down to a couple of Earthquakes from
Mega Snorlax, and Mimikyu is a good choice to throw out a Swords Dance
boosted move when you need it. Even if it takes a couple tries Cassandra
is easily beaten with the right approach.

That's it for the Pearl Route!

    -   Outrage

This has two shields. Take advantage of Granbull and Staraptor's
Intimidates, then hit it hard with your strongest moves.

After all that, find the fifth door from the bottom on the third story,
right side and enter “Dreamyard”. Enter Huey's door!

Talk to the Rapidash rider then the girl in the bottom corner. Press the
red panel here, then in the next area, follow the stairs to the next
panel. The third panel is all the way at the bottom from here. At the
top, defeat the trainer then head to the right and fight her again at
the bottom. Then follow the path to finish Huey's area.

Head outside and enter the pyramid. At the top left talk to the girl and
agree to help. Then go left and across the bridge to make friends with
Grigus. Battle Huey, but intentionally lose to progress. You'll be
awarded 10 *Phantom Candy S!*

Pick a partner or choose to go alone, time to fight Grigus.

Axis High Student Random Student (No Field)

-   Coffee Grigus, Level 87. @ Demon Stone.

    -   Sky Uppercut

    -   Ice Hammer

    -   Meteor Mash

    -   Shadow Punch

It has three shields and hits twice; however, this fight is very easy.
Spam your strongest moves and you'll easily win. Pick up the piece of
the treasure afterwards! Head back into the main room, you'll find the
invisible person near the bottom. Talk to the girl at the top then enter
this new room at the bottom.

Grab the thing when you get a chance and head back to the main room to
reassemble the bridge. Enter Aelita's door!

Talk to both pink bookshelves then the pink plant. Then follow cyborg
Deagan! Talk to each nurse from behind, then head out once Deagan
touches the sunflower.

Doctor Isha (Factory Field)

-   Galarian Weezing, Level 85. @ Rocky Helmet.

    -   Strange Steam

    -   Sludge Bomb

    -   Pain Split

-   Hydreigon, Level 87. @ Metronome.

    -   Dark Pulse

    -   Dragon Pulse

    -   Nasty Plot

    -   Roost

Easy enough for your team!

Once this part finishes up, interact with the box outside. Time for
another battle!

Masked Man ??? (Desert Field)

-   Girafarig, Level 87. @ Twisted Spoon.

    -   Psychic

    -   Nasty Plot

    -   Hyper Voice

    -   Energy Ball

-   Komala, Level 87. @ Muscle Band.

    -   Sucker Punch

    -   Zen Headbutt

    -   Thrash

-   Comfey, Level 87. @ Big Root.

    -   Draining Kiss

    -   Giga Drain

    -   Leech Seed

    -   Calm Mind

-   Hippowdon, Level 88. @ Leftovers.

    -   Earthquake

    -   Sand Tomb

    -   Ice Fang

    -   Slack Off

If you can get some chip damage off on Hippowdon with Cherrim and
Granbull, Hawlucha can take care of most of this team.

Return to the auditorium, then reenter the Pyramid area where we fought
Grigus, then return to the auditorium. Go up here, then follow the path
to Lavender's door.

Enter the moon base and grab the crimson quartz in the upper room then
heat it in the bottom. Head out… and we must run away from Risa!! Don't
let yourself get hit too many times. Maneuver your way through the path,
hitting switches as you go. Press the last green switch then back into
the hallway and go up. Get the thing here then push the button and head
down and to the right.

Grapple to the right and then do so again. Follow the path to the yellow
switch in here, then in the previous room head down. Follow the path
here to the green switch then return and go up. Through here you'll have
to fight Risa. This one is impossible with Lavender's team, but that's
ok.

Up in the next room try to escape, then interact with the panel. Now we
have a real team for a real fight!

Pop Star Risa Raider (Factory Field)

-   Reshiram, Level 90. @ Wise Glasses.

    -   Dragon Claw

    -   Fusion Flare

    -   Earth Power

    -   Crunch

Winning this one seems to rely on luck, but oh well. Yawn first turn
with Espeon, then Pyrokinesis with Delphox. Swap in Exeggutor next and
spam Pyrokinesis as much as you can while it's asleep, then put in Mega
Alakazam when it wakes up and kills you. Thunder Wave it, then High Jump
Kick and Play Rough from your remaining members should do just enough.
If it wakes up too early and always hits through paralysis, you might
still lose though, so a couple resets may be in order.

That's it for this part!

## MC School Route

Exit the auditorium and talk to the student here who has lost his brain.
SEC is the storekeeper here and has the same items as Zetta did. Do a
group investigation of the cafeteria here. Return to the guy to get
*Mysterious Black Box* and some *Phantom Candy S.* The first trainer to
the top will also give us *Phantom Candy S.*

Talk to the masked man and you'll be given a clue. Enter the classroom
and do a group investigation. Return and try entering “ants troubled” if
you like. The actual answer is “student labor.”

Enter a room on the left and say you don't want to battle to battle
someone. Win to get *Phantom Candy S* and another *Mysterious Black
Box.* In the top left room answer the bottom answer, and you'll get
*Phantom Candy M* and another *Mysterious Black Box.* Try to enter the
machine in the lower area of the main room. Talk to it again. You'll
need to generate different students based on their attributes, the
chalkboards in the lower left classroom are the guide. So, make the
following:

1.  Determined, Math, Medical Proficiency, Internship Experience

2.  Studious, English, Drama Proficiency, 10 or more performances

3.  Whimsical, Botany, Botanical Proficiency, Hugged a Tree.

    -   Flare Blitz

    -   Extrasensory

    -   Thunderpunch

This one is somewhat tough but luckily not as bad as Mt. Valor! You'll
need to watch out for Absol, who critical hits frequently thanks to its
ability and item. The Typhlosion, Dragonite, Weavile, Minior we've all
seen before and know how to deal with by now. Watch out for Hitmonlee
who will get an Unburden boost after using Fake Out.

Relationship Point Choices:
- You got this Amber! (Amber +3)  
- Good luck. (Amber +2)  
- ... (Amber -2)

Inside, complete the first few tasks just as we did as Aelita. Now enter

A bit harder since you only have three this time, but nonetheless very
doable.

*Relationship Point Choices:*

- ... (Amber -1)

Make your way all the way back to the auditorium as soon as you are
prompted to.

    -   Protect

    -   Toxic

    -   Earthquake

    -   Icicle Spear

Again, probably easy for your team at this point.

Head upstairs. Interact with a terminal on the right. Your goal is to
get the red box into the green space. With enough tinkering you can
figure it out. Do this at all the other terminals around the room.

After you finish, talk to the main table thing, then go around the room
bashing suspicious walls. That is, any that don't fit it with what's
around them. Then return to the table.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Are you doing okay? (Amber +2)  
- What happened? (Neutral)  
- You done? (Saki -2, Amber -2)

Then head upstairs and enter your building on the left. Answer however
you like.

Relationship Point Choices:
- What? (Neutral)  
- Yes. (Saki -2)

Return to the underground to the broken machine in the upper left room.
It's time for a great sequence. Destroy all the robots you can find,
eventually making your way to the third floor. Bust your way through the
panels.

Relationship Point Choices:
- My body screams for more. (Saki +5, Amber +3)  
- It was awesome! (Saki +3, Amber +2)  
- It was... interesting. (Amber +1)  
- Eh. (Amber -2, Saki -3)

Take the teleporter then go up.

Masked Individual (No Field)

-   Genesect, Level 88. @ Douse Drive.

    -   Techno Blast (Water)

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Bug Buzz

    -   Shift Gear

Obviously, a fast fire move will do the trick here.

Head back to the teleporter and talk to the Saki door.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Kick ass, Saki! (Saki +3)  
- Uh... Good luck? (Saki +/-2)

Put the mannequins into pods… yikes.

Head up and interact with the monitor thing. Then go up and talk to the
box thing. Then input 7496 into the monitor. Talk to Amber then push the
red switch at the bottom then go down the newly opened stairs.

Relationship Point Choices:  
- It did. (Neutral)  
- I don't know. (Neutral)  
- I'm hungry. (Saki +2)

Then when you return head out and go down the lift.

After learning about all this, it's finally time to enter the player's
door!

This area is straight forward. When all is said and done, you'll have to
fight… your protagonist. Each protagonist has a different team, so find
the one that applies to you.

- Watch what you say. (Aelita -2)

## Axis High University 3rd Visit

When you can, return upstairs and enter the stairs at the fountain.
Follow the path to fight SEC again, who has a Shadow Machop. SEC in the
next room has a Shadow Clobbopus. Get the *Fire Stone* here then follow
the path. On the left side of the area, you'll be able to grab a
*Nightmare Fuel.*

Head up - it's time to fight illusions. You get relationship points
depending on if you're right - choosing Erick 2 grants (+6 Erick),
choosing Erick 1 grants (-4 Erick). Choosing Aelita 2 grants (-4 Aelita)
and will open you up to one more question:

Relationship Point Choices (Aelita 2 Chosen):  
- Aelita, I'm sorry... (Aelita +1)  
- Could've been more clear! (Aelita -2)

…but it is a higher net to just choose Aelita 1 no matter what.

Anyways, time for a battle!

??? Clear (Factory Field)

-   Stantler, Level 85. @ Stantler Crest.

    -   Return

-   Naganadel, Level 87. @ Life Orb.

    -   Sludge Wave

    -   Dragon Pulse

    -   Heat Wave

    -   Nasty Plot

The Naganadel has two shields, and her Stantler and Beheeyem each have
crests that make both much better. That said, if you don't let Naganadel
get too many Beast Boosts her team is overall slow and you can sweep
them with the right Pokemon.

That said, winning this battle is technically optional. Losing takes
away Relationship Points however (Aelita -1, Adam -1, Braixen -1, Erick
-1).

Relationship Point Choices:
- I'm going too! (Aelita +3)  
- I hate this. (Erick +3)  
- Uh... on second thought... (Aelita -2)

Head back up to Axis High.

another *Nightmare Fuel* as you go.

Prepare yourself for a battle and head up.

Rogue Hero Hazuki (Starlight Field on top of Fairy Tale Arena)

-   Aevian Chandelure, Level 84. @ Focus Sash.

    -   Dazzling Gleam

    -   Shadow Ball

-   Aegislash, Level 87. @ Magical Seed.

    -   Flash Cannon

    -   Shadow Ball

    -   King's Shield

    -   Sacred Sword

This is a tough battle that takes full advantage of both field effects
in play here! On the first turn, you'll notice that Chandelure's and
Corviknight's abilities cause tanky Mega Corviknight to be targeted.
This means Chandelure will likely get off a Trick Room on the first turn
which will last 8 turns on the field, greatly benefitting her slow team.
When her Aurorus comes in, the field will return to Fairy Tale since the
hail blocks out the weather, which as in the Melia fight makes
Sirfetch'd, Samurott and Aegislash particularly deadly.

That said, luckily there are no fairies this time, so Heat Wave + Sun
can work well on most of the team. You can either anticipate the Trick
Room and bring a slow team or manage to somehow knock out or prevent
Chandelure from moving on the first turn if you can. The field effects
are not ridiculously stacked against you this time though, so take
advantage of Fairy Tale Field and you will find a way to win.

Relationship Point Choices:    
- I'm so sorry. (Saki +2, Aelita +2)  
- It's going to be okay. (Neutral)  
- She was lost. (Saki -1)  
- That wasn't Hazuki. (Saki -2)

Equip the Intercept-Z to a Pokemon first and you'll have a much easier
time, but it's not necessary. It's very slow, so you can easily drop its
defenses or use Knock Off for its Leftovers and wear it down. Aelita
will help you break the 4 shields too with field boosted Dazzling Gleam.
If you use any weather, you'll change the field to nothing, which can be
useful.

Puppet Master (Starlight Field)

-   Puppet Master Darkrai, Level 85. @ Leftovers. Ability: World of
    Nightmares. Type: Dark/Psychic.

Stats: 500/1/80/80/1/1

-   Nightmare

-   Bunraku Beatdown

-   Spirit Break

-   Dream Eater

Even easier than the first time. The Intercept-Z helps as before!

Huey is not too bad! Just make sure he doesn't get stupidly powerful
with Octillery or Glalie's moody and you'll be fine.

Now we get to play as Saki for a bit. Interact with all the … as well as
Saki's parents then pick up the phone in the upper left corner.

Back as the player, enter the first room.

Relationship Point Choices:
- Why me? (Erin -1)  
- I'm on it. (Erin +2)  
- Goddamnit... (Melia -2, Aelita -2, Erin -3)

Accept the fast travel to Axis. Head through the path then go back to
the left. You'll find **Aevian Munna** roaming about!

Follow the path up. After this scene is over, head back out and down to
Saki's gym!

| **Ampharos**         | 5        |

Make sure you catch an Aevian Litwick to show to Zumi.

Make your way through the path to the left. There is a sneakily hidden
door at the bottom of the left-most side, follow that down. Make your
way to the right and open a chest for 3 *Green Shards.* Then step on all
three of the yellow switches and make them blue.

In the next area using the rail cart, step on the switch and open the
chest for 3 *Yellow Shards.* Then follow Sakitron down from where she
starts.

In this next area, use the rail carts to go left and step on the switch.
Activate Sakitron, follow it and go left for *Exp. Candy XL.* Defeat all
the trainers in this area and a *Dungeon Key* will appear. Get it and
open the nearby door. Head down, beat the trainers and grab the *Dungeon
Key* behind them.

Before we go, we can solve a puzzle with these statues. Turn the
top-left one South, the top-right one West, the bottom-left one East,
and the bottom-right one North. You'll get an *Adamant Mint!*

Use the key above.

Man, this guy keeps showing up and is never any less annoying. First,
for some arbitrary reason, compared to all the previous encounters with
Haunted Field, this time you can't change the field at all. All his
Pokemon hit hard, and he even walks in with some of them burned, so you
can't status them. Mega-Gengar is insanely fast and with field boosted
Shadow Ball can kill almost anything, Krookodile starts strong and can
go on a Moxie rampage starting with its Z-move, Aevian Parasect's
ability guarantees it a second life after you knock it out the first
time, Unaware Clefable is as annoying as ever, and so on.

If you can knock out Clefable, a speed boosted sweeper of some sort
might be all you need to tear into his team. As before, your own ghost
types will do well here, and since some fire moves gain Ghost typing,
once you can knock out Chandelure, one might tear through him.

Push the button and enter the teleporter. Go left then down and enter
the newly opened door to get a *Master Key.*

Head into the gym door at the top and get ready for quite a battle.

Gym Leader Saki (Glitch Field + Wonder Room)

-   Aggron, Level 85. @ Synthetic Seed.

    -   Blizzard

    -   Super U.M.D. Attack

    -   Fire Blast

    -   Thunder

-   Corviknight, Level 85. @ Occa Berry.

    -   Calm Mind

    -   Rest

    -   Sleep Talk

    -   Super U.M.D. Attack

    -   Outrage

    -   Draco Meteor

    -   Slash and Burn

    -   Super U.M.D. Attack

-   Metagross, Level 89. @ Metagrossite.

    -   Super U.M.D. Attack

    -   Zen Headbutt

    -   Cosmic Power

    -   Bullet Punch

Super U.M.D. Move: Steel \| Physical \| 100 power \| 100% accuracy \|
Alternates between lowering the target's Attack & Special Attack by 1
stage each, and lower the target's Defense & Special Defense by 1 stage
each.

The first 10 or so attempts you'll have at this battle will probably be
wrapping your head around what is happening. Basically, on Glitch Field,
special defense and special attack are calculated by whichever of the
two is highest. This, plus Wonder Room, which swaps a Pokemon's raw
defense and raw special defense, means that Saki's extremely defensive
team members now hit their special moves with their defense stats: Mega
Metagross uses 150 base special attack to power field boosted Zen
Headbutt. On top of this, Super U.M.D. Attack is a 100 power physical
steel move that every single one of her team carries which alternates
between lowering your attack stats and your defense stats. Bronzong and
Aggron also have the notorious Glitch Field Synthetic Seed boost, which
grants +1 in defense and special defense as well as replacing their
types with ???, removing their weaknesses to make them very tough to
take down. Bastiodon is also very gnarly thanks to its crest which deals
recoil damage to the player and heals Bastiodon in addition to Sturdy.

That said, as one of the developers kindly told me when I was stuck,
there is an advantage built in to the field! All the Pokemon except
Mega-Metagross are slow, and on Glitch field, the faster Pokemon has a
+1 critical hit chance. This means that any Pokemon holding a Razor Claw
or Scope Lens that is faster than any of Saki's Pokemon has a 50% chance
of doing critical hits, meaning that half of the time you can ignore the
defense boosts granted by the seeds of Bronzong and Aggron. What's more,
a high crit move like Night Slash will have a 100% chance of breaking
through! Another strategy you can consider is bringing your own
defensive Pokemon. Just like with Saki's team, defense will then
translate to special attack, allowing you to hit hard Special type moves
(especially Fire). Physical type moves (especially Ground and Fighting)
are also decent here, as the wonder room swaps Saki's team members'
relatively poor special defense to the defense stat.

Win to get *TM91 Flash Cannon* as well as the Forgery Badge. At this
point, if you have at least 3 points with Saki you'll get more
Relationship Points (Saki +4, Amber +4, Venam +4).

Right afterwards, if you have at least 3 points with Amber, you'll get
even more Relationship Points! (Amber +4, Venam +4)

Relationship Point Choices:
- You got it, bro (Adam +3)  
- Sure. (Adam +1)  
- Really? Ugh... (Adam -3, Venam -2)

Next, return to Sashila, and enter the second room on the right to talk
to Crescent.

Relationship Point Choices:
- They're my friends. (Neutral)  
- None of your business. (Crescent -4)

Then enter the leftmost room to talk to everyone else. We did it! Only
side quests remain, for now.

## Post V13 Items

Return to the Gearen Lab and show your Aevian Litwick to Zumi, who'll
reward you with *Exp. Candy L* and MegaStone *Manectite.* That's the end
of this quest!

Next, make your way to the Den of Souls via Goldenwood Grove. Head up to
pick up the *HP Up.* Follow the path to the city area and find a
*Revive* on the left. Hidden here is also *Nugget, Damp Rock,* and *Red
Shard.* Make your way to the 3<sup>rd</sup> HQ, and head to the
3<sup>rd</sup> floor. In the rooms with the notes, you can grab an
*Antidote,* a *Full Heal,* a *Revival Herb.* A room to the left has an
*Elixir* in it. On the second floor, you can find a *Max Potion.*

Exit to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Layer. On the right is an *Ultra Potion.*
Down, you'll find a hidden *Rare Candy.* Head to the left. We can surf

you'll get a *Dragon Memory.* Head up to get the MegaStone *Glalitite!*
Proceed left and pick up the *Tiny Mushroom.*

Surf down at the bottom area. You'll find Wild Omanyte here, and a
hidden *Blue Shard.* To the right, you can get *TM149 Draining Kiss.*
Further to the right, you'll find a hidden *Ether.* An island on the
north side of the pond contains a hidden *Heart Scale.* Head all the way

Essence!

dex as much as possible. Note that I assume everything in bold above has
been obtained already. I will only be listing everything here that you
must evolve/breed in V13 that we haven't already done so for a quest.

The best place to post up for battles is the Route 9 grinder. Lead with
a Ghost/Fighting type and go nuts, you'll get Exp. Candy for winning.
Friendship berries are available at Maman's Camp. As for item evolutions
- they're all available in the Shopping District.
