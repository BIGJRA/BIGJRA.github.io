# Episode 13: Cascade

With 10 badges in hand, there is another default shop update.

!shop("Default Mart (10-12 Badges)", ["Pok√© Ball", "Great Ball", "Ultra Ball", "Super Repel", "Max Repel", "Escape Rope", "Full Heal", "Hyper Potion"])

Return to the Celestinine Cascade and talk to Titania inside. You'll get *TMX3 Surf*! Finally.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Titania you were reading the journal (Neutral)
- Tell Titania you weren't reading the journal (-1 Titania)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Amaria that Titania is wrong (+2 Amaria, -2 Titania)
- Tell Amaria that Titania is right (-2 Amaria, +2 Titania)

## Mountain Range Surfin'

We can't follow them down the waterfall yet, but we can now explore with Surf! One quick note:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Read Titania's diary once she is down the cascade (-1 Titania)

I'll start by exploring the rest of the area we are currently in, the Celestinine Cascade.

Surf to the left. 

!enc(359, ["Surfing"], nil, "Celestinine Cascade East")

!enc(372, nil, nil, "Celestinine Cascade West")

Hidden are *Water Gem*, 2 *Pok√©Snax*, *Potion*, *Calcium*, *Genius Wing*, *Dire Hit*, *Pok√© Ball*, *Blue Shard*, *Rock Gem*, *Green Shard*, *Awakening*, *Ultra Potion*, *Elixir*, 2 *Red Shards*, *Aspear Berry*, and *Ice Heal* all throughout the left side of this area. Hop your way to the cliff on the upper right side to get a *Reaper Cloth*. Towards the left side you can hop to an *Ultra Potion*.

Talk to the clown with the Politoed and Torkoal for a battle.

!battle(["Bindra", :INDRA, 0], "Rainbow Field atop Rocky Field")

üÖ±Ô∏èindra. Once you win against his super sketchy Rainbow team you will get a *Full Heal*! Talk to him again and say yes! Then again and say no! Finally he will give you *TM39 Rock Tomb*.

Up from here is another clown.

!battle(["Aaron", :Clown, 0], "Rocky Field")

Head up to enter Citrine Mountain! We've actually been in this mountain once before, but from a different side.

!enc(381, ["Cave", "Water", "Fishing"], ["Old", "Good"], "Citrine Mountain 1F / 3F")

Hidden on this floor you'll find 7 *Shoal Salts*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Potion*, *Revive*, *Normal Gem*, and *Heart Scale*, though the latter requires use of a Blast Powder.

On the top there is a ladder that will take us to a different side of the familiar 2F. Up here you'll find a hidden *Zinc*, and *Ultra Ball* but that's about it. Back on 1F, surf to the upper right corner to enter Celestinine Mountain 1F.

!enc(380, ["Surfing"], "Celestinine Mountain")

Hidden on this map are a *Super Potion*, and a *Full Heal*. Cross the ice to the top right, and surf to the right and grab a hidden *Ultra Ball*. Note that the bottom of this map will lead you out to the cascade we saw earlier, so use this shortcut to heal if you like.

Anyways, without Dive and Waterfall there isn't much else to do in Celestinine Mountain 1F, so go up the ladder in the top right corner.

Cross the ice puzzle to get to the left. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Up, Left, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Left to go from the right side to the left side<br/>
    Right, Down, Left, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up, Right, Down to go from the left side to the right side
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for ice puzzle movements</a>
</div>

Follow the body of water up from here to enter Ametrine Mountain 2F.

**Ametrine Mountain**

|Water             |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Wailmer           |60 |
|Seel              |30 |
|Lumineon          |5  |
|Wishiwashi        |4  |
|Dewgong           |1  |

You'll eventually notice on the right the area connected to Route 2. Now we know how all three of these mountains are connected to each other and the greater Route 2 area! We're actually going to take a quick detour back to the circus while we're so close to it.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Blake at the bottom of the circus (+1 Blake)

There's also a Pok√©mon and a few items we can get right now using Surf, albeit in a bit of an odd way. You can get them later with Rock Climb super easily, but I'll cover it now. Head back to Route 2, and grab some rage powder. Enter Ametrine Mountain 2F, then make your way all the way backwards and exit out of Celestinine Mountain into the cascade. Go to the right and use the powder on the first Crustle you see.

Inside this cave you can get an *Elemental Seed* as well as the *Aerodactylite* and a hidden *Exp. Candy XL*. You can also talk to the rock at the top to battle **Salandit**!

Unfortunately this makes it impossible to go from Celestinine Cascade to the other side of Route 2 for now. If you want to reopen this shortcut, you'll need to head back through the mountain onto Route 2 to move another Crustle into that place.

Anyways, return to Ametrine 2F, surf to the left, and cross the simple ice puzzle. Talk to Aya near the iceberg. After this scene, follow the path up and right to emerge onto Route 3.

## Route 3 & LCCC

!enc(361)

Grab the hidden *Potion*. Head right from here. And... so much for entering Calcenon City. Make your way right, picking up hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Green Shard* along the way. Aya will join us as a partner!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Return to Ametrine while Aya is your partner (-1 Aya, -1 Hardy)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Wipe out at any point with Aya as your partner (-1 Aya, -1 Hardy)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Aya while you are partnered (+1 Aya for each of 4 dialogues, +4 total)

!partner(["Aya", :AYA, 1])

!enc(405, nil, nil, "Route 3 Caves")

Inside this cave you can find a hidden *Hyper Potion*, *Red Shard*, 2 *Repels*, *Antidote*, *Ground Gem*. There's a door you can go through at the top to reach a green machine containing a *Metal Coat*!

Exit the door at the bottom. Outside, you can find a hidden *Max Elixir*, *Resist Wing*, and *Exp. Candy XL*.

Enter the next cave. Inside you can find hidden *Pok√©Snax*, and *Potion*, as well as Team Meteor!

!dbattle(["Geoff", :MeteorGrunt, 1], ["Audrey", :MeteorGrunt_090, 1], "Cave Field")

Beyond you can find a hidden *Max Potion* and *Tiny Mushroom*. In the next room, use the panel and follow the path.

In this room, you can get hidden *Repeat Ball*, *Fire Gem*, and *Great Ball*.

!dbattle(["Demian", :MeteorKnight, 0], ["Antoine", :MeteorDame, 0], "Cave Field")

Continue into the next room.

!dbattle(["Kenan", :MeteorKnight, 2], ["Diana", :MeteorDame, 2], "Cave Field")

Pick up the hidden *Super Repel* and *Pok√© Ball*. Head outside and go right. Pick up a hidden *X Defend* along the way.

!dbattle(["Steven", :MeteorKnight, 2], ["Avril", :MeteorDame, 2], "Rocky Field")

Right before the hop rocks you can get a hidden *Green Shard*. Hop down and enter the next cave.

In here, you can get a hidden *Blast Powder*, *Ultra Potion*, and *Blue Shard*. Enter the next room, change up your team if necessary, then head in to the next room.

!dbattle(["Aster", :AsterKnight, 0], ["Eclipse", :EclipseDame, 0], "Factory Field")

Time for another round with Aster and Eclipse! This time you'll have Aya as your partner, and thankfully her team actually puts in a decent amount of work in this fight, with lots of Water and Grass moves to deal with their numerous Water, Rock, and Ground type Pok√©mon. Aster and Eclipse like to set up screens against you with their leads, so you could consider bringing Brick Break or Psychic Fangs if these are annoying. Generally I find that Lunatone doesn't hit very hard, so if you are struggling with this one, you can continuously target the right side and get the battle to a 2-on-1 to make it simple.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Aya gets kidnapped (-2 Aya. This is not a choice, actually.)

After the fight, go to the left and grab *TM43 Flame Charge* in the storage room. Return to the previous room and head out from the door on the right side. In this next cave, you can get a hidden *Great Ball* and *Aspear Berry*. Head outside, pick up a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Magical Seed*, and *Blast Powder* then proceed to Route 4.

## Route 4

!enc(412, ["Grass"])

Going up the left path first:

!battle(["Odin", :HIKER, 0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Eddie", :AceTrainerM, 0], "Forest Field")

!battle(["Ellen", :NatureGirl, 0], "Forest Field")

Before going up the stairs to the left and to the right, go to the right and down to fight another trainer:

!battle(["Goro", :HIKER, 0], "Forest Field")

Climbing the stairs up and to the right, you'll find another trainer:

!battle(["Lassie", :RANGERF, 0], "Forest Field")

Finally, up the hill to the left is the last trainer here.

!battle(["George", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0], "Forest Field")

Throughout Route 4 you can find 2 hidden *Heart Scales*, *Super Potion*, 2 *Pok√©Snax*, *Purple Shard*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Red Shard*, 2 *Telluric Seeds*, *Grass Gem*, *X Attack*, and *Potion*. If you bring a Pok√©mon with Lava Plume, Heat Wave, Incinerate, Eruption, Fire Pledge, or Flame Burst, use it in battle. This will allow you to get the *Fire Memory* in the campfire at the center of the bottom half of the map.

Enter Calcenon City to the west.

## Calcenon City

Inside the Pok√©mon Center, a person will tell you about the password *noitems*. Another person in here will offer an in-game trade: your Qwilfish for **Munchlax**!

Enter the gym at the top of the city.

Talk to Hardy in the left side of the city for some points if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy and Fern on the left side of the city (+1 Fern)

Talk to Saphira here twice.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you would throw her to the dogs for the ring, while Saphira Points > 0 (+2 Charlotte, -1 Hardy, +1 Saphira)
- Tell Charlotte you would throw her to the dogs for the ring, while Saphira Points <= 0 (+2 Charlotte, -1 Hardy, -1 Saphira)
- Tell Charlotte you would not throw her to the dogs (-2 Charlotte, +1 Hardy)

Anyways, walk over to the Route 4 exit and talk to Charlotte inside. She'll tell us it's time for a gym battle, so head back into Calcenon.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Saphira and Sigmund on the west side of the city (-1 Sigmund)

## Cinder Badge

Enter Charlotte's gym when you are ready. The puzzle here is basically the same as Wallace's from generation 3: you have to carefully step on every gray tile exactly once and make it to the other side's stairs. For precise solutions:

!battle(["Nova", :AceTrainerF, 0], "Super-Heated Field")

Head up to where Charlotte is.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Open the secret room in Charlotte's gym while she is present (+1 Charlotte)

Technically you shouldn't know how to open the secret room by this point... So if you want to respect the fact accessing this room and getting this point is more of an easter egg for players on their second run, you can skip to the fight.

If you do want to open the secret room, you'll need to make the top area tiles look exactly like this:

!img("calcsecret.jpg")

When you're ready, take on the Fire type gym leader!

!battle(["Charlotte", :CHARLOTTE, 0], "Super-Heated Field")

Time for another of Reborn's double battle gym leaders. Her two leads, Darmanitan and Typhlosion, are incredibly fast and hit like trucks with their Fire moves. Eruption will turn the field to Burning Field, potentially making things more difficult. In the back she has a seeded Ninetales, who will amplify her Fire type moves even more thanks to Drought. With a bulky Rotom that can counter Water and Ground types and the speedy Heat Wave + coverage moves sets she has on her Delphox and Volcarona, Charlotte has a pretty frail but speedy and strong team that can overwhelm unprepared teams by their sheer field-boosted power.

Both the Super-Heated Field and Burning Field benefit Charlotte a lot, but they could benefit you as well. One hilarious strategy you can try is just using your own Fire types to obliterate her: use your own Eruption, Heat Wave, etc. As long as you can control for speed such as by using the Telluric Seed this tends to be reliable. If you find yourself stuck, Trick Room is an incredible strategy here - paired with Wide Guard, you can reliably set up Trick Room on the first turn with many different Pok√©mon. Under Trick Room, her entire team will crumple to slow Rock moves, Ground moves on top of Gravity, or Water moves if you can keep it on Burning to avoid the Super-Heated Field damage suppression. There are tons of other crafty doubles strategies you can use on this fight especially if you buy yourself some turns with Wide Guard, so get creative!

Once you win, you'll get the *Cinder Badge* which allows us to use Dive in the field and boosts the cap to Lv. 75. You'll also get *TM35 Flamethrower*! Very nice.
