# Postgame Episode 6: Lights Out

Rejoice, for the Level Cap is now Lv. 130!

## Triskeline Toybox

Accept Randall's quest. Fly over to the Tanzan Cove and enter the Tanzan Mountain. Enter the room on the west side of the mountain and follow the path onto the Wasteland Wall. Proceed through the strength puzzles and enter the room hidden behind the blue canister on the right once you're prepared for a fight.

Fern finally replaces his annoying Roserade... with a Buzzwole! Is that fitting or what! Speaking of, Buzzwole can go on a rampage with Power-Up Punch on top of Beast Boost, so watch out for that. Otherwise, it's same ol' Fern doing the same ol' Fern things.

Enter the New World Door once you beat him.

Welcome to the Triskeline Toybox. Jump across the pink balls to the next area. Head up three sets of stairs from here to find:

**ZCell 34: Triskeline Toybox**

!img("zcell_34.jpg")

You can actually open the two chests to the left to get 3 *EV Boosters* and an *Ability Capsule*. Head up another set of stairs to open 2 more chests, containing a *Jolly Mint* and a *Timid Mint*. Down and right from here you can open 2 more chests to get a *PP All* and the *Mewnium-Z*. To the right:

**ZCell 35: Triskeline Toybox**

!img("zcell_35.jpg")

Down from here, hop across the pink balls to reach:

**ZCell 36: Triskeline Toybox**

!img("zcell_36.jpg")

Hop to the left, make your way to the bottom left corner, and hop to the left once more. Follow this path.

**ZCell 37: Triskeline Toybox**

!img("zcell_37.jpg")

Snorlax and Charizard block two of the chests, but you can open the one on the left to get 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Head up from here:

**ZCell 38: Triskeline Toybox**

!img("zcell_38.jpg")

Open the chest to the right to find 8 *Glitter Balls*. Go down the stairs below and go right to open another chest, containing an *EV Tuner*. Climb back up the stairs to the left and hop across the pink balls:

**ZCell 39: Triskeline Toybox**

!img("zcell_39.jpg")

Hop across to the right, then go down and left. You'll see a Lapras plush: hop up from here.

A decently tough fight on the Starlight Arena, but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle.

We'll need to chase Mew around after this. You can first find it in the bottom left side of the area, disguised as Cubone. Next, you'll find it disguised as the middle of three Jigglypuff on the right side of the area. Next is as a Chikorita on a table near the entrance. Finally, return to where we fought the Anomaly and talk to it once more. Go through the New World Door!

In this cave, you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, *Red Hots*, *Ultra Ball*, *Ultra Potion*, and *Exp. Candy XL*. Halfway up the stairs, follow the path to a hidden *Dusk Ball* and:

**ZCell 40: Chrysolia Deepwoods Cave**

!img("zcell_40.jpg")

Follow the path in the Deepwoods. Grab a hidden *Normal Gem* and hop down the ledge. Cross the bridge to the left, and Fern will get trapped in a cage.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Let Fern out right away (+1 Fern)
- Make Fern beg once, then let him out (-1 Fern)
- Make Fern beg twice, then let him out (-2 Fern)
- Make Fern beg three times, then let him out (-3 Fern)
- Make Fern beg four times, then let him out (-6 Fern)

Accept the fast travel request. We'll be getting Mew later.

## The Return of Kiki?

Accept Simon's quest and fly over to Apophyll Academy. Talk to Victoria in the courtyard. We'll need to talk to various people in the courtyard that she points out, and battle them. Talk to the guy in the center a few times and beat him. The next target is someone on the second floor walkway, left side. Finally, talk to the person in the middle of the top arc of people. Once you're ready, head up.

    - Shadow Sneak

A tough fight on the Ashen Beach field. Suicune has double-strength Calm Mind with Rest, so will try to sweep you. Mega Gallade is absurdly powerful as well. Garchomp, Sniper Kingdra, and Palossand are each threatening in their own way. Finally, Marshadow is in the back, prepared to steal your stat boosts, use its Z-Move, and sweep. If you're struggling on this one, I recommend baiting out a heal from Suicune and setting up a physical sweeper in the meantime. Even with one or two Calm Minds, its moves don't have that much Base Power, so you might be able to set up and 2HKO Suicune and snowball into a sweep.

Head into the back room once you're done and catch **Marshadow**! Return to the Nightclub.

## Neo Blacksteam Fabrication

Talk to Ringmaster and accept the quest. Head over to the Blacksteam Shelter and enter the room in the back on 1F.

Talk to all the named characters in here. Head outside and talk to Aya, then return to this room and talk to her again. Next, head to the basement of the shelter. You'll find a New World Door!

With Aya as your partner, it won't be too bad. Keep her Salazzle and Naganadel alive, supporting their Heat Wave's.

Head up from here. Once Aya presses the switch, you can explore this area a bit. Head straight up and talk to Aya near the Genesects.

From the center of the room, go right and use the panel. Go up from here and team up with Arclight for a fight.

A decently tough battle with a lot of Electric types, themed around Shock Drive Genesect. Ground types will generally do well here if you can cover their weaknesses. Tailwind is a good choice to support the already speedy team that Arclight has. Just be prepared for the Genesects - Fire moves are obviously great here.

Win to get the *Shock Drive*. Return to the center - one of the computer terminals will allow us to insert the Shock Drive, which causes the room to light up. Go to the right and use the panel to remove a shutter. Next, go to the left and follow the path through an opened gate to a panel, which we can use to open a shutter at the bottom. Return to the center and remove the Shock Drive - this will cause the surges of electricity to go away, meaning we can follow the path on the left down.

Following this path, open the shutter at the bottom. Returning to the center, switch the bottom terminal back off, and the gate below you will open. Go down and through the now open path to reach another fight.

This one is themed around the Chill Drive. With Cain as an ally, thankfully this isn't too bad. We've dealt with Alolan Ninetales leads like 234901348 times by now, so I'm sure you can figure this one out. It helps that all but Aurorus and Porygon-Z are weak to Fire.

Win to get the *Chill Drive*. Return to the center and insert it. Also, reinsert the Shock Drive and use the shutter terminal at the bottom. Head up and talk to Aya. Follow the path to the left and activate the shutter.

Remove the Shock Drive and use the shutter terminal. Go down, left, then all the way to the top left corner of the room for another fight, with Titania as a partner.

The Burn Drive team. Although Titania is weak to Fire on paper, her team is pretty solid for this fight overall. Maybe it's just because her team is so solid in general. Anyways, Water, Rock, and Ground type moves will do great here, or you can double down and run your own Fire types under Sun.

You'll get the *Burn Drive* once you win. Make your way to the center and insert it, then use the shutter terminal. Make your way to the bottom right corner and use a panel to remove a shutter - a shortcut to the entrance. Head up from the center next, talking to Aya. Go to the right and talk to another panel to remove a shutter.

Return to the center and remove the Burn Drive. Go down, follow the path right and up, and talk to a panel at the end of this path. Return to the center. Activate the shutter terminal and insert the Shock Drive, then head to the right and follow the path to the top right. Talk to the machine here and activate combustion power. This will open up a path above to a tag battle with Hardy.

Finally, the Douse Drive themed team. This one is a bit harder in my opinion than the previous few just because Rain is the best weather condition. There are FOUR Bug/Steel types in this battle, so if you can change the weather to Sun or at least away from Rain, Fire types can be very useful here. Just note that Hardy's Pokémon are generally fast and frail and will die to the Water type moves, so look out for that.

Once you win, you'll get the *Douse Drive*. Head back to the top area and talk to Hardy if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy when he's with Aya in the Neo Blacksteam Fabrication (+1 Aya)

Make your way to the center, remove the Chill Drive and Shock Drive, insert the Douse Drive, and use the shutter terminal. Go down, right, and all the way up to reach a machine. Activate the steam power system - in a nearby capsule, you'll find:

!img("zcell_41.jpg")

Return to the center. Remove the Burn Drive and put in the Chill Drive, then go to the bottom right corner of the room where there is another machine. Activate the supercooling system here - in the capsule, you'll find:

**ZCell 42: Neo Blacksteam Fabrication**

!img("zcell_42.jpg")

Back in the center, put in the Shock Drive. Make your way to the bottom left corner, and activate hydroelectric power. In the capsule:

**ZCell 43: Neo Blacksteam Fabrication**

!img("zcell_43.jpg")

That about covers the goodies, so make your way back to the center. Remove all drives except for the Douse Drive and Burn Drive, then make your way around the bottom, up the left side, and to the top of the room. You'll find a **Genesect** to catch up here!

Make your way back to the center of the room, remove the remaining Drives, then exit at the bottom. Talk to Aya to view a scene, then go to the right. On Lin Route, you'll have an extra straightforward step to do here. Return to the Nightclub!

## Idyll of Pestilence & Panaceance

Accept Zero's quest, then head over to the Peridot Ward. In Seacrest's garden, you'll find a New World Door!

Either way, once you win, you'll get your next objective: collecting 5 Shaymin. The first one is right above you - they look like bushes.

Make your way up and right. In this area, you can find an *Ultra Ball*. Navigate through the massive hop rock maze at the top, then interact with the orb on the next island. At the bottom of this island is a springy grass - step on it to reach another island with the second Shaymin. Use the springy grass to return to the center.

Make your way around the center to the top left. Use the springy grass here to hop between hills. Once you reach a choice, use the leftmost one; at the next, use the bottom one. Grab the orb at the top of this hill, then use the bottom springy grass to return to the hill with three. Again, use the left one, and at the next hill, use the top one by the tree. At the next fork, go up to reach the third Shaymin!

We can actually surf here - climb the waterfall to reach an *EV Booster* and a *Max Revive*. Anyways, use the springy grass near Shaymin to reach the center again.

Next, go to the bottom right, where the hedge maze is. At the first fork, go left to reach an orb. Make your way through the rest of the maze to get the fourth Shaymin in the bottom right corner, then return to the center.

Finally, make your way to the bottom left corner, where the mushrooms are. Walk under the first two mushrooms to clear a path forward. Go to the top left, stand under the mushroom, and grab the nearby *Telluric Seed*. If you go up from this mushroom, you can reach a springy grass that will take you to:

**ZCell 44: Idyll of Pestilence**

!img("zcell_44.jpg")

Return to the mushroom area. Follow the left edge of this area down, then go right, using three mushrooms along the way. Talk to the orb at the end here, then return to the center. Walk under the mushroom in the bottom right to reach the fifth Shaymin! Return to the top of the hill in the center.

Talk to Eve once, then again for a battle.

Eve will be your ally. The opponents team largely relies on hazard damage, corrosion damage, and switching your Pokémon out with things like Whirlwind and Red Cards. Sticky Hold and Suction Cups can help alleviate these issues, as can Rapid Spin and Defog. Shaymin will also frequently transform the field to Grassy Terrain, so keep that in mind.

Once you win, the Shaymin will purify the area! This area is slightly different but has the same layout as the wasteland version.

Our first destination is the hedge maze. Follow the path up, escape the maze, and go around. Activate the orb at the end. Make your way back around and go through the now-open hedge path. Activate the next orb and repeat a few times. You'll reach the first of four *Gracidea* in the bottom right!

Next, head to the mushroom area in the bottom left. Activate the red mushroom, then leave this area. Head to the top left corner next, with all the springy grass. You'll see a mushroom near the entrance glowing red. Following the path, use the bottom of two grasses at all three of the first forks. At the choice of three grasses, use the one on the left, then the top right in the next choice. Finally, choose the top grass to reach the second *Gracidea*. Climb back up this waterfall to get the *Soul Dew*!

Make your way back to the mushroom area in the bottom left corner. Proceed through the path till you reach a purple mushroom. Step under it, then take the bottom springy grass to escape this area for now.

Make your way to the top right corner once more. Hop to the left to get a *Full Restore*. Hop your way down and right to get:

**ZCell 45: Idyll of Panaceance**

!img("zcell_45.jpg")

Hop to the island in the top right corner. Talk to the orb then use the springy grass to reach the third *Gracidea*.

Finally, return to the mushrooms in the bottom left corner. Follow the path through activating the purple mushroom as before, but take the top springy grass this time. Use the blue mushroom, then go down. Activate mushrooms as you go, making sure to go left once you use the red mushroom. Talk to the orb at the end of the path.

Use the blue mushroom down and left from here, then follow the opened path. Use a red mushroom once more, then the blue mushroom in the bottom right corner. Grab the final *Gracidea*!

Return to the center. Craudberry will show up... and we have a bit of an interesting battle-based quest to take care of!

    - Giga Drain

Winning this battle isn't hard. However, the catch here is that we actually need to end the battle with the Flower Garden Field at Stage 5... and Craudberry does everything in her power to ruin this mission.

To win, you'll have to keep a few things in mind. First, that her Heat Waves on Heatmor, Torkoal, and Crobat will turn the field into Burning Field when it is not raining, but Rain plus Torkoal's Drought will turn the field to Rainbow. Next, Acid Downpour will reset the field to Stage 1, so you'll need to either knock out Amoonguss in one turn or worry about building up the field after the Z-Move is used. It's Grassy Terrain is also annoying, since it will also reset your progress. Finally, Cut and X-Scissor cut the field down a stage for each use, so you probably want to make sure Victreebel and Qwilfish don't use it much. To actually boost the stage of the field, the easiest way is just using Synthetic Seeds on your party, but moves like Growth, Rototiller, and Water Sport are viable too.

Talk to the nearby **Shaymin** once you're done to take it with you! To the right is a *Gracidea* that you can keep. Return to the Nightclub once you're done!

## Anomalies at Subseven Sanctum

Accept Danielle's quest. Make your way to the Subseven Sanctum and enter the room on the left side of the maze. Talk to Luna then enter the door.

Defeat the acolytes. You'll wake up in a cage - you can talk to the Arceus statue to walk through walls for a finite number of tiles. The 'A' key brings you back to the last statue you have used, if you get stuck.

Start by using this statue and going straight up. Talk to the Blue Statue to the left, then return to your cell. Talk to Lukah in his, then go up the stairs yourself.

In this hallway, go up and left to enter the room with the New World Door we were previously in. If you talk to any of the statues on the left side, you can walk through the wall to reach the Red Statue. Return to the previous room.

This main room is a bit of a huge maze, so here's a screenshot if it helps you navigate it. Note that you can get up to two 'extra steps' by talking to the statue from above, in certain situations, so if it seems like it's impossible to reach the next area, try doing that. Activate the Purple Statue next.

!img("subseven_path_1.jpg")

Undo your steps to return to the entrance of the room. The next path you have to take will lead you to the Green Statue. Note that if you mess up and end up in some of the rooms on the left side, you'll have to go back to the beginning and start again.

!img("subseven_path_2.jpg")

Return to the entrance area once more. Finally, we simply have to make it to the top of this room and climb the stairs. The path:

!img("subseven_path_3.jpg")

Use the Light Shard if necessary and talk to the space deity in the room for a battle.

A lot of Ground weaknesses here, so taking advantage of the fact that your allies won't be hurt by Earthquake on this field might be the key. Note that Magearna gets stronger for every knockout, so targeting it first may be helpful. Trick Room is also great for this one.

Afterwards, you can catch **Palkia**!

With that taken care of, the maze below will now be fixed. Head into the door on the right side and use the Light Shard. Time to battle the time deity next.

Another Holy Field doubles battle. A fast Bug type or two can solve the problem of the leads. The rest of the team is pretty diverse but I'm sure you can find a way to take advantage of their weaknesses.

Catch **Dialga** once you win!

If you beat Solaris at Pyrous and are on Reshiram Route, you'll get a battle here:

Well, the field will instantly change to Grassy Terrain, then likely to Burning Field thanks to Heat Wave and Eruption. Rock, Water, and Ground moves make this simple once you can take out Tapu Bulu.

- If you beat Solaris at Pyrous and are on Reshiram Route, finish the sanctum quest (+2 Luna)

Anyways, return to the Nightclub!

While you're here, if you're on Reshiram Route, Taka will ask you to see his Chatot. We got this back in Victory Road.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Show Taka his Chatot in Reshiram Route (+2 Taka)

## Endgame

This next one has some hard fights, so prep your team accordingly.

Accept the final quest at the Nightclub then fly over to Agate City. Head down to Route 1, climb the rocks to reach Iolia Valley, then climb the waterfall at the top of the area to reach a cave. Use the Purple Crystal to enter a New World Door.

    - Destiny Bond
    - Gunk Shot

Another fight with PULSE Hypno, this time with the support of a full team on the Chess Board. I recommend Quick Guard for this fight - you'll be able to block First Impression, all of the King Rhyperior's moves, and Sucker Punch. You'll also be at the mercy of Hypno's Dark Void, so Safeguard, Chesto Berries, Sleep Talk, etc. can all be useful in keeping your momentum here. If you don't already have a Z-Move planned out, the Buginium-Z can be crucial to taking out Hypno. Bring your own King for some priority shenanigans if needed.

Start by following the path around to the left, and grab the hidden *Pretty Wing*. Proceed and you'll see... oh god.

**Master Mime. Field: Glitch Field**
- PULSE Abra, Lv. 130, @Leftovers, Ability: Magic Guard, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 4/0/0/252/0/252
    - Prismatic Laser
    - Frenzy Plant
    - Metronome

    - Hydro Cannon
- PULSE Magnezone, Lv. 130, @Leftovers, Ability: Levitate, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/0/252/0/4
    - Parabolic Charge
    - Core Enforcer
    - Bolt Strike
    - Recover
- PULSE Mr. Mime, Lv. 130, @Life Orb, Ability: Wonder Guard, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/4/0/252/0
    - Psycho Boost
- PULSE Muk, Lv. 130, @Assault Vest, Ability: Protean, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/0/0/252/4
    - Giga Drain
    - Shadow Sneak
    - Fire Blast
    - Explosion

Five PULSEs in one battle, on a field that makes this fight very interesting. First out is PULSE Abra, with three special moves that trade massive power for a recharge turn, and Metronome. While the latter isn't really an issue, this field makes it so recharge moves don't waste a turn whenever they secure knockouts, meaning whenever the powerful Abra can one shot you, it doesn't ever recharge. Clawitzer works basically the same as before, though it has Hydro Cannon to achieve the same effect as Abra. Magnezone has Bolt Strike for damage, Core Enforcer for coverage, and Parabolic Charge and Recover for healing, on top of Levitate, meaning it is hard to take down. PULSE Muk is mostly a special set with Protean Giga Drain and Fire Blast, but can use priority Shadow Sneak as well as Explosion, which acts basically as a nuke on this field. Finally there is PULSE Mr. Mime, who has only Psycho Boost. The 1 base SpA and Psycho Boost SpA drops gets ignored in favor of Mime's 190 SpD, so it can fire off this move over and over. Note that it's Wonder Guard plus the fact that Fairy moves are turned into Normal on this field means... you can't even damage it under normal means.

So, it's all pretty intense, but doable. One thing to try is just changing the field outright - with the four Tapus, various weather conditions, pledge moves, etc. you can quash the team's strategies. Trick Room is additionally good here as well, only Muk is somewhat slow. If you do play on the field, I recommend some combination of the following: a Dark type with a lot of SpD to deal with Abra, such as Umbreon, for the immunity to its strongest move: Prismatic Laser. If it can then survive Frenzy Plant and Blast Burn, you can then take advantage of its recharge turn. A fast Pokémon with Smack Down, another with a physical Ground move to take care of Magnezone. Mirror Coat, Gastro Acid, Topsy-Turvy, Haze, etc. are all good moves to counter Clawitzer's strategy if you're having trouble, or you can use the Dragonium-Z to nuke it. A Dark type with Toxic is my recommended strategy to deal with Mime since it can't touch a Dark type, bonus points if you have a set up move to help deal with the rest of the team. Anything with decent SpD can probably handle Muk; bonus points if you can bait it's Explosion and Protect or something like that.

Once you win, you'll get the first *Nanab Berry*!

Back in the center, you'll find Anna, who can heal your team. Anyways, proceed to the right side next. Grab the hidden *Health Wing* then go down for another fight.

**PULSE Camerupt. Field: New World**
- PULSE Camerupt, Lv. 130, @Lum Berry, Ability: Sturdy, Modest Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Eruption
    - Shadow Ball
    - Earth Power
    - Snarl
- Whimsicott, Lv. 130, @Leftovers, Ability: Prankster, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/4/0/0/252
    - Safeguard
    - Protect
    - Moonblast
    - Hurricane
- Meowstic-Male, Lv. 130, @Leftovers, Ability: Prankster, Modest Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/4/0/252/0
    - Safeguard
    - Protect
    - Psychic
    - Dark Pulse
- Klefki, Lv. 130, @Leftovers, Ability: Prankster, Bold Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/252/4/0/0
    - Foul Play
    - Safeguard
    - Protect
    - Dazzling Gleam
- Amoonguss, Lv. 130, @Black Sludge, Ability: Effect Spore, Bold Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/252/0/4/0
    - Spore
    - Strength Sap
    - Rage Powder
    - Sludge Bomb

The PULSE we never actually got to fight is here at last... and it's about as annoying as you'd expect. Basically, it has Shedinja's 1 HP gimmick on top of Sturdy, meaning it just shrugs off every attack! On top of its Lum Berry and the rest of the team having Safeguard and Rage Powder, the team makes every attempt to prevent you from simply poisoning it. The New World field prevents weather chip damage as well. With field-boosted Earth Power and always max power Eruption, it hits hard too, so trying to stall out its PP may result in your team dead. The rest of the team is a solid Double's support team.

How DO you beat it, then? Camerupt's ONLY good stat is SpA, so if you get up Light Screen and get out some Pokémon with good SpD, you might be able to just eat its attacks and focus on the rest of the team, all of which aren't really dedicated attackers. Eventually you can use Toxic on it once the support is dead! "Easy mode" is just to send out a Pokémon with Mold Breaker, Gastro Acid, Worry Seed, etc., since Camerupt can then be literally knocked out with Lick or any other non Normal/Fighting type attacking move once it loses its ability. Then the rest of the fight is fairly simple.

Get the second *Nanab Berry* for winning.

Back in the center, head up. On a small path to the right is a hidden *Swift Wing*. Past ??? is a hidden *Muscle Wing*. Up from here is a hidden *Resist Wing*, and a *Genius Wing* and *Clever Wing* are to the left.

**PULSE Tangrowth. Field: Swamp Field**
- PULSE Tangrowth C, Lv. 130, @Amplifield Rock, Ability: Filter, Relaxed Nature, EVs: 252/0/252/0/4/0
    - Trick Room
    - Poison Gas
    - Sludge Wave

    - Trick Room
    - Sleep Powder
    - Petal Blizzard
    - Mud Bomb
- PULSE Swalot, Lv. 130, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Water Absorb, Sassy Nature, EVs: 252/0/4/252/0/0
    - Clear Smog

    - Giga Drain
    - Nasty Plot

    - Strength Sap
    - Rock Slide

We already fought the "absurdly strong PULSEs who are good on Glitch Field" so now it's time for the "absurdly tanky PULSEs who are good on the Swamp Field". As you can probably tell, these PULSEs are dedicated to bulk, healing, and gradually wearing you down. They also use Trick Room to take advantage of their generally low speed. On top of this, their Poison and Mud-based Water and Ground moves are all powered up here.

As in the other fight, you can use the various generated fields we've collected by now if you want to take some of the wind out of their strategy. You can also stick it out on the Swamp Field if you want. One thing to try would be to set up your own tanks - Steel and Poison types can use the Telluric Seed to great effect here, for example. Sludge Wave and Gunk Shot get a 2.25x boost on this field, so you can try to set up and use that move to overwhelm your opponents - only Swalot resists Poison. Sleep Powder has perfect accuracy on this field - so I recommend using this move liberally to prevent Trick Room, allow your partner to set up, etc. You can also use Toxic on half of the team, or consider something like the Ghost type version of Curse to rapidly drain HP.

Win to nab the third *Nanab Berry*, then return to the ??? guy. Up and to the right, you'll be able to follow a new path. Hug the bottom wall to reach:

Oh. Your team is all set to Lv. 1 and you can't use bag items. Oh no.

Unlike Solaris at Pyrous, this battle truly is intended to be lost, and there is no reward other than a few lines of dialogue for winning. That said, the only way you really can win is via strategies like FEAR... but it is technically doable if you feel like it.

With all that taken care of, you'll receive Darkrai! Return to the Nightclub.

A pretty annoying team that relies on, well, putting you to sleep constantly. Every single one is weak to Fairy moves, however, so a couple speedy Dazzling Gleam users trivialize this fight.

Once you win, you'll be able to catch **Darkrai**, for real this time. I mean it. Return to the Nightclub!
