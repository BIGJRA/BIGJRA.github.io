# Postgame Episode 2: Fetch, Doggy!

Time for some more legendary quests. Note that your level cap has silently gone up to Lv. 110. Note that within each section, these quests can be done in any order, so feel free to bounce around if you'd like.

## Fetching the Legendary Birds

Talk to Cass behind the counter once more. She'll tell us about three birds that we have to find in thematically-relevant locations. Hmm...

Fly over to Ametrine City, then climb the mountain. Where we once fought Blake, you can fight and catch **Articuno**.

Fly over to Beryl Ward, and go across the bridge to the east. In the factory where Shade once was, we can catch **Zapdos**.

Finally, fly over to Apophyll Academy, and climb Pyrous Mountain. At the top of the volcano is **Moltres**.

As of Gen VII, 9.6% of all Pokemon were legendaries... too many, perhaps, GF? Anyways, that's why not every quest could realistically be a huge affair. Don't worry if these three bored you though, many fantastic quests are still to come.

Return to the Nightclub. If you want, get Articuno out of the PC and talk to Lumi a few times.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Show Lumi your Articuno (+1 Lumi)

## Fetching the Lake Spirits

Back in the Nightclub, talk to Seacrest. He will tell us that the Lake Spirits, fittingly, are abround the lake.

Fly to Coral Ward, then go west. Head left at the fork, then follow the rocks along the bottom left and down until you reach a sandbank. Go right, dive down, go up, then surface. You'll find **Azelf** chilling at the top.

From here, retrace your steps until you reach the sandbar. From here, go straight up and hug the left wall until you reach another sandbar, then go left. Dive down here, go up, surface, go up and left, cross the sand, and dive down once more. You'll find **Uxie** in the top right corner.

Surface, and fly to Apophyll Academy. From here, follow the path up towards the Apophyll Cave, surfing up and following the small path right towards the dive spot. Dive down. A bit down and right from the top left corner is a small 2x2 spot to surface - do so here. Enter Apophyll Cave. You'll need to freeze the water here in a battle by using Blizzard or Subzero Slammer. Enter the cave up and to the left to find **Mesprit**!

## Route 1 New World

Head back to the Nightclub. Talk to Randall this time and get the quest to visit Route 1 next.

Fly over to the Route 1 Nature Center, and talk to Sandy outside. We are looking for three anomalies. The first is actually on the roof of this building, so climb the stairs inside and enter.

**New World (Route 1 West)**

Another Trick Room oriented New World team. This time Aromatisse has a Sash, so OHKO'ing it is not an option. Thankfully, it is the only Trick Room user, meaning once the Trick Room wears off, you're good to go. Ursaring, Primarina, and especially Mega Camerupt are extremely strong under the Trick Room, so stalling it out may be ideal. Entei is last and is actually fast, so watch out for that. You can wall it out with a bulky Rock/Ground type entirely, so defeating it shouldn't be too bad.

You can catch **Entei** afterwards. I also just realized that the realm containing Entei has only wild Unown. Sick reference!

Return to Route 1, and take a Tauros to the east. If you haven't solved the Aventurine Woods puzzles... you'll have to now. Anyways, use a Tauros to follow the long path in South Aventurine Woods to the southeast, where you'll find a New World Door.

**New World (Route 1 South)**

Surf up. While you're going up, hug the right wall. You'll get a *Max Revive* and find:

**ZCell 01: New World (Route 2 South)**

Head left and up for another Anomaly battle.

**Anomaly Suicune. Field: Water Surface**

    - Ice Beam
    - Calm Mind
    - Hidden Power

Don't worry: not all Anomalies will be on New World. Not that that makes this fight any better. All six Pokemon have Elemental Seeds, granting SpD and Aqua Ring. The team is particularly bulky, sporting all kinds of Def/SpD boosting moves, healing moves, Toxic, etc. Goodra serves as a blocker to Electric and Grass moves, too. If you are able to turn the field to Murkwater, they can't change it back, meaning all their Elemental Seeds will now Poison them, making their stall strategies much less effective. You can also use a set-up sweeper of some kind that uses Water type's weaknesses, as long as you have a strategy for Ludicolo and Goodra.

Once you win, you'll be able to battle and catch **Suicune**.

Back on Route 1, towards the east side of the Route, grab a Tauros and enter the second-to-last entrance to North Aventurine Woods. There's a ledge right and up you can climb to reach a New World Door.

**New World (Route 1 North)**

Rotom will usually use its Z-Move to transform the field to Snowy Mountain. You can dampen the team's strategies somewhat by preventing this from happening by OHKO'ing Rotom, if you want. These two field effects are pretty stacked, damage-wise, so read up on the Field Manual if you're stuck on it. Trick Room can also help out here, preventing Sandslash and Raikou from going on killing streaks.

Once you win, you can battle and catch **Raikou**.

Return to the Nightclub once you're done.

## Route 2 New World

Back in the Nightclub, talk to Zero and accept his quest. Fly over to the Celestinine Cascade and go right onto Route 2. If the leftmost Crustle is still in the way, climb some nearby rocks to get some Red Powder, then remove the Crustle. Enter this cave and the New World Door.

Talk to Amaria inside to the right. You'll need to find someone who can read Braille to help.

Fly over to Coral Ward, and enter the apartment on the upper side. Talk to Danielle inside, who will sass you then meet you in the Route 2 New World.

Talk to her... and we'll have to play Simon Says. Follow the instructions that Simon says precisely, and a new door will open. Follow it.

    - Toxic
    - Rest

This team generally relies upon Stakataka's Trick Room, which can easily be shut down by OHKO'ing it. The move Earth Power can easily do the trick. Regirock and Regice eat up Physical and Special moves, holding a Band and Specs, respectively. Registeel gets an Omniboost and will try to stall you out with Toxic and Seismic Toss. The Tyranitar is a special set, benefitting from the field effect with most of its moves, and Mega Mawile rounds out the team with very strong Sucker Punch, potentially boosted by Power-Up-Punch. If you can take out the Trick Room, set up a Sweeper (ideally with a Fighting type move), and have a plan to deal with Sucker Punch, you're golden.

With that out of the way, we'll be free to explore from here in three directions. I start by going left. Talk to the braille tablet here, then to Danielle when you're ready. Time for more Simon Says. Note that you will have to move yourself to move the boulders as instructed - this is ok and won't ruin your attempt. Enter the opened door, where you can find and catch **Regirock**.

Back out in the main room, go up at the fork. Talk to the Braille, then Danielle to get instructions. Here, we'll have to do 5 slides across the ice to break all five tiles, but never stepping over one incorrectly. We need to slide: Left, Right, Left, Up, Right. The key here is that you can slide on the other spots of ice just as long as you don't hit the same spot twice. With the ice spots numbered 1-5, top to bottom:

- Go left to break 2
- Go right to break 3
- Go left to break 1, then go up, right, down to sneak your way back to the right side of the ice
- Go up to break 4, then go right, down, left across the ice, down across the ice.
- From here, go right to break 5.

Head in to catch **Regice**.

Make your way to the right side of the main room now, talk to the Braille once more. Danielle will make us play Danielle Says this time. Ignore her when Simon says, but listen when Danielle says. Once you succeed, head through the door to catch **Registeel**!

Make your way out of the New World.
