# Postgame Episode 8: A Canvas of Cyclical Conflict

Word. Level cap up to Lv. 145.

## Citae Prisma

Accept Randall's quest, then fly over to Beryl. Enter Beryl Cave and make your way through until you reach the New World Door. Head on in.

Talk to Serra above. There are some encounters here in the water - notably, one of the strongest Ultra Beasts.

!enc(896)
Head up and talk to Luna and Elias. Talking to them will make the room dark or light, respectively. Study the puzzle in the light, then turn it dark to complete it.

Essentially, we will want to make a beam in the center of the room hit one of the four crystals in the corners. Our first goal will be hitting the Blue Crystal. Start by moving the mirror up to hit it:

!img("citae_prisma_1.jpg")

Use the crystal, cross the bridge above, and talk to the orb.

You'll notice that there are now two mirrors. Move them in the light, switch it in the dark, then move them again in the darkness. You'll see outlines of the mirrors left over, and using the activated Purple Crystal will move all mirrors from their current locations to their previous locations. Keep this in mind as we solve the future puzzles.

Our next goal will be hitting Green, but to do so, we need to make use of the Purple Crystal. Position the crystals in the light, then move them like so:

!img("citae_prisma_2.jpg")

This should light up the purple crystal - don't activate it yet though. Using the Purple Crystal will reset the mirrors to the positions of their shadows from the light, but requires timing: you'll want to move one mirror into place such that a well timed Purple Crystal activation will allow the light to reach Green. The image below shows the direction the light will travel - you must time your use of the Purple Crystal while the light is in the red zone in order to succeed. I recommend turning off speed up for these puzzles.

!img("citae_prisma_3.jpg")

Activate the Green Crystal, then smash the debris on the puzzle board. Our next mission will be to activate the Blue and Green crystals at the same time - note that using the prism in the center will reset all crystals but Purple. We now have a beam that goes left out of the prism, so that's useful. First, you'll need to place the mirrors in the light, then move them into place in the dark. First, you'll need to charge Purple like before, so set it up like this:

!img("citae_prisma_4.jpg")

Activate Purple. Next, move the mirror into place and solve like before, using Purple while BOTH lights are in their respective 'red zone':

!img("citae_prisma_5.jpg")

Activate both Blue and Green, then follow the path to the right to reach another orb. Also, just across the ice bridge, attempt to walk into the bottom right corner to find:

**ZCell 65: Citae Prisma**

!img("zcell_65.jpg")

Our next mission will be to activate Green, Red, and Blue all at the same time. Set up the mirrors in the light, activate Purple as usual, then set up the mirrors to complete the puzzle, which thankfully isn't too different from the previous. Set them up and solve:

!img("citae_prisma_6.jpg")

IMPORTANT: Before activating the crystals, move the leftmost mirror down one tile, as otherwise it will get stuck on top of a rock after activating the Red Crystal. Once you do this, activate all three crystals, then make your way to the left to reach another orb. You can also now go up from the puzzle to get:

**ZCell 66: Citae Prisma**

!img("zcell_66.jpg")

Talk to Serra in the puzzle, and you'll notice that the final mirror we get is broken. Use the light at the middle, and it will actually go through Serra towards the direction she's facing, so she's essentially a rotatable mirror. We can't teleport her anywhere using the Purple Crystal, though. Our final goal is to have all four crystals activated at once. Again, we can activate Purple beforehand, but we need to set it up so that once we use the prism in the middle, all four beams of light eventually find a respective crystal.

First, set up all the crystals and Serra into their final positions, then turn it light, and dark again.

!img("citae_prisma_7.jpg")

Using the prism will activate Purple, so do that next. From here, move the crystals into their next positions. The timing is really tight on this one, so save/reset if needed. Use the Purple Crystal as soon as the light passes both of the circled mirrors.

!img("citae_prisma_8.jpg")

You'll get confirmation from Serra once you're successful. Activate Blue again to cross the ice bridge and enter the door above. Time for an Anomaly battle once you're ready.

!battle(["Necrozma", :NECROZMA, 0], "Rainbow Field upon Crystal Cavern Field")

All six members of the confusing Solgaleo, Lunala, and Necrozma fusion bunch are here for a fight, including Ultra Necrozma in all its 754 BST glory. Not to mention some field boosts and seeds to make them even stronger! However, all six of them share the Psychic type, so sweeping with Ghost/Dark moves is the way to go.

Once you win, you can catch **Necrozma**! Exit back to the Nightclub once you're done.

## Chasing the Super High-Speed Pokémon

Accept Danielle's quest, then fly over to the Pokémon League on Charous Mountain. Head down to the large dragon statue here for a battle.

!battle(["Rayquaza", :RAYQUAZA, 0], "Snowy Mountain")

Another tough double battle with a lot of hard hitting Pokémon. I recommend Light Screen and Trick Room - combined, your Pokémon will get slower with every use of Icy Wind, allowing them to hit first. You can switch the field to Mountain if you'd like.

Once you win, Rayquaza will run off... and roam the Reborn region! It functions pretty similarly to the main series roamers - when you switch areas, Rayquaza probably will, too. And, just like the main series games, simply using your Reborn Ball on it is the easiest thing to do. I generally run around Reborn City and check the map until Rayquaza happens to be in the same ward as you, then use Repels to weed out everything else except Rayquaza, who is at Lv. 145.

Anyways, succeed and catch **Rayquaza**, then return to the Nightclub.

## Umbral Battles in Aegir Cave (Part 2)

Now that we have Rayquaza, we can go help out the OTS squad over in the Aegir Cave. Make your way there. Add Rayquaza to your party, then talk to Florinia. She'll then let you access the PC one more time before the gauntlet of sheer pain that follows.

!dbattle(["Amaria", :UMBAMARIA, 1], ["Titania", :UMBTITANIA, 1], "Cave Field")

This battle isn't that crazy - you'll notice that most of their Pokémon have moves that indiscriminately damage all Pokémon, including their allies. Bulky Pokémon, Wide Guard, etc. will help here. You'll also notice that if Kyogre and Groudon come in at the same time, the field will change to the Rainbow Field. Rock Slide gets power on the Cave Field and extra flinch chance on the Rainbow Field, so I recommend using it for this fight.

If you're on Lin Route, you get fully healed here... otherwise on Anna Route ONLY the non-fainted Pokemon get healed. Yikes!

The second battle of this gauntlet is determined by:

- Anna Route, Titania RP >= Amaria RP: Fight Amaria
- Anna Route, Titania RP < Amaria RP: Fight Titania
- Lin Route, Titania RP > Amaria RP: Fight Titania
- Lin Route, Titania RP <= Amaria RP: Fight Amaria

Battle whichever gym leader plus anomaly:

!dbattle(["Amaria", :UMBAMARIA, 2], ["Kyogre", :KYOGRE, 0], "Water Surface")

This fight is absolute suffering. Even if you get your team fully healed... it's still a 12v6 against a Water Surface team. Your fast grounded Pokémon will get easily outsped, Surf will roll you over, your weather will be overwritten with Heavy Rain... etc. Even if you use Trick Room, there are a few slower opponents poised to take advantage of it like Toxapex. There are a few things we can try to take advantage of: Murkwater Field, Underwater, and Icy Field can all be potentially better to fight on than Water Surface, so changing the field is often smart. One other important thing to note is that Mega Swampert and Black Kyurem are the *only* Pokemon with physical attacking moves, meaning a Special Defense tank or two is going to be particularly well suited to this fight, especially with a Water resistance.

!dbattle(["Titania", :UMBTITANIA, 2], ["Groudon", :GROUDON, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Thankfully I generally think this fight is much nicer than the Amaria fight, but it is still a very tough 12v6. There are a lot of Fire types here, so a sweeper with Ground and Rock moves might be good here. You can transform the Grassy Terrain into Corrosive Field potentially if that will help you. Burning Field activates Elemental Seeds and boosts their many Fire type moves, so it might not be the best choice. I will shoutout Mega Tyranitar for this fight, who basically turns off the strategy of the lead Ninetales and Venusaur, allowing a Dragon Dance sweep.

Once you win, you can catch **Kyogre**/**Groudon**, who holds the *Blue Orb*/*Red Orb*!

Head into the New World via surfing up the waterfalls, where you'll be able to find and catch **Groudon**/**Kyogre**, who holds the *Red Orb*/*Blue Orb*!

Head back down into Aegir Cave to talk to the group, then return to the Nightclub!

## The Mysterious Battle Pavilion Challenger

Accept the Ringmaster's quest next. We'll actually need to win a few Battle Tower-style battles in the Battle Pavilion on the left side of the Nightclub to proceed, so prepare your best team of 3. You can't use Megas or Z-Moves, nor the strong legendaries... so keep that in mind.

Once you beat 4 trainers, you'll face off against this one:

!battle(["Mewtwo", :DEFNOT, 1000], "Rainbow Field")

You do have to fight one of the strongest Mega Evolutions without being able to use the same feature, but I think you can find a team that will be able to manage. 4 randomized fights beforehand shouldn't be too terrible, I hope.

Well, our challenger flies away after we win.

## Neoteric Isle

Head over to talk to the Ringmaster once more. Head over to Tanzan Mountain, make your way all the way down to the New World Door beneath the Steelix tunnel room, then head in.

!enc(511)

Our final Ultra Beast is located here! Anyways, at the first fork, head down and surf to reach the *N-Lunarizer* as well as:

**ZCell 67: Neoteric Isle**

!img("zcell_67.jpg")

Continuing on the path, you'll see another:

**ZCell 68: Neoteric Isle**

!img("zcell_68.jpg")

There is one more outside - follow the path to the left of the first tall tower to reach:

**ZCell 69: Neoteric Isle**

!img("zcell_69.jpg")

Head back to the first tall tower and enter. Prepare yourself however you can and attempt to enter the door at the top: you'll have to fight **Alter Clone**, a trainer that copies your team and makes them PULSE 2!

An interesting gimmick fight - you have to fight your team, but with PULSE 2. So, your sweepers will be bulkier than usual and your tanks will have more offensive power. One obvious answer to this fight is Trick Room - all of your alter will have 252 in Speed, but you don't have to. Then you can try to get a set up sweep going. There are also ways to cheese this fight with one Pokémon if you're really stuck.

Enter this room. On the left wall you'll see one tile that doesn't look right - walk into it to reach another door. Inside, you can get:

**ZCell 70: Neoteric Isle**

!img("zcell_70.jpg")

Head up and talk to Fern, then enter the door to the right. You'll find the *N-Solarizer* as well as:

**ZCell 71: Neoteric Isle**

!img("zcell_71.jpg")

Back at the fork, go up for one heck of a battle.

!dbattle(["Mewtwo", :MEWTWO, 1], ["Mew", :MEW, 0], "Holy Field")

This fight is rough: it's a 12v6 on the Holy Field, with the potential for Mew's Z-move transforming the field into Psychic Terrain. They have a good mix of super powerful single target moves and field-supported spread moves that make it hard to capitalize too much with standard doubles strategies. Terrakion is a bit weird in that it doesn't have many Attack EV's, so you may be able to one shot Tyranitar with a Fighting move and set up with your other Pokémon on Turn 1. The leads are weak to Ground too, so you can take advantage of the field protecting your teammates and use Earthquake. Field boosted Dazzling Gleam is particularly potent here - only Groudon and Magearna resist it. The team is also quite weak to Psychic moves overall, so you may be able to use Psychic Terrain and/or run with Mew's Z-move to try to sweep on that field. In general, Extremespeed is also extremely potent here and will hit Lunala and Necrozma super-effectively, though hazards are recommended to circumvent Shadow Shield.

Once you regain control, talk to **Mew** and **Mewtwo** for a chance to catch each. Nothing we can do to help out our friend here for now, so return to the Nightclub.

## Twilight Desert (Part 2)

With all 71 Zygarde Cells collected, it's a great time to head on back to the Twilight Desert! Talk to Marcello in the Nightclub and then enter the New World Door in the Tourmaline Desert to the right of the train platform.

First, if you'd like to, talk to the machine in one of the side rooms to exchange your Zygarde Cells for more Cell Imprints, and exchange some for Negative Imprints if you'd like.

Head into the main building and talk to Terra here. If you have collected least 50 cells, the path will be opened here, Terra will give you two *Beast Balls*, and a decent reward will be available later. If not, Terra will ask you if you want to go collect the rest. If not, you'll instead have to fight some battles:

If you have fewer than 10 Cells, you'll fight:

!battle(["5Sj", :GLITCH1, 0], "Glitch Field")

Then, if you have fewer than 20 Cells, you'll fight:

!battle(["HHHHH", :GLITCH2, 0], "Glitch Field")

Then, if you have fewer than 30 Cells, you'll fight:

!battle(["404", :GLITCH3, 0], "Glitch Field")

If you have fewer than 40 Cells, you'll fight:

!battle(["0x5656", :GLITCH4, 0], "Glitch Field")

Finally, for having fewer than 50 Cells, you'll fight:

!battle(["MRMR2", :GLITCH4, 0], "Glitch Field")

Either by fighting or by simply walking, proceed up from here. If you had at least 50 cells before, you'll need to enhance your Zygarde at this machine, to create **Zygarde 50%**. Otherwise, you'll simply need to create a Zygarde 10% via the other machine, so you'll still need a minimum of 10 cells. Once you have the desired Zygarde Form, show it to Terra.

Hilariously, on Lin Route, you can just... opt out of fighting Anomaly Zygarde here. If you are on Anna Route or opt in:

!battle(["Zygarde", :ZYGARDE, 0], "Glitch Field")

Glitch Field team that maximizes the shenanigans of the field. Set up a physical sweeper on Toxapex or something to win this one.

Once you win, or if you skipped the fight, you'll get **Zygarde 100%**. Neat.

Before we leave, Walk to the right onto the green tile, then go left down the path. Solve the puzzle at this monitor. When finished, it will look like:

!img("zygarde.jpg")

As for actually solving it, you'll notice that you are essentially dragging rows and columns. This is actually very similar to solving the magic square puzzle once you know where everything goes - if we're solving top to bottom, left to right, simply drag the column down so that the target space is in line with the target piece, move the row containing it over so it fits, then move the column back into place. If you could figure out that other puzzle, this one won't be too bad.

Head back to the right to pick up the *DNA Splicers*. Anyways, return to Reborn City.

## Rhodochrine Tree (Part 2)

With 100% Zygarde in your party, talk to Shelly in the Underroot. If you had gotten at least 50 Cells in the previous quest, you'll now get Elias' 6IV Ditto. Helpful for some late game breeding.

Talk to Heather at the base of the tree and accept her offer for a lift to the top. The barriers will be gone now, so we can explore the top. Going up and left, then crossing under a waterfall, you can find the *Diancite*.

Continuing along this path, you'll see Anomaly Xerneas. Talk to it when you're ready.

!dbattle(["Xerneas", :XERNEAS, 0], ["Noel", :UMBNOEL, 0], "Psychic Terrain")

This fight is wild... not the least because they decided to make the literally useless Cosmoem into an actually contributing Pokémon! The team essentially works via the Psych Up boost for Psychic Terrain - if Cosmoem is allowed to live, Noel will copy the defenses, double his Pokémon's SpA, and go H.A.M. If you want to avoid this, taking out or using Taunt on Cosmoem is a good idea. Your own Pokémon (potentially, with Psych Up) can then do a counter-sweep by cleaning up the right side first!

Once you win, Noel will give you **Xerneas**!

Make your way to the bottom right corner of the area for another fight.

!battle(["Yveltal", :YVELTAL, 0], "Starlight Arena")

Boosted Dark moves are pretty incredible here - pair a sweeper with something to deal with Xerneas and Yveltal, and you should be ok. Yveltal in particular is annoying thanks to its Dark Aura field boosted Sucker Punches, so keep that in mind.

Once you win, you can catch **Yveltal**.

Talk to Noel towards the top, then attempt to exit once you're ready for one more fight.

!battle(["Eclipse", :UMBECLIPSE, 0], "Rainbow Field")

The Magical Seeds grant a wish as well as a defense boost to the holder, so a lot of these Pokémon will be a pain to take out... unless you can knock them all out in one shot. A special sweeper, especially with Rainbow Field boosted moves, will be likely to succeed if you can set them up right.

Once you win, accept the fast travel request to return to the Nightclub. Now that we have rescued Eclipse, fly over to Calcenon City and enter her father's house. After a scene inside, Eclipse will give you the *Mewtwonite X* and the *Mewtwonite Y*! You can also talk to the father to get the password: *shinycharm*. Nice.

## Bee's Pokédex Completion Quest (Part 3)

Oh, and there's one more thing we can do. Head over to talk to Bee in Agate City.

We'll learn that she wants to see all of the Ultra Beasts. If you've gotten Nihilego, Buzzwole, Pheromosa, Xurkitree, Celesteela, Kartana, Guzzlord, Poipole, Naganadel, Stakataka, and Blacephalon, talk to her to get the *Ultranecrozium-Z*!

She'll tell us what she wants to see next - full Pokédex completion. If you've been keeping up with the guide so far, we'll already be 806/807 of the way there... so we'll return soon, don't worry.
