# Episode 17: Rust Thicker Than Water

Before we leave the gym, head to the top of the room. You'll find a hidden *Heart Scale* up here. Heal up if you need to - if you've progressed the quest up to this point, you can also talk to the left side of the flowery 'X' to find Corin Rouge! Battle him.

Return to the north side of Peridot Ward and talk to the Corin Rouge lookalike here. He will jump on a train to escape! Darn.

Head into Jasper Ward now to talk to the Police Chief, who will give you *Safety Goggles*. This massive quest quest will be over soon, I swear.

Head down to the Lower Peridot Ward. If we previously did the Onix quest and got the Hiker moved into a new house, we'll find him southeast of the Pokémon Center, and he'll give us a *Choice Band* if we joined the Aqua Gang, and a *Choice Specs* if we joined the Magma Gang. Sweet!

## Reborn Restoration Project 1

Anyways, head over to the Grand Hall. One of the guys behind the desk will be accepting donations for one of three projects.

We can only choose to fund one right now, then each of the other two as soon as we get the fifteenth and sixteenth gym badges respectively. You won't be missing out on anything in the long term depending on your choice here. If you want to make a more informed choice, read the following three subsections to see what the rewards are for each.

As soon as you fully fund a project, you will be able to access the Grand Hall basement, so head down there. The bottom room on the right contains an *Adamant Mint*, a *Modest Mint*, and 3 *Exp. Candy XL*. Next door you'll find 2 *EV Boosters*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria in the Grand Hall basement (+1 Victoria)

If you enter the room at the very top and talk to the computer, you can get a *Lopunnite* and unleash Vulpix. Do it even if you don't like Mega Lopunny, trust me. There is one more quest we can start in the basement but I will cover it a bit later.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #1 (+1 Adrienn)

Anyways, the three options:

- [Affordable Living in Obsidia](#affordable-living-in-obsidia-project) ($60000)
- [Railnet Reconstruction](#railnet-reconstruction-project) ($100000)
- [Azurine Nature Center](#azurine-nature-center-project) ($80000)

### Affordable Living in Obsidia Project

Donate the $60000 to fund this project. Head down to the South Obsidia Ward once you complete it, you'll notice that the whole area has been revamped and the Slums are no more.

You'll be able to find Berries growing at the bottom, namely 2 *Lansat Berries*, 2 *Apicot Berries*, 2 *Petaya Berries*, 2 *Salac Berries*, 2 *Ganlon Berries*, and 2 *Liechi Berries*.

Enter the building and talk to a guy behind the counter to get a *GUM Key*. You can also grab a *SOLICE Application* here, which we will need if we're doing the Magma Gang application quest.

Outside, talk to the girl up and to the right of the SOLICE office and agree to help with her quest.

Fly over to Jasper and enter the Malchous Forest Park. Talk to Sandy when you're ready.

Thanks to Lv. 100 Farfetch'd, lots of Forest Field boosted Cuts, and Sandy's team being weak to a lot of their moves and Rain making it harder to burn the forest down, this team might come as more of a challenge than you might expect, but some good physically defensive Pokémon will be helpful here.

These things are tough but a powerful Ground type sweeper can probably do the trick. Once you win, Sandy will leave.

- Help Sandy in the WTC (-1 Adrienn)

While we're down here, we can use the GUM Key that we got earlier. In the upper-right hand side of the Central Obsidia Water Grid you'll notice a locked door which we can now open. There is a puzzle beyond.

Essentially, we will need to move green sections of pipe into place so that they will complete the entire pipe circuit such that we end up in the upper right hand corner. This is a fun one to solve yourself, in my opinion, but here is a solution:

- In the bottom left corner, move the vertical pipe to the right one tile, into place.
- Head down from here and move the horizontal pipe up two tiles, into place.
- Head all the way to the right side, as far right as you can go without moving more pipes. Up from here, push a horizontal pipe up two, out of its place for now.
- Grab *TM84 Poison Jab* here.
- From here go straight down. Push the rightmost horizontal pipe down two spaces, again out of its final place for now.
- Down from here, the left of the two vertical pipes can be pushed left two spaces, into place.
- The pipe to the right, the other vertical pipe, can be pushed two spaces left as well, into place.
- Up and slightly left from here you'll see a column of horizontal pipes. You can safely push the bottom-most one down four spaces, into place.
- Go up and push the second-from-the-bottom horizontal pipe down four tiles, into place.
- From here, up and left a few tiles is a vertical pipe. Pushing it four tiles would put it in place - push it six to the left for now to keep the corridor open.
- For each of the next three horizontal pipes in the column, push them down two tiles each, into their respective places.
- Next, make your way to the top-left side of the room. You'll notice two vertical pipes in a row at the top of the room, and below the right of the pair is another vertical pipe. Push this one left six times, into place.
- Down from here is a horizontal pipe you can push three tiles down, into place.
- The vertical pipe currently against the left wall is the first in a long row of vertical pipes. You can now safely push the second vertical pipe in this row left 8 times, into place.
- Down and right from here you'll find a horizontal pipe that can be pushed down four times, into place.
- Go straight up, and push the two vertical pipes along the top wall right four tiles respectively, into place for both.
- You can now safely push the third in the long row of vertical pipes left six spaces, into place.
- Go right and down. You'll see a horizontal pipe that you can push down four spaces into place.
- Down from here you can push another horizontal pipe up two spaces, into place.
- Go up from here to return to the right side of the area. Up from the long column you'll find a U shaped alcove. Push the top-left vertical pipe two tiles right, out of place for now.
- You'll now be able to push the fourth vertical pipe in the long row left four tiles, into place.
- Head down to the bottom right corner. Push the bottom right pipe up two tiles, into place.
- To escape from here, go up and left. You'll notice that we previously pushed this vertical pipe two spaces left of its place to escape, so now we can push it to the right now two spaces, into place.
- Go up and back into the U-shaped alcove. Push the third and second vertical pipes from the right in the long row left four times respectively, into place.
- Of the two horizontal pipes remaining nearby, push the bottom one two times, into place.
- Push the final horizontal pipe down twice, into place.
- Push the vertical pipe in the top left corner left twice, into place.
- To escape the alcove, push the vertical pipe on the right side right twice.
- Only two pipes remain out of place: push them down twice and left twice to finish the puzzle!

Talk to the computer in this area to get a **Goomy**!

If you push the nearby vertical pipe left two times to re-enter the U-shaped alcove, you can talk to the pipe on the wall to return to the front of the room.

With that out of the way, return to the Grand Hall basement. In the bottom right room, you'll find Sandy again. Talk to her in here... and after everything plays out, you'll get the *Waterium-Z*. Nice.

That's it for this restoration project.

### Railnet Reconstruction Project

Donate the $100000 to fund this project.

Essentially, this project funds a revamp of the Underground Railnet, so most of the things we can now get surround that. To start, head to Peridot Ward and head east into the Underground Railnet entrance under Opal Ward.

This area is the "Lost and Found". Always obtainable here are the *Assault Vest* and *Iron Plate*. If you realize that you missed out on getting any important items due to story progression such as Key Items, PULSE and Field Readouts, or TMs, check back here and they might just be here!

Next, enter the Devon Co. building and head down the stairs. The basement stairs will be blocked off, allowing us to grab the *Steelixite*!

Enter the railnet building to the left of the Pokémon Center in Obsidia. This is now the Goldenrod Station of the functioning railnet - we will be visiting each station to see what's new there. We don't lose money buying tickets, but the subway isn't really any more useful than Fly, which we already have, so this is really just for exploration.

Anyways, the Grandview Station is just the building we used to get to the desert previously, so there's nothing new there. The Ivyline Station is in the basement of the Onyx Trainer School, but we also aren't getting anything other than NPC dialogue there. Same for the Sunset Station, which is just outside in Northern Peridot Ward. Continuing the bad luck of no new content is the Heatherhill Station which brings us to the Jasper Ward Pokémon Center, and the Peony Station, which brings us to a random building in the Lapis Ward.

The Kingsbury Station though? It brings us to a random building in Beryl Ward, but an NPC inside will give us the *Weakness Policy*. Insert world's longest "yea boi" here. But the Shantyport Station in Coral Ward? That's where the real reward is at. Bring an NPC in here a Probopass for an in-game trade for his **Togepi** egg. Nice.

I jest, but there is one more reward we can get out of doing this renovation project. In the Grand Hall basement, a nerdy NPC in the bottom left corner will tell us about an issue with the railnet renovation. Prepare your team as needed and head over to the Byxbysion Wasteland.

Via climbing through the building as we have before, hop down a ledge at the top to reach the upper left corner of the wasteland, and enter the cave. Go left, and follow the path into a building which contains a hidden *Telluric Seed* and *Exp. Candy XL*. Proceeding left, you can enter one final section of the underground railnet. Be prepared for a mini-gauntlet.

**Pokémon Refugees. Field: Cave Field**

    - Earthquake
- Lairon, Lv. 35, @Custap Berry, Ability: Sturdy, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31
    - Earthquake

This fight exploits the cave field to collapse in on your Pokémon - instantly KO'ing most Pokémon. The Sturdy + Custap Berry combo makes it common for each Pokémon to get two attacks against you, so one collapse each. Without preparedness... that means you will lose all six of your Pokémon before the other fight! There are lots of strategies you can use to succeed here, however. Moldbreaker or multi-hit moves like Bullet Seed solve the Sturdy issue, allowing you to easily win. You can also use Power Gem constantly to change the field and prevent a collapse, or have a Bulletproof or Rock Head Pokémon do the whole fight since they are immune to the collapses. The Aron and Lairon will collapse themselves, so you could also just have something spam Wide Guard since you'll be safe from the collapse damage.

    - Rock Slide
    - Bulldoze

Possibly benefitting from the collapses your team suffer in the first battle, this doubles team goes all in on a similar strategy, this time with Rock Head to prevent any of the Aggron from taking collapse damage. With their Seeds, they'll gain defense, so your physical moves won't easily take them down in time. Wide Guard is even better this time, as your second active Pokémon can then focus on knocking out the Aggron. You can also just point-blank sweep them with two Pokémon running Aura Sphere, Focus Blast, Earth Power, Surf, and the like, so that's an option too. Again Bulletproof and Rock Head trivialize this fight.

Once you succeed in here, you can get the *Aggronite* and a hidden *Ultra Ball* and *Max Repel*. There are also encounters down here.

### Azurine Nature Center Project

Donate the $80000 to fund this project.

Surf on down to the Azurine Island once more from Coral Ward, and make your way to the building at the bottom. This will then be added as a Fly location, so you can easily get back here in the future.

Inside the building, you can get a *Toxic Plate*. You can also learn about the password *weathermod*. Upstairs, you'll find 5 *Exp. Candy XL*, as well as an *EV Booster* and *Max Ether*. If you didn't do the Chikorita event earlier, you can get it on the roof now.

In front of the building, a person will offer you an in-game trade: your Carnivine for a **Chimchar** egg. Nice.

The Azurine Island itself has been renovated as well, and we can get a few limited-choice Pokémon now!

Time to finally comb the Azurine Island for items one last time. We're also going to encounter more Foongus and Amoonguss in disguise, make sure you defeat or run from them to get them out of the way for a quest here.

This time I'll go left from the building to start. Grab the hidden *Big Mushroom* here, then another *Big Mushroom* to the left. Defeat the nearby Amoonguss, then head right. You'll find a hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and a non-hidden *Big Mushroom* below. To the right and down is another hidden *Big Mushroom* in a bush. Going up from here you can find, shocker, a hidden *Big Mushroom* left of the water.

Up the river is another hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and one out in the open to the left. Here you can meet the guy asking us to eradicate the Foongus and Amoonguss - once we finish we will return to him. To the left of him you'll find... a hidden *Blue Shard*! Surprise! Anyways, surf up and to the left from here to get a hidden *Big Mushroom* in a rock, and a hidden *Common Candy* in a bush below. Another *Big Mushroom* is hidden on the same island where we once landed for the first time. Down and to the left you can get a hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Across the water on the largest island, you can pick up another *Big Mushroom*, and a hidden *Full Heal* to the right.

Down the ledge and across the water, talk to the nature guy once more to get a *Rocky Helmet*. Sweet.

There is one more thing we can do for this restoration project. Fly over to the Grand Hall and go to the basement. In the top right hallway, you can talk to a guy who will tell you that they are looking for sample Pokémon at Azurine Island. Fly back there.

A lady on the left will give us 2 *Leaf Stones* and a mission: to donate a male and female each of Lurantis and Simisage. I recommend just breeding each using the incubator until you get the desired gender, then leveling the Fomantis up to get Lurantis and using the Leaf Stones on Pansage to get **Simisage**. Donate all four and return to the Grand Hall to get the *Grassium-Z*.

That's it for this restoration project.

## Gang Application Sidequest

The train station in Lower Peridot where we started our journey is now open. Inside, someone will give you the *Construction Application*.

Make your way down to Seventh Street and find your corresponding gang leader. He'll ask us to give matching job applications to each of the members of their gang. Note that the blast powder salesmen will still sell to you on their respective jobsites. Anyways, the correct applications:

Note that if you haven't fixed the slums yet, you won't be able to finish this quest with the Magma Gang yet. For completing it all you'll be given **Oshawott** holding a *Choice Band*.

## Starter Egg Quest (Part 1)

Head into the Grand Hall basement and enter the middle room on the left side. Kanaya will task us with donating one egg of each of the 21 starter Pokémon!

Regardless of choices, it is guaranteed that you will have been able to obtain Charmander, Squirtle, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko, Mudkip, Turtwig, Piplup, Tepig, Chespin, Fennekin, and Popplio, bringing our total to a minimum of 13 starters so far. You can search the page for these events if you'd like to get them now.

You may have Oshawott or Litten if you completed a gang sidequest, and you may also have Bulbasaur and Chimchar if you upgraded Azurine Island. Potentially you may also have one more starter, chosen at the very beginning, but for now I will just assume we have only the ones every player is guaranteed to have. Feel free to also donate these if you have them as well.

If you have the incubator, doing this breeding shouldn't take too much time, so get eggs of these 13+ Pokémon now. For donating 3, 6, 9, and 12, we'll get the *Reset Disc- HP*, *Reset Disc- ATK*, *Reset Disc- DEF*, and *Reset Disc- SPATK*. These will help us reset EV's to zero, helpful if you want to completely change up how you're running a Pokémon or get rid of junk EV's from the beginning of the game. As we get more (guaranteed) starters, we'll come back.

## Tourmaline Desert

Make your way to the train station in Lower Peridot Ward, and take the train out to the Tourmaline Desert.

### Reshiram Route Taka Fight

If you already fought Taka at the WTC, skip ahead to the next section.

If you didn't fight Taka at the WTC, now will be the time to fight him!

**Vagrant Scion Taka. Field: Desert Field**
- Chatot, Lv. 83, Ability: Keen Eye, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 4/0/0/252/0/252
    - Heat Wave
    - Nasty Plot
    - Hyper Voice
    - Encore
- Exeggutor-Alola, Lv. 77, Ability: Harvest, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/252/4/0/0
    - Nature Power
    - Dragon Hammer
    - Earthquake
    - Wood Hammer
- Klefki, Lv. 76, @Leftovers, Ability: Prankster, Bold Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/252/0/4/0
    - Substitute

    - Acrobatics
    - Rock Slide
    - Earthquake

You'll notice that Taka's team is actually decently built for the Desert Field and sand, but again an Ice type can shatter him once Klefki goes down, so this fight probably won't be too terrible for you. As always, beware of a Shell Smash Minior sweep.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Taka that you will not keep on winning (+1 Taka)

Once you win, Taka will ask if you will let him join your party while you travel through the desert. There are gameplay pluses to doing this - he will heal your party after every fight and also has tons and tons of dialogue at the various subareas of the desert. However you will have to be careful that he doesn't knock out wild Pokémon you want to catch, though you can return later once he is no longer with you.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to allow Taka to join you.**

It's worth noting that refusing him here sends you down a different story path than the Reshiram and Zekrom routes, often called the "Hell Route" by the community. (I've never played this route so if you notice inconsistencies with the guide on Hell Route please let me know.)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Don't allow Taka to come with you in the desert (-3 Taka)

If he does join you, you'll lose points for leaving the desert while he's with you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Leave the desert while Taka is your partner (-2 Taka)

Once you make your choice, it's time to start exploring the desert...

### Greater Tourmaline Desert

If you want to just blaze through the story, head straight up in the desert until you reach an area with tons of trains, then complete the 1R253 Scrapyard section and proceed from there. There are tons and tons of actually good Pokémon and items that become available around the desert, so we'll spend a while exploring side areas for now.

So, the most dreaded part of writing this guide for me has finally arrived. I'll briefly explain the problem as well as my approach. Note that this all really doesn't matter much if you're not going out of your way to collect all the hidden items so you can just grab the items and Pokémon that you want and ignore the complications.

Essentially the greater part of Tourmaline Desert is really huge. That alone makes it hard to point to specific items. However there are actually 4 versions of this large map depending on where the desert's oasis currently is, which is randomly determined to start. Each of these four maps has its own set of hidden items as well.

What I recommend is exploring the map you have landed on first without touching any of the oases - touching the light shard nearby the oasis will switch the map you're on. Doing this exactly 3 times will switch a DIFFERENT desert map between two versions, but we don't want to do this just yet. I will number the four maps 1, 2, 3, 4. Note that when you switch the map you're on you'll go to a random, different number, so to be sure you'll have to search for the oasis every time.

To find the map you're on to start, you'll want to find your oasis. I provide images of each oasis below.

Oasis 1: On the upper/middle of the left side of the desert
!img("oasis1.jpg")

Oasis 2: Middle of the right side of the desert
!img("oasis2.jpg")

Oasis 3: On the lower/middle of the left side of the desert
!img("oasis3.jpg")

Oasis 4: Bottom of the right side of the desert
!img("oasis4.jpg")

So, once you find the map you're on, now we can start getting things!

**Greater Tourmaline Desert**

|Super Rod         |%  |Water             |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Gastrodon         |44 |Mandibuzz         |65 |
|Shellos           |40 |**Gliscor**       |31 |
|Bruxish           |16 |Skarmory          |4  |

|Marowak           |4+ |
|**Cacturne**      |4+ |
|**Maractus**      |4+ |
|**Krookodile**    |4+ |
|Excadrill         |4+ |
|Dugtrio           |4+ |
|**Mandibuzz**     |4+ |
|**Darmanitan**    |4+ |
|**Heliolisk**     |4+ |
|Hippowdon         |4+ |
|**Skarmory**      |1  |
|**Scrafty**       |1  |

You'll also find many stationary **Exeggutor-Alola** around the desert.

You can encounter the same Pokémon on the various maps but at different rates. Thankfully, with the Magnetic Lure, you will be able to get whatever you don't already have easily.

For what it's worth, there are transitions from each map into two OTHER maps... which we will explore later. For now, keep in mind you don't want to go more north than these two images, the northwest and northeast borders:

!img("td_nw_border.jpg")

!img("td_ne_border.jpg")

For now, don't enter any train cars yet, either.

First, I'll start by covering all the items that you can get only once and are available on all the maps. These are all generally worth getting and I'll point you roughly towards them. This is also a good time to get acquainted with the layout of the desert! For the sake of grabbing all these items, I will generally travel along the outside of the desert starting in the upper left corner, going counter clockwise along the outside of the desert, and finally grabbing whatever is in the center of the desert. Note that the large opening in a sand dune is Sugiline Cave, for the purposes of navigation. We'll explore there later.

Note that Taka often has something to say when you find these if he is with you.

**On all maps (only obtainable once)**

- In the top left corner up on a hill, you can get hidden 3 *Exp. Candy XL*.
- As you climb down the top left hill, go slightly right as you head down. You'll see a *Stone Plate* on top of a hill.
- On the left side, you can hop across some blocks after defeating some Exeggutor-Alola to get *TM72 Volt Switch*!
- In the bottom left corner of the desert, you'll be able to pick up a *Focus Sash*.
- On the very bottom-middle of the desert you can find 6 *Poké Balls*, one is hidden. Especially with Taka in your party, you may realize where these six balls came from...
- Hugging the right wall of the desert, you'll find a *Relic Copper*.
- Past Sugiline Cave, hugging the right wall and going up, you'll find a *Max Elixir* near some dead trees.
- Up and to the right of the previous Max Elixir, you can find a hidden *Star Piece* in a rock.
- In the far northeast side of the desert, you can climb a sand dune to get onto a hill. Up and to the right you'll find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*.
- Pretty much in the center of the desert you'll see a section of vertical tracks. To the left of it, you'll see a broken statue. The main statue is too faded to read but the broken off gargoyle contains a hidden *Max Elixir*.

Aside from all these items, each of the four maps has its own list of hidden items. These aren't even particularly worth searching for but for completeness I list them here.

**Map 1**

- On the hill where we found the 3 Exp. Candies, you can find a hidden *Magical Seed*.
- A hidden *Green Shard* is in a skull above the oasis.
- A hidden *Liechi Berry*, *Elixir*, *Red Shard*, and *Resist Wing* are nearby the oasis, in the upper left side of the map below the hill.
- East of the oasis in a dead tree is a *Telluric Seed*.
- Down from the oasis is a cactus, containing a *Leaf Stone*.
- Down from here, you'll eventually find the train station where we can return to Reborn City. Hidden on the station is *Red-Hots*.
- Straight west from the station is a *Blue Shard*.
- Down and left from here you'll see a tall pillar. Northwest of it, you can get a hidden *Common Candy* in a dead tree.
- North and slightly west of the pile of Poké Balls in the south desert, you'll find a hidden *X Speed*.
- Hugging the right side of the desert and going up, you'll see a small hill and a few patches of green. One contains a hidden *Great Ball*.
- On the east side of the map, southeast of the Sugiline Cave, you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* in a desert rose flower. You'll know you're close when you see a bunch of desert rose trees.
- Straight west and slightly up from the previous item, you can find a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* between some palm trees.
- East of Sugiline Cave, you can find an *Exp. Candy XL*.
- In the northeast side of the desert map north of where we previously found the hidden Star Piece, you can get a hidden *Rawst Berry*.
- Go straight up from here. You'll see a hidden *Full Heal* in a rock.
- A decent bit west of the previous item, you'll find a hidden *Fire Gem*.
- West of the here, you can find a *Dawn Stone* hidden in a rock.
- Back on the left side of the desert, straight east of the Stone Plate rock, under some tracks you'll find a hidden *Fairy Gem*.
- Going straight east from the Fairy Gem, past the fork in the tracks you'll see a large hill. On the other side is a skull containing a *Rare Bone*.
- Down and to the left from here, you'll lose the train tracks but will eventually find them again in the sand. Left of here in a patch of green, you can get a *Dire Hit*.

**Map 2**

- On the hill where we found the 3 Exp. Candies, you can find a hidden *Chewing Gum*.

- In the northeastern corner of the desert you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball* and *Exp. Candy XL* in some rocks.
- Back down from here, slightly south and west from the oasis, you can find a hidden *Green Shard* in a skull by a hill.
- Left from the previous item you'll find train tracks. Follow these up to get a hidden *Purple Shard*.
- Up and left from here you'll find a *Bug Gem* on top of a dune.

**Map 3**

- Just below the hill where we found the 3 Exp. Candies, you can find a hidden *Heart Scale* and *Red-Hots*.
- Following the left wall down, you can get a *Blue Shard* in a bush.
- Further down the left wall, nearby a desert rose patch you can get a *Calcium* and a *Dragon Gem*.
- Follow the left wall down, on the other side of the bend in the wall you can find a hidden *Peppermint* near a dead tree.
- Nearby the oasis on the left side of the map, you can find a hidden *Relic Gold*, *Salac Berry*, and *Protein*.
- To the right and slightly up from the oasis, you'll find a hidden *Red Shard*.
- On the train platform down and to the right of the oasis you can get a hidden *Sun Stone*.
- Across the tracks from the station and slightly down you'll find a hidden *Red Shard* near a pillar.
- Slightly to the left of the pile of Poké Balls, you'll be able to find a hidden *Pop Rocks* under the tracks.

For some reason, just on this map, you can give a guy in the bottom right corner some Fresh Water in exchange for a new password: *gen5weather*. Anyways, back to the items:

- In the bottom right side of the desert, a rock will hide a *Nugget*. Just up from here in a patch of green is another rock containing a *Grass Gem*.
- Go up from here, passing between a small hill and a pillar. Up from here you'll find a desert rose containing a hidden *Ultra Ball*.
- Up from the Ultra Ball you'll see a bunch of bushes and cacti. Going right around the mountain, you'll find a hidden *Blast Powder*.
- Head way up from here. In a patch of green nearby a train track corner, towards the top right corner of the desert but a bit out from the wall, you can find a *Purple Shard*, and a *Poison Gem* just above here near a train car.
- Straight left from the Poison Gem, follow the tracks to reach a hidden *Stardust*.
- Just before you reach the top right corner of the desert, on your left is a mountain with a broken statue head beneath containing a *Steel Gem*.
- Hidden in a pile of rocks in the north east of here is a *Nugget*, and a *Green Shard* to the northeast in a bush.
- Go straight left from this area into the area with many train tracks. In a rock pile you'll be able to find a hidden *Protein*.
- Continuing left from here, slightly up is a hidden *Water Stone* fittingly in a cactus.
- Going straight left from here once more, you'll find a hidden *Poké Snax* in a rock.

**Map 4**

- On the hill where we found the 3 Exp. Candies, you can find a hidden *Common Candy*.
- Down from the hill, you'll find a bush containing another hidden *Common Candy*.
- Right from here, at the bend in the first track you'll find a rock containing a *Rock Gem*.
- Follow this track eastward. Below the first palm tree east of the bend, you'll find a hidden *Poké Ball*.
- Back at the bend to the left, go straight down. At the base of a medium-sized hill is a skull containing a hidden *Blast Powder*.
- There is a desert rose patch down and to the left from here, containing a hidden *Zinc*.
- Down from here you'll find a rock containing a *Cotton Candy*.
- Much further down the wall on the left side, in two rocks are a *Magical Seed* and *Salt-Water Taffy*.
- From the area where we got the Volt Switch TM, go straight east across the tracks to find a hidden *Iron*.
- Slightly to the northeast of the pile of Poké Balls, you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*.
- Around the oasis in the bottom right corner, you can find a hidden *Sitrus Berry*, *Dusk Ball*, and *Relic Copper*.
- Just before the Sugiline Cave on the east side of the desert you'll find an area with a lot of cacti and bushes. Nearby are 3 hidden *Green Shards*.
- Straight up from here, follow the wall up and to the right. Near the dead trees, we can find a hidden *Purple Shard*.
- Continue north and slightly left from here. In a green patch with bushes and a cactus you can find another hidden *Purple Shard*. Following the nearby tracks left, you'll find a hidden *Ultra Ball*.
- Slightly up and to the right, you'll find a hidden *Burn Heal* in a statue head at the base of a mountain and a hidden *Big Pearl* in a bush to the right.
- In the northeast corner of the map, you'll find a hidden *Escape Rope* and *X Accuracy*.
- Left from here, in a rock beneath a hill, you can find a hidden *Purple Shard*.
- Go left from here. Nearby the train cars, you can find a hidden *Blue Shard* in a rock.
- Continue going farther to the left. Just before the final vertical train tracks is a rock containing a hidden *Awakening*.
- Near the dead center of the desert, you'll find a small grove of trees near a train track. You'll find a hidden *Escape Rope*.
- Up and left from here is a patch of green containing another hidden *Green Shard*.
- Follow the nearby tracks straight down to find a hidden *Fire Stone*.

Phew! That's everything we can grab in the Greater Tourmaline Desert.

Note that if Taka is with you:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka in the Tourmaline Desert while he's with you (+1 Taka)

It's also worth noting that Taka has 36 different dialogues, some changing depending on your current location. If you talk to him in any location and he asks if you hate his father, you'll potentially get another point.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Taka you don't hate Solaris (+1 Taka)

### Northwest Tourmaline Desert

Next, we're going to explore the northwest side of the Tourmaline Desert. Thankfully there is only one map this time and it is relatively narrow. Make your way to the northwest side of the greater desert and start following the tracks up. As before, don't enter any of the traincars quite yet.

**Northwest Tourmaline Desert**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Marowak           |20 |
|Sandslash         |20 |
|**Lycanroc**      |10 |
|Krookodile        |10 |
|Excadrill         |10 |
|Dugtrio           |10 |
|Mandibuzz         |5  |
|Darmanitan        |5  |
|Heliolisk         |4  |
|Hippowdon         |4  |
|Skarmory          |1  |
|Gliscor           |1  |

From bottom to top ordered roughly you can find hidden: *Blue Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Green Shard*, *PokéSnax*, *Stardust*, *Fairy Gem*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Red Shard*, *Blue Shard*, *Purple Shard*, *Common Candy*, *Super Potion*, *Max Repel*, *Poké Ball*, *PP Up*, *Water Gem*, *Green Shard*, *Great Ball*, *Ghost Gem*, and *Potion*.

You'll also notice a few non-hidden items: along the right side you can get a *Relic Copper* and a *Max Ether*. On the left side, past a dangerous trainer with F.E.A.R., you'll be able to get *TM08 Bulk Up*.

Note that at the very top of the area we won't be able to move on thanks to an intense sandstorm - this is actually the region's border, so don't worry about trying to pass here as we will not be able to. You'll also notice a cave entrance in the top left corner - this is the Teknite Cave. I am gonna explore here later on, but you can jump to that section if you want to explore it now.

### Northeast Tourmaline Desert

Next, we're gonna checkout the final part of the outside desert area. Make your way to the upper right hand corner of the greater desert area we've explored so far.

So, there are also multiple maps going on in the Northeast Tourmaline Desert, but thankfully there are only two and it's pretty easy to tell where you are. If you haven't messed with any oases yet, you'll be on the dirty version, which I will explore first.

**Northeast Tourmaline Desert (Dirty)**

|Old Rod           |%  |Good Rod          |%  |Super Rod         |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Grimer            |100|Grimer            |60 |Muk               |100|
|                  |   |Muk               |40 |                  |   |

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Marowak           |20 |
|Cacturne          |20 |
|Maractus          |10 |
|Krookodile        |10 |
|Excadrill         |10 |
|Dugtrio           |10 |
|Mandibuzz         |5  |
|Darmanitan        |5  |
|**Lairon**        |4  |
|Hippowdon         |4  |
|Skarmory          |1  |
|Drapion           |1  |

Roughly from bottom to top, you can find a hidden *Repel*, *Calcium*, *Blue Shard*, *Stardust*, *Purple Shard*, *Pop Rocks*, *Great Ball*, *Red Shard*, *Elixir*, *Purple Shard*, *Blue Shard*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Poké Ball*, *Shiny Stone*, *Green Shard*, *Pearl*, *Telluric Seed*, and *Rare Bone*.

At the wasteland at the top you can get *TM36 Sludge Bomb*!

With this map fully explored, now we can finally proceed to mess with the oases. Essentially, as explained before, each time you touch a light shard at a mirage, the map will switch to a different one. If you've done this any multiple of three times, the map on the northeast will transform from the dirty map to the clean map. So, go search for three mirages, grab the hidden items on the respective Greater Tourmaline map you land on if you'd like, then return here to explore the Mirage version.

**Northeast Tourmaline Desert (Mirage)**

|Super Rod         |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Gastrodon         |44 |
|Shellos           |40 |
|Bruxish           |16 |

|Cave              |%  |Water             |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Marowak           |20 |Mandibuzz         |60 |
|Cacturne          |20 |Gliscor           |31 |
|Maractus          |10 |Sigilyph          |5  |
|Krookodile        |10 |Skarmory          |4  |
|Excadrill         |10 |                  |   |
|Dugtrio           |10 |                  |   |
|**Vibrava**       |5  |                  |   |
|Darmanitan        |5  |                  |   |
|Heliolisk         |4  |                  |   |
|Hippowdon         |4  |                  |   |
|Skarmory          |1  |                  |   |
|**Flygon**        |1  |                  |   |

Again roughly from bottom to top, you can find a hidden *Iron*, *Red Shard*, *Green Shard*, *Great Ball*, *PokéSnax*, *Purple Shard*, *Elixir*, *Red Shard*, *Oran Berry*, *Blast Powder*, *Aspear Berry*, *Repel*, *Magical Seed*, *Poké Ball*, and *Custap Berry*. By surfing you can find hidden *Star Piece*, *Full Restore*, and *Dusk Stone*.

Before we enter the tower, there's another thing we can do out here. Surf around the back of the tower. There's a hidden stairs directly behind the tower we can use to get onto the mountainside. Follow this path to get a hidden *Stardust*, *Swift Wing*, and *Blue Shard*.

You can pet Leafeon here for the Eeveelution petting quest. By defeating the Lv. 100 Exeggutor-Alola in the pot, you can talk to the pot to get the *Dragonium-Z*! There is also a top tier NPC and shop here.

**Marcello's Lemonade Shop**

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Lemonade*             |$350       |

After buying as much lemonade as you can carry if you'd like, head into the Mirage Tower.

## Mirage Tower

Welcome to the Mirage Tower, one of my favorite side areas in the game. We can either climb the tower or access the secret basement. I will go with the basement first.

To reach the basement, you'll need to smash every mirror along the top wall with Rock Smash. Doing this will hurt your party members, so healing them if you don't have Taka may be smart. Speaking of Taka:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka in the Mirage Tower while he's with you (+1 Taka)

Anyways, head through the opened door to the basement.

**Mirage Tower B1F**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Marowak-Alola** |29 |
|Sandslash         |24 |
|Lairon            |10 |
|Dusclops          |10 |
|Dugtrio           |10 |
|Cofagrigus        |10 |
|Banette           |6  |
|Excadrill         |1  |

This is a dark, mazelike room. To progress you will sorta have to do a clockwise spiral outward, grabbing items as you go. Hidden in the basement you can find a *Super Potion*, 2 *Red Shards*, *Purple Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, *Green Shard*, *Cotton Candy*, *Ghost Gem*, *Great Ball*, and *Heart Scale*.

Towards the top of the area, you'll notice a **Mimikyu** that you can battle and catch! Nearby it, you'll find the *Poison Memory* and a hidden *Elemental Seed*.

Return to the Mirage Tower proper. Next, we will climb the tower, solving puzzles as we go! Note that your actions on the block will affect the other, but the blocks won't move if pushed against a barrier. I will put the solutions in invisible text.

Follow the path back from here... into the Tourmaline Desert once more?

So, we can get another legendary here, if you can call it that!

Although you might be tempted to head back into the tower, try heading down from here...

Following this path will lead us to the top of Mirage Tower! Here we can pick up the *Normalium-Z*, *TM04 Calm Mind*, and **Honedge**. Excellent rewards, and I recommend training this thing up right away if one of your team members is falling off, as Aegislash is one of the best Pokémon in this game!

That's it for the Mirage Tower for now.

## Sugiline Cave

Next, I'll take us to the Sugiline Cave. Head over to the east side of the greater desert and hug the right wall until you see a massive opening in a dune, then head in.

As in the other areas:

Essentially Sugiline Cave has two floors: 1F, and B1F. Falling down a sand vortex on 1F leads you to B1F, but falling down a vortex in B1F brings you all the way back to the beginning of the cave. For this reason, I recommend quick-saving like crazy in here so you don't waste time and repels getting back to where you are.

On this first map, you can get a hidden *X Sp. Atk*, *Pop Rocks*, *Blue Shard*, and *Ultra Potion*. Drop down the bottom-left vortex first to B1F.

Grab the hidden *Elemental Seed* and *Big Mushroom* and take the ladder to 1F.

On this map you can get a hidden *Elemental Seed*, *Red Shard*, *Great Ball*, and *Ultra Ball*. Step into the bottom-left most vortex to get a *Max Elixir*. Unfortunately from here we have no choice but to step into the vortex to return to the front of the dungeon, so take the bottom left vortex and follow the path to where we were before.

This time, take the vortex up and slightly right from the pot that contained the Great Ball. In this area of B1F you can find a hidden *Cheri Berry*, *Protein*, and *Ether*. Again, we'll have to jump in a vortex from here and return to the 1F level above.

This time, take the top right vortex, then climb the ladder in the area you land in. Up here, pick up the *Draco Plate* and hidden *Super Repel*. Again jump into the vortices and make your way back to 1F.

Jump in the top left vortex this time. You can find a hidden *PokéSnax* in this room. Void out and return for the final time, in this section of the dungeon, at least!

Finally, jump into the vortex on the left side of the pot. Climb the ladder at the top of the rocky path.

In this next room, you can find a hidden *X Speed* and *Dark Gem*. Be extra careful here, as all vortices but the correct one will immediately yeet you back to the starting point. The correct one is the one in the middle of the top three, so head down it.

On B1F, be careful to not fall in again and pick up hidden *Telluric Seed*, *Super Potion*, and *Red Shard*, then climb the ladder on the right side.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* and proceed into the room on the right. Push the button in the Arceus statue to finish the left section of the cave! Make your way back to the entrance.

Next, step into the bottom right vortex in the entry room.

In this room, you can get a hidden *Carbos*, *Pecha Berry*, and *Blue Shard*. Climb the ladder at the top.

In this next room, you can find 2 hidden *Elemental Seeds*, *PokéSnax*, and *Green Shard*. Jump into the vortex on the middle of the right side of the room, below a cactus. Pick up a *Link Stone* then void out and return to the previous room.

Next, jump into the middle of the top three vortices. Be careful here as you grab hidden *Ice Heal*, *Antidote*, and *Star Piece*. Climb the ladder on the left side and push the button in the Arceus statue. Return to the front of the dungeon.

Next, enter the vortex at the very top of the entrance room. Down here you can find a hidden *X Speed* and *PP Up*. Climb the ladder to get a *Magical Seed* and hidden *Star Piece*, then return to the front of the dungeon.

Finally, hop down the vortex straight up from the cave's entrance. Here, you can find a hidden *Synthetic Seed*, *Blue Shard*, *Great Ball*, and *Common Candy*.

In the next room, grab a hidden *Genius Wing* and *Exp. Candy XL*, then proceed into the next room. You might wanna save here - all the Garchomp statues can come alive and fight you!

While a fast Ice type can make this not really a problem, they can wear most teams down quickly. Technically you can actually get through this room without having a single battle with very careful movement, so figure out how to get through however you like.

Explore this room. You can find 2 hidden *Red Shards*, *Elemental Seed*, *Ultra Ball*, *Great Ball*, *Blast Powder*, *Purple Shard*, and *Iron*. At the top, you can get *TM71 Stone Edge*!

Talk to the Arceus statue at the top, and vortices will show up all around. Hop down any one of them to reach Sugiline Ruin B1F.

On this floor, you can find the *Medichamite*, an *Impish Mint*, *Bold Mint*, and 3 *Exp. Candy XL* as well as a hidden *Super Potion*, *Escape Rope*, 2 *Green Shards*, *Dragon Gem*, and *Muscle Wing*.

You can also interact with the basins around the area and put in some snax. Head up the ladder, then jump down the corresponding vortex above that basin. You'll be able to battle and catch **Gible**! Very nice. Head out of the dungeon via a nearby vortex and return to the desert.

## Teknite Cave & Teknite Ridge

Next, we're going to take a trip to the Teknite Cave in the northwest corner of the Tourmaline Desert. You can save some time by having Pokémon in your party with Power Gem, a ground-shaking move (TM Bulldoze works), and Tailwind, but we can proceed without these moves by having wild Pokémon use them in battle. Enter the cave.

As in the other areas:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka while he's with you in the Teknite Cave/Ridge (+1 Taka)

**Teknite Cave Dry Areas**

|Gigalith          |1  |
|**Aggron**        |1  |

In the first room, grab the hidden *Tamato Berry* then proceed to 2F. In the next, grab the *Mountain Field Readout*, *Dawn Stone*, and hidden *Magical Seed*.

You'll notice that the "stones shimmer with light" when you enter. As we know by now that means we have to change the field somehow to proceed - we'll need to transform the Cave Field into Crystal Cavern Field. The only way we can right now is via use of Power Gem - note that wild Carbink can use this move, so if you don't have it on you, you can just encounter one and hope it uses this move. After the cave is transformed, use the red crystal to create a rock smash wall, and proceed to 3F.

Grab the hidden *Purple Shard* then transform the field to Crystal Cavern. Use the green crystal to remove the obstacle. Note that we won't be able to proceed - you'll need to use Bulldoze, Earthquake, Magnitude, or Fissure to switch back to Cave from here. If you don't have these moves, wild Sandslash, Dugtrio, and maybe others should have one of these moves. Once the field is changed and a gem is destroyed to clear a path, move to the top of this room then switch to Crystal Cavern once more. Use the crystal, smash the wall, and proceed to 4F.

Switch to Crystal Cavern, then remove the obstacle. Grab the hidden *Iron* and *Potion*. Switch back to Cave and grab a hidden *Burn Heal* at the top and *Mental Herb* at the bottom. Enter the bottom left room to re-enter 3F, grab the hidden *Synthetic Seed*, and proceed to the room on the left.

Surf to a hidden *Repel*. Switch to a Cave Field and use the blue crystal at the bottom to cross the water. Grab a hidden *Magical Seed* and proceed. Grab the *Buginium-Z* and the hidden *Blue Shard*. Return to 4F, this time going through the top left exit.

Pushing the strength boulders out of the way, hop across to the bottom left corner to get a hidden *Relic Copper*. Hopping to the top right, you can get a hidden *Health Wing*. Finally, hop to the top left to re-enter Teknite Cave. Grab a hidden *Paralyze Heal* and proceed to the next Teknite Ridge map.

On this map, you can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Roseli Berry*, *Potion*, *Escape Rope*, *Quick Ball* as well as 3 *Exp. Candy XL* and *TM75 Swords Dance*. Hop across some rocks to the left to get a hidden *Nugget* and the *Mawilite*!

Return to the 4F map with branching paths, this time going up and right. On this map, you won't be able to fully explore as is, but by using Tailwind in a battle, you can now jump three horizontal spaces instead of two! Wild Pidgeot and Talonflame may use this move if you don't have it on you.

Hop your way to the next by the entrance to get the *Pidgeotite*. Hopping to the right from here you'll find the *Ice Memory*. Back nearby the entrance, hop slightly up and left to get a hidden *Hyper Potion* in a rock. Hop to the landmass to your right, and grab the hidden *Leppa Berry*. Hugging the top left as much as possible, hop across to the top-left corner of the map. Jump down just one ledge, then go right. Hop to a nearby rock for a hidden *Level Ball*, then grab the *PP Max* at the top.

Hop back to the central landmass, this time climbing a bit higher and hopping to the right. It's a bit hard to spot, but to proceed, you'll need to hop at the top left corner of the next landmass up and around to the next landmass at the top. Hopping down one ledge, go right and hop up and around. Follow this path to the top of the hill to get a **Rowlet** egg!

That's it for the Teknite Range, so feel free to fly out of here back to Lower Peridot if you want.

## 1R253 Scrapyard

If you have Taka with you and want him to stay with you for more points, conversations, and free heals, save this area for later, as once we get a fair bit in, he will leave our side.

As in the other areas:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Taka while he's with you in the 1R253 Scrapyard (+1 Taka)

Time to proceed to the next story area! You've probably seen a large area surrounded by tons of traincars in the central northern desert - this is our destination. Actually, to start, make your way to the Northwestern Tourmaline Desert to start.

At the bottom right of this map but before you enter the Greater Tourmaline map, you will find a entrance to a train car. Go through this train car, and you'll emerge in the 1R253 Scrapyard!

Go straight up and grab the *Max Repel*. Towards the bottom of the area you'll see a green train with an open door - getting inside, we can use it to move forward, unless there is a Rock Smash boulder on the track. This puzzle is a pretty fun one in my opinion, so feel free to skip ahead until the next section if you'd like to try to solve it all yourself.

So, use this train to go forward, pushing a different train onto some vertical tracks. From here, go straight up and into a train car. Follow the path through many different cars until you emerge once more. Smash the rock then backtrack through this train. Going down then left and back up, you can now use the train at the top to go right.

From here, you'll be... railroaded... into going to the right and down. Once you hop down a horizontal ledge look to the right to smash a rock, then continue down your path. Finally, you'll be spit out in the main area of the scrapyard. If you enter the train cars at the very bottom, you can return to the Greater Tourmaline Desert, so if you need to fly out of here to heal, that's where you'll return.

Head up and enter the nearby train, then hop down the ledge to the left. Smash two rocks below and to the left. Continuing left and down, enter the train. It will only go a few tiles, so head right from here to enter the next train. On top of the hill, grab the *Max Repel* and *Steel Memory*, then jump down. Head left around this hill and smash the rock, then go back down below the hill, and enter the nearest green train to the right. This will drop you off near another green train, which you can now ride west.

From here, go down as far as you can, then head right. We are going to exit this area via the train cars at the bottom. Back on the outside of the scrapyard, head to the right, and you'll see another traincar entrance to the scrapyard. Use this entrance to re-enter the scrapyard.

This path will take you to a train, which you can now ride all the way left. Once it bumps a train out of the way, go down from here and enter the vertical train to go up to enter a new map!

Grab the hidden *Dire Hit* and *Synthetic Seed* on the map. Enter the horizontal train in the bottom left, then climb the hill. Hop down the ledges to climb down the hill. Follow the new path far to the southwest to get 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, then jump in the nearby train and ride it left. Head back to the top right and take the vertical train for a ride downward!

Grab the hidden *Big Mushroom* and enter the nearby train car. Follow the path through these cars until you emerge once more into the outside air.

This area is sometimes referred to as Train Town and thankfully you'll be able to fly here in the future. Taka leaves your party here as well.

Around this area, you can pick up a *Max Repel* as well as hidden *Common Candy*, *Purple Shard*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Aspear Berry*, *Red Shard*, *Poké Ball*, *Purple Shard*, and *PokéSnax*.

If Taka is with you, he will take a rest and lie down in a train car on the bottom right side of the area. Talk to Europa before you follow him if you like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Europa Taka is your boyfriend (+1 Taka)

You can talk to the residents of the Train Town and learn about them. In the bottom left train, if you've been to Mirage Tower, you'll see a warp that will bring you there. Handy.

Depending on the time of day, Bouffalant Bill will be either outside or in a train car on the upper right side of the area that contains a healing machine. He will sell us some stuff.

**Bouffalant Bill Shop**

|Item           |Price      |
|---------------|-----------|
|*Poké Ball*    |$200       |
|*Great Ball*   |$600       |
|*Ultra Ball*   |$1200      |
|*Max Repel*    |$900       |
|*Escape Rope*  |$550       |
|*Full Heal*    |$600       |
|*Ultra Potion* |$1200      |

In a train car at the top of the area you can access a PC and meet Stephoscope. Talking to her twice after visiting Teknite Ridge, you'll be given the *Houndoominite*. Excellent.

More importantly than all that though... by talking to *him* on the east side of Train Town, we can finally finish *the* quest. You know the one - we started it 5 minutes into the game when the fisherman and his buddy sold us a Pokémon and then stole it from us. We've watched our Pokémon by rights get taken by a guy in the slums, stolen by both the Magma Gang and Aqua Gang, and taken into the possession of an associate of the slimy Seventh Street Pokémon salesman. Next it was stolen by Corin Rouge, who had three of his associates bamboozle us long enough to escape into the desert. We paid the gold price for the Pokémon sixteen episodes ago. But now it's time to pay the iron price by defeating Corin Rouge once and for all.

This cruel thief has a Z-move and some Pokémon with Desert Field synergy, but they shouldn't be too tough to take out. Just be careful of the sixth, who can easily sweep your team if you aren't careful.

By defeating him we can finally get our hands on our legendary weapon: **Magikarp**. I jest, but Gyarados is one of the strongest Pokémon in the game, so it is indeed worth it.

Make your way out of the Train Town via the train car at the bottom. In the next area you can get a hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *X Speed*. You'll notice an entrance to a train car in the top right corner, which is where we'll go to continue the story. For now there are a couple goodies in the scrapyard that we couldn't access before, so I'll get those first.

Down and right from here you can find the *Amulet Coin* and a hidden *Blue Shard*. Left of here you'll find a *Max Repel* and a hidden *Heart Scale* and *Green Shard*. Enter the train at the end of the path, picking up the *Exp. Candy XL* and *Star Piece* in the pit. Climb out via the railroad tracks, and follow the track that this train just took up to get *TM19 Roost*.

Next, head down from here, then left as soon as you're able. Make your way to the top left corner of the area, where you'll now be able to pick up a *Max Elixir*.

That wraps up all we can get in the scrapyard, so fly back over to Train Town, exit out the bottom and enter the train car in the top right corner of the next area.

Follow the path through a ton of train cars until you emerge... what?

## Once Upon a Somewhere

You'll find yourself in a new location entirely. Not what you expected, huh?

**Once Upon a Somewhere / Once Upon a Waste of Time**

|Land              |%  |Headbutt          |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|

|Altaria           |1  |
|**Florges**       |1  |

It seems like this first map is an infinite maze - it essentially is. Try biking in random directions until you see a set of stairs ascending upwards, then take those. You'll see them eventually, I'm sure.

On the next map, you can find a hidden *Green Shard* and *Sitrus Berry*. Proceed into the castle. Here, you'll have to fight some Knights as you proceed.

You'll wake up in a tower. Read the placards at each floor as you go up or down the stairs until you see a pile of books leading out of a window.

On the exterior of the tower, climb the vines. On the left at the top you'll see the *Dragon's Den Field Readout*. As you head right, Titania will talk to you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Titania you trust her, while you have >= 0 points with her (+1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you trust her, while you have < 0 points with her (-1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you don't trust her, while you have >= 0 points with her (-1 Titania)
- Tell Titania you don't trust her, while you have < 0 points with her (Titania's total becomes *f(c)*), where *f(c) = min(0, c + 4)* and *c* is the current number of points you have with her.

Complicated, but anyways, she'll give you the *Sapphire Bracelets*. Proceed right.

Grab the hidden *Super Potion*, *Ultra Potion*, and non-hidden *Dragon Fang* in the Belly of the Beast, then prepare for a battle. Depending on your choices, it'll be different.

If you're on, well, Reshiram Route, you'll get this:

The Legendary Dragon. Field: Dragon's Den
- Reshiram, Lv. 90, @Elemental Seed, Ability: Turboblaze, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/0/252/4/0
    - Blue Flare
    - Roost
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Solar Beam

Whereas, surprise, if you're on Zekrom Route, you'll get this:

The Legendary Dragon. Field: Dragon's Den
- Zekrom, Lv. 90, @Groundium-Z, Ability: Teravolt, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/4/0/252/0/0
    - Bolt Strike
    - Roost
    - Outrage
    - Earth Power

At least now you know why the routes are named as they are. Win your conquest with whatever clever tactics or raw strength you need to slay a dragon, and proceed.

Pick up the hidden *Health Wing*, *Revive*, and *Lava Cookie* beyond, and watch the scenes play out at the top of the room.

Head up at the top to Titania's arena!

## Alloy Badge

Before starting the battle, you can jump into the blue hole at the top and go left from here if you want a shortcut to Train Town for some prep - there's a good chance your team won't be good enough for the upcoming gym fight. Anyways, up from here is a hole you can jump into to return to the tower. Along the way back to the gym, you'll even find a *Rare Candy*!

    - King's Shield
    - Shadow Sneak
    - Swords Dance
    - Sacred Sword

The Fairy Tale arena boosts Fairy and Dragon moves, along with giving Fire moves a Dragon sub-typing. It also boosts Steel moves and gives them effectiveness on Dragon. Defensively, Steel types already resist Fairy and Dragon, so with the nerf to Fire moves, Titania definitely uses the type best positioned on this field. Instead of Sandstorm, this fight is accompanied by Hail, which allows her Sandslash to outspeed and set up Aurora Veil if it likes. Past that, Empoleon, Excadrill, and Mega Scizor are all very strong steel types with lots of coverage, the latter even having a very nasty Technician, field boosted, priority Bullet Punch, and Excadrill a nasty boosted Smart Strike. Klefki is very annoying as usual thanks to prankster Paralysis on command but also humorously can sweep you with Calm Mind and boosted Draining Kiss to heal. As you'd expect, her Aegislash five levels above the cap with insane boosts on three of its moves is no slouch - bulking up when it uses King's Shield and getting stronger when it attacks, priority or otherwise. On top of this, Excadrill and Aegislash have Magical Seeds, protecting their Pokémon for a turn, lowering your stats if you try to attack them, and allowing them each to set up a +3 Swords Dance. Scary! (just know that in previous versions the seed would also boost Attack for free...)

There are a good number of strategies that remain for you to use, thankfully. A Pokémon with Protect, Swords Dance, and a move like Earthquake or Brick Break can probably sweep through most of the team with a bit of speed control support as long as they can live a priority attack or two. There are a ton of abilities and moves that allow you to gain Defense, so if you're able to deal with Klefki and Empoleon there may be a working strategy involving going all in on Defense boosts to neutralize her attack boosts and such. There are also some boosts to attacks and abilities: Mystical Fire / Magician and Sparkling Aria / Oceanic Operetta do get boosted here if you want to try to sweep with your starter Delphox or Primarina! Queenly Majesty gives a boost to damage, combine this with its natural ability to cancel out Bullet Punch and Shadow Sneak, and Tsareena may end up being very helpful here. The Magical Seed giving a free turn can also be used by you, with the added bonus of you being able to hard switch in to a contact move to force a stat lower on one of her party members if need be. If you're really stuck, you can literally consider going 6 Magical Seeds held to grant yourself 6 free turns - this is what I did once upon a time to win this fight with a Fairy monotype.

For winning, you'll get the *Alloy Badge*, boosting the level cap to 90. You also get *TM91 Flash Cannon*.

Jump down the pit at the top and go left to return to Train Town.

## Reborn Restoration Project 2

Pokémon Reborn Episode 17 actually came out and allowed players to get two badges, so there is still a bit of content left in the chapter. First is some optional content.

If you haven't yet gotten the Mega-Z Ring, the quest will now be opened back up if you'd like to complete it now. Head over to the Nightclub and talk to Arclight to get started, then checkout the respective [section of the walkthrough](#mega-z-ring-quest) for steps. Even if you have completed this part, fly over to the Nightclub anyways, where you can pet Jolteon for the quest.

Head over to the Grand Hall. Now that we've beaten Titania, we can fund another restoration project.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fund Project #2 (+1 Adrienn)

If you'd like to complete another one, the choices and corresponding references are here:

- [Affordable Living in Obsidia](#affordable-living-in-obsidia-project) ($60000)
- [Railnet Reconstruction](#railnet-reconstruction-project) ($100000)
- [Azurine Nature Center](#azurine-nature-center-project) ($80000)

There is one more thing we can do before continuing: fly over to Calcenon City.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in Calcenon City after defeating Titania (+1 Hardy)

## Torrent Badge

With that out of the way, we can pretty much head right to the next gym. Fly to the Celestinine Cascade and enter the Fiore Mansion. You can pet Vaporeon for that quest, and talk to Julia for some A+ gym advice. Enter the gym room at the back.

### Reshiram Route: Fiore Gym

If you're on the Zekrom Route, skip ahead to the next section.

Unfortunately this gym's layout is super confusing, but I will guide us through. For now, dive down here and then make your way down at the three-way fork. Thankfully this way is very linear, so go straight. Once you have two waterfalls to choose from, go up the left to get a hidden *Heart Scale* then proceed.

Surface in the gym room, then talk to Amaria. Use the warp to return to the front of the gym, for it's time to look for Amaria. You'll need to find her three times.

This time, head right at the underwater fork. When you surface, you can get a hidden *Full Restore*. The path from here is linear. When you surface next, you can get a hidden *Ultra Potion* on the left. Continuing, when you encounter a fork, go down instead of left. Amaria #1 is encountered in the next room, on the left side of the loop.

Continue into the next room in the bottom right. Going right at the fork will lead you to an *Elemental Seed*. Follow the path through, surfacing. Continue to follow the path at the next dive spot. At the fork, go left instead of right.

Exit this next room at the top and surface to get a *Max Revive*. Dive back down, this time exiting the large room in the southeast exit. Exit this room on the northeast side.

Go left at the first fork to reach the *Slowbronite*! Back at the fork head straight up, and then left as soon as you can to surface. There's a hidden *Ability Capsule* at the base of the waterfall. Grab it, then head back up the waterfall and dive down into the room we were just in. In the southeast is Amaria #2. From here, head into the room we previously visited in the southwest corner.

You'll find Amaria #3 in the pocket towards the center of the room.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Find Amaria #3 and say no (-4 Amaria)
- Find Amaria #3 and say yes (-3 Amaria)

After the scenes that play out here, you'll end up in the Fiore Mansion. Prepare yourself, then return to the gym when ready.

Take the teleporter to the gym arena and talk to Amaria.

Amaria will ask you if you want to battle in Singles or Doubles - but she'll actually challenge you in the format opposite of what you request!

Surprise, the Water gym leader has a team built for the Water Surface and Underwater Fields. These fields, especially the latter, are pretty suffocating for most Pokémon, drastically slowing them down and allowing Amaria to hit hard with Whirlpool, Dive, etc. On the surface Electric types and maybe Grass types can get away with their usual tricks somewhat, although with Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Swampert you won't have the easiest time sweeping and the group all have lots of coverage, and on Reshiram route only, the latter can Mega Evolve! These three also have Swift Swim, which is always on for these two fields. Wishiwashi doesn't stop schooling, so keep that in mind. Lapras with its seed and Curse can set up on you and is also immune to status conditions on these fields, so you might be in for a shock if it sets up and is unkillable. This team isn't super complicated, just hits hard and is prepared to deal with most of what you throw at it.

You can consider trying to change up the field - Murkwater Surface can wear down her Pokémon with chip damage... although she can change it back with half of her team's Whirlpool. Icy Surface can allow you to actually use hazards and ignore all the speed shenanigans... although she can change it back with Swampert's Earthquake or two uses of Kingdra's Scald. You can also create a team specifically for one of the fields. Raichu-Alola for example does great on the Water Surface, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokémon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokémon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water type moves. Especially Underwater, your own Water types with Swift Swim can be very useful here as well - if you can get past her Kingdra, your own Ludicolo can be particularly good here. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.

    - Protect
    - Rest
    - Perish Song
    - Surf

Amaria's Doubles team is built well around the Water Surface and the spread of Surf to your party while taking little/no damage from the spread to her party members, as Vaporeon and Seismitoad both have Water Absorb. This means your own Water types will potentially have a harder time on this fight than the singles fight. With Primarina'and Blastoise's coverage, Lanturn to check your Electric types and no-status condition Lapras to potentially ruin a sweeper's day thanks to Perish Song and Protect, she has a pretty bulky team that can deal with lots of teams you attempt to use. On Zekrom Route only, her Blastoise can mega-evolve, making its Aura Sphere a bit stronger and raising its stats somewhat.

As with the singles fight you may consider transforming the field. Murkwater Surface will deal passive damage to her team members each turn... but Lanturn and Blastoise may change it back with Whirlpool. Icy Field helps alleviate the speed issues, boosts, etc... but can be changed back with Seismitoad's Earthquake. The latter is potentially a good route to go with if you have a fast special-attacking Grass type who can one shot Seismitoad on turn 1. You can also try using the Water Surface or Underwater to your advantage - without Swift Swim on any of her Pokémon, bringing some Swift Swimmers of your own might let you outspeed and crush her with the right setups. Raichu-Alola can do ok on the Water Surface in this fight, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokémon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokémon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water type moves. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.


Regardless of which fight you chose, you'll be rewarded with the *Torrent Badge* and *TM55 Scald*. Sweet.

### Zekrom Route: Fiore Gym

Continue into the next room in the bottom right. Going right at the fork will lead you to an *Elemental Seed*. Follow the path through, surfacing. Continue to follow the path at the next dive spot. At the fork, go left instead of right. The next room contains Amaria #1 swimming around the upper loop.

Exit this room at the top and surface to get a *Max Revive*. Dive back down, this time exiting the large room in the southeast exit. In a loop to the right, you'll find Amaria #2. Exit this room on the northeast side.

Go left at the first fork to reach the *Slowbronite*! Back at the fork head straight up, and then left as soon as you can to surface. There's a hidden *Ability Capsule* at the base of the waterfall. Grab it, then head back up the waterfall and dive down into the room we were just in. In the northeast is Amaria #3. From here, head into the room we previously visited in the southwest corner.

Continue through this room and follow the path to the next in the bottom left corner. Exit the next room via the left-most exit, and at the fork in the next room, go right. Surface here, then follow the path at the next dive spot. This is the fork where we started our diving, so enter the door at the top and surface, then leave. Prepare yourself, then return to the gym when ready.

Take the teleporter to the gym arena and talk to Titania, then to Amaria.

Amaria will ask you if you want to battle in Singles or Doubles.

Amaria's Doubles team is built well around the Water Surface and the spread of Surf to your party while taking little/no damage from the spread to her party members, as Vaporeon and Seismitoad both have Water Absorb. This means your own Water types will potentially have a harder time on this fight than the singles fight. With Primarina'and Blastoise's coverage, Lanturn to check your Electric types and no-status condition Lapras to potentially ruin a sweeper's day thanks to Perish Song and Protect, she has a pretty bulky team that can deal with lots of teams you attempt to use. On Zekrom Route only, her Blastoise has a Fighting type Z-move, as well.

As with the singles fight you may consider transforming the field. Murkwater Surface will deal passive damage to her team members each turn... but Lanturn and Blastoise may change it back with Whirlpool. Icy Field helps alleviate the speed issues, boosts, etc... but can be changed back with Seismitoad's Earthquake. The latter is potentially a good route to go with if you have a fast special-attacking Grass type who can one shot Seismitoad on turn 1. You can also try using the Water Surface or Underwater to your advantage - without Swift Swim on any of her Pokémon, bringing some Swift Swimmers of your own might let you outspeed and crush her with the right setups. Raichu-Alola can do ok on the Water Surface in this fight, and Dhelmise can be really powerful Underwater. Any Pokémon with Water Absorb, Dry Skin, or Storm Drain such as Heliolisk and Cradily can also neutralize many of the attacks she will try to use and let you wear out her Pokémon, potentially to Toxic stall or take away her PP with the non-Water type moves. There are lots of strategies that you can use here once you get around how solid her team is in the the Water / Underwater fields.


Regardless of which fight you chose, you'll be rewarded with the *Torrent Badge* and *TM55 Scald*. Sweet.
