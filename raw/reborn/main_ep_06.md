# Episode 6: Poison In Vein

Head out from the Abandoned Power Plant and return to Jasper Ward and attempt to enter Peridot. You'll meet up with Cain here, so follow him into the Police Station and watch the scene.

Before we continue with the story, head over to the Opal Ward. Once more, there are new trainers on the bridge.

**Psychic Rin. Field: No Field**
- Pumpkaboo, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Yamask, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Psychic Damon. Field: No Field**

**Techie Caleb. Field: No Field**
- Porygon, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Head over to the Lapis Alleyway during a windy night. There, you'll find **Murkrow**!

## Blacksteam Factory

Head to the factory on the west side of Peridot. We can talk to the characters here for some points.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Cain we can trust Ace (+1 Ace, +1 Amaria, -1 Cain)
- Tell Cain we cannot trust Ace (+1 Cain, -1 Ace)

Talk to Ace and tell them your favorite nature, and they'll give you the respective *Mint*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Get a mint from Ace (+1 Ace)

Talk to Amaria to get on top of the building, and head in.

**Meteor Grunt Ricardo & Meteor Grunt Hilda. Field: Factory Field**
- Lairon, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Golbat, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Defeat the grunts with Amaria, then go down the stairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Amaria you trust her (+1 Amaria)
- Tell Amaria you don't trust her (-1 Amaria)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Ace you think they might be a double double agent (+1 Ace)
- Tell Ace you don't think they could be a double double agent (-1 Ace)

With that, we'll be plunked into a cage with a bunch of Pokémon. Essentially we need to combine Loudred's powers of deafening, Jigglypuff's powers of putting the guard to sleep, and Abra's powers of teleportation to move Pokémon around and attack the cages. In the top left if we saved the day-care couple and talked to the Meteor in Coral Ward, you'll see a Ditto, and we can get some goodies with it. To get all the goodies and escape from the cage, talk to the Pokémon in this order:

- Loudred
- Abra
- Vanillite
- Abra
- Lickitung
- Lickitung/Ditto: Doing this will get you a *Rare Candy*.
- Abra
- Lickitung/Ditto
- Abra
- Makuhita
- Makuhita/Ditto: Doing this will get you **Ditto**!
- Abra
- Vanillite
- Abra
- Cyndaquil
- Loudred
- Jigglypuff
- Cyndaquil: use Flamethrower
- Loudred
- Abra
- Cyndaquil
- Abra
- Vanillite
- Loudred
- Jigglypuff
- Vanillite: use Ice Beam
- Loudred
- Abra
- Vanillite
- Abra
- Roggenrola
- Loudred
- Jigglypuff
- Roggenrola: use Rock Blast
- Loudred

Now you can escape and talk to the guard for a fight.

**Meteor Grunt Sanchez. Field: Factory Field**
- Shelmet, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Palpitoad, Lv. 35, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

As a bonus: use Abra to teleport the guard into a cage. Nice.

Pick up a hidden *Dire Hit* on this floor, then go down the stairs to the left. In this room you can find a *Magnet Powder*, *Exp. Candy L*, *TM49 Echoed Voice* and the *PULSE Readout 4*.

Head back upstairs and take the stairs on the right to 1F.

**Techie Naoman. Field: Factory Field**
- Zorua, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Spoink, Lv. 35, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Grab the *Super Potion*.

**Meteor Grunt Devin. Field: Factory Field**
- Croagunk, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Graveler-Alola, Lv. 35, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Meteor Knight Kenan. Field: Factory Field**
- Machop, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Graveler, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Beat the grunts and activate the wall panel in the top right corner. This allows you to enter and exit the factory freely, on the right side of the room. Pick up hidden *Purple Shard* and *Super Repel* on this floor.

**Meteor Dame Diana. Field: Factory Field**
- Electrike, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Gloom, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Salandit, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Towards the bottom of the area you'll find more stairs, so take these to go up to 2F.

**Meteor Knight Steven. Field: Factory Field**
- Charjabug, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Mudsdale, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Grab the hidden *Revive* to the left, then go to the right here. Talk to the machine with some green lights on it to get *Exp. Candy L*.

**Techie Deryl. Field: Factory Field**
- Trevenant, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Charjabug, Lv. 35, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

You can find a *Thunderstone* here.

**Meteor Dame Avril. Field: Factory Field**
- Finneon, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Gothorita, Lv. 34, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Activate the panel at the top right and go back downstairs. To the left, you'll see an open door. Get ready for battle.

**Meteor Admin ZEL (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Factory Field**
- Glaceon, Lv. 37, @Never-Melt Ice, Ability: Ice Body, Hardy Nature, IVs: 31
    - Ice Shard
    - Icy Wind
    - Mirror Coat
    - Bite
- Espeon, Lv. 37, @Twisted Spoon, Ability: Magic Bounce, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Morning Sun
    - Psychic
    - Signal Beam
    - Yawn
- Umbreon, Lv. 37, @Lum Berry, Ability: Synchronize, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Moonlight
    - Assurance
    - Quick Attack
    - Confuse Ray
- PULSE Muk, Lv. 42, @Leftovers, Ability: Protean, Modest Nature, IVs: 31.
    - Sludge Wave
    - Mud Bomb
    - Muddy Water
    - Discharge

This time ZEL comes at us with both a PULSE and three Eeveelutions. The first three members of the team aren't particularly tough - something with a bit of physical bulk and a healing option can take Umbreon, while a fast physical attacker or two can deal with Glaceon and Espeon.

The PULSE Muk can be difficult to deal with. It has a bit more speed than Tangrowth, but still not enough that you won't be able to outspeed it with most Pokémon. It's Protean ability gives it STAB on field boosted Discharge and Muddy Water and makes it a bit hard to plan your offense since it changes types. While its 97 Sp. Atk isn't monumental, with 105 HP, 250 Special Defense, and Leftovers, you won't really be able to do anything to it with special moves. Knock Off is a good idea here to prevent it's recovery, or you can opt to hit really hard with two or three physical attackers that are able to capitalize on Protean with moves super effective against Poison / Ground / Water / Electric depending on what it's used last.

Once you win, you'll get the *Harbor Key*.

## Apophyll Beach

Make your way towards the Coral Ward and enter the locked warehouse in the top left. Inside, you can take the boat to Apophyll Beach!

As soon as you enter, go straight left and weave between the hills to get a *Wave Incense*.

**Apophyll Beach**

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |Old Rod           |%  |

|                  |   |**Binacle**       |5  |                  |   |

You can also catch **Pyukumuku** chilling all around the beach.

Hidden along this part of the beach you can find a *Green Shard*, 4 *Shoal Shells*, 2 *Red Shards*, *Hyper Potion*, 2 *Stardusts*, 2 *PokéSnax*, *Common Candy*, *Full Heal*, *Blue Shard*.

|Binacle           |1  |                  |   |

Before we continue the story, head to the left side of the academy to reach a new section of beach. Go down and left from here.

**Hiker Jack. Field: Rocky Field**
- Archen, Lv. 38, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

You'll see the entrance to Pyrous Mountain here - we won't be entering quite yet. Make your way up the western part of the beach from here.

**Nature Girl Ici. Field: Ashen Beach**
- Throh, Lv. 38, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Psychic Juan. Field: Ashen Beach**
- Raichu-Alola, Lv. 38, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

On the western beach, you can find hidden items:  *Swift Wing*, *Green Shard*, *Star Piece*, *Telluric Seed*, 3 *Shoal Shells*, 2 *Stardusts*, 2 *Purple Shards*, *Exp. Candy L*, *X Sp. Def*, and *Red Shard*.

If it is storming, you can find a **Corsola** on the left side of the area who will join you in exchange for snax.

The Apophyll Cave is up from here, but we will return in a bit. Head back to the Apophyll Academy. Now, we're going to head inside.

!shop("Apophyll Academy", ["Super Potion", "Common Candy", "Antidote", "Awakening", "Paralyze Heal", "Burn Heal", "Escape Rope", "Super Repel", "Poké Ball"])

Head up to reach the middle part of the area.

**Black Belt Ryan. Field: Ashen Beach**
- Chimchar, Lv. 35, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Monferno, Lv. 35, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Nature Girl Cocoa. Field: Ashen Beach**

- Primeape, Lv. 38, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Battle Girl Lisa. Field: Ashen Beach**
- Poliwhirl, Lv. 38, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Pick up a hidden *Guard Spec.* Now we are going to enter the six doors in this area: the top left has a *Black Belt*, the girl in the bottom left wants us to steal a TV for her (in a bit), the Dudebro in the top right wants Protein in exchange for his *Ashen Beach Field Readout*, the guy in the middle right will give us *Pure Incense*, the bottom right room contains a person who will tell us about the *unrealtime* password and a person who judges Hidden Power types.

Enter the area at the top, then go up the stairs. Talk to every NPC here and agree to study with those who ask. One is a tutor.

!tutor("Apophyll Academy Move Tutor", ["Gastro Acid", "Recycle", "Endeavor", "Pain Split"], ["1 Blue Shard", "2 Purple Shards", "3 Green Shards", "3 Red Shards"])

Head out the door on the bottom right, then walk across the roof. In the next room, talk to the NPCs again and study with them. Head out the door to the left, and talk to the girl on the roof to get **Meditite**.

Relationship Point Chocies:
- Obtain Meditite (+1 Victoria)

Back down from here, attempt to steal the TV.

**Nature Girl Kacey. Field: No Field**
- Krabby, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Binacle, Lv. 44, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Once you win, return to the girl who requested it to get *Department Store Sticker: Meditite*.

!shop("Department Store 6F (Left)", ["Kebia Berry", "Shuca Berry", "Coba Berry", "Haban Berry", "Kasib Berry", "Colbur Berry", "Babiri Berry", "Chilan Berry", "Roseli Berry"])

!shop("Department Store 6F (Right)", ["Occa Berry", "Passho Berry", "Wacan Berry", "Rindo Berry", "Yache Berry", "Payapa Berry", "Tanga Berry", "Charti Berry", "Chople Berry"])

The type berries are all pretty useful when you need them, but I would recommend only stocking up when you know you need some because of the price.

Anyways, back in Apophyll, we are next going to explore the optional area Apophyll Cave at the very top-left corner of the beach.

## Apophyll Cave

**Apophyll Cave 1F**

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |

|**Stunfisk**      |7  |                  |   |

We will eventually be able to trade Stunfisk later on, so get one if you can.

The NPC in the top right will do an in-game trade: your Ledian for his **Shieldon**.

**Apophyll Cave 2F**

|Cave              |%  |Rock Smash        |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Crabrawler        |25 |Geodude           |60 |
|**Dwebble**       |24 |Nosepass          |40 |

On the second floor you can find in item balls *Exp. Candy L*, *Water Stone*, and *Zoom Lens*, while hidden items include *Red Shard*, *Ether*, *Potion*, *Paralyze Heal*, and *Burn Heal*.

## Pyrous Mountain

Now we can continue with the story. Head into the meditation area to the south of the academy and talk to the pink haired lady.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Kiki you are a new student (+1 Cal, +1 Victoria)

Head into the back room of the academy and talk to Kiki again. She will tell us that we have to battle Victoria or we have to battle Cal. We actually can do both of them, so I will cover both fights. If you feel like skipping one of them, you can.

To fight Victoria, head into the courtyard of the academy.

**Apprentice Victoria (2x Choc Ice Cream). Field: Ashen Beach**
- Pangoro, Lv. 38, @Shell Bell, Ability: Iron Fist, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Bullet Punch
    - Payback
    - Strength
    - Circle Throw
- Mienfoo, Lv. 38, @Muscle Band, Ability: Regenerator, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Drain Punch
    - Fake Out
    - Meditate
    - Rock Tomb
- Raichu-Alola, Lv. 39, Ability: Surge Surfer, IVs: 30
    - Hidden Power
    - Nasty Plot
    - Psychic
    - Thunderbolt
- Gallade, Lv. 40, @Shell Bell, Ability: Justified, Adamant Nature, IVs: 30
    - Leaf Blade
    - Night Slash
    - Psycho Cut
    - Swords Dance
- Incineroar, Lv. 41, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Intimidate, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Strength
    - Darkest Lariat
    - Iron Head
    - Fire Fang

Victoria has a tougher team than last time. She picked up a Mienfoo and finally evolved her other four team members, so they can actually deal significant damage now. You'll notice from the field notes that Strength and Meditate are boosted on this field, so watch out for those. With good coverage and/or exploiting the field you can win this battle!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Victoria at Apophyll Academy (+1 Victoria)

Cal is on the top of Pyrous Mountain. We aren't required to go up here yet as you only need to fight one of them, but we will need to climb it eventually, so I do it now. Make your way to the mountain via the bottom left corner of Apophyll Beach.

**Pyrous Mountain B1F / 1F / 2F / 3F**

|Cave                   |%  |
|-----------------------|---|
|Numel                  |25 |
|**Diglett-Alola**      |20 |
|Noibat                 |14 |
|Slugma                 |10 |
|**Sawk**               |10 |
|**Throh**              |10 |
|Graveler               |6  |
|**Dugtrio-Alola**      |4  |
|**Magcargo**           |1  |

You can also find Magcargo by smashing the nearby pillars. Anyways, nothing to do on 1F so go to B1F via the ladder. You'll see a pillar glowing, which means we can drain lava by rock smashing it. Do so, then go down the ladder to the left to B2F.

**Pyrous Mountain B2F**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Slugma            |50 |
|Numel             |50 |

Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and drain the lava. Head up the ladder and immediately come back down. If it is still glowing, you can smash the pillar to get **Turtonator**. This is one of two possibilities of a randomly determined event.

Back on B1F, you'll see that the lava has drained, so go into the empty pool and go down. Head down the ladder here, and you'll find a hidden *Charcoal* and a *Fire Stone*. If you didn't get Turtonator earlier, there will be a **Heatmor** here to catch. Back upstairs, jump down the hole in the floor to get a *Flame Orb* as well as the *Super-Heated Field Readout*.

Head back to 1F, where the lava will now be drained as well. Follow the path up to 3F. A lava pool will force you to the left back to 2F, where you can drain the lava. Take the ladder to 1F then head to the left to drain it again. Finally, return to B1F then B2F to finish draining the lava as we did before.

Make your way back to 3F, then go across the empty pool. On 4F you can find a hidden *X Defend* before exiting to the peak. The peak hides a *Exp. Candy L*.

**Igneous Cal (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Super-Heated Field**
- Barbaracle, Lv. 38, Ability: Tough Claws, Brave Nature, IVs: 20
    - Stealth Rock
    - Slash
    - Scald
    - Rock Slide
- Turtonator, Lv. 38, Ability: Shell Armor, Bashful Nature, IVs: 20
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Flamethrower
    - Head Smash
    - Revenge
- Hakamo-o, Lv. 39, Ability: Soundproof, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sky Uppercut
    - Dual Chop
    - Headbutt
    - Rock Tomb
- Typhlosion, Lv. 40, Ability: Blaze, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Solar Beam
    - Hidden Power
    - Sunny Day
    - Flame Charge
- Charizard, Lv. 39, Ability: Blaze, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Thunder Punch
    - Fire Punch
    - Dragon Claw
    - Wing Attack
- Magmortar, Lv. 41, Ability: Flame Body, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Focus Blast
    - Thunderbolt
    - Solar Beam
    - Lava Plume

Cal now has a full team of six and gets the full benefit of the field. It boosts Scald as well as the Fire moves, and can turn into the Burning Field if Magmortar gets to use Lava Plume. Aside from Scald your own Water types will have a tougher time on this field. Luckily, he still makes some suboptimal moves - his Typhlosion hits hardest with Solar Beam and his Charizard is physical, for example. Past Hakamo-o a Rock type or two can pretty much destroy his whole team.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Cal atop Pyrous Mountain (+2 Cal)

Return to Kiki's room once you're done with your chosen battle(s) and talk to them inside.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Victoria you cannot keep a secret (-1 Victoria)

## VS. The Sensei

To finish off this section, we have to battle Kiki in the main courtyard. Prepare your team because this is a toughie. Make sure to save before, just in case.

**Sensei Kiki (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Ashen Beach**
- Machamp, Lv. 40, @Leftovers, Ability: No Guard, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Strength
    - Meditate
    - Rock Slide
    - Payback

    - Knock Off
    - High Jump Kick

    - Night Slash
    - Strength
    - Poison Jab
    - Rock Slide

    - Aura Sphere

    - Drain Punch
    - Meditate
    - Strength
    - Ice Punch

Man this fight kicks my butt on at least half of my replays. Ashen Beach field has so many little things that help her team of six fully evolved Fighting types that you really have to be on your toes to survive this battle. Her lead either will go straight for a field boosted Strength or will set up +3 Attack on the first turn, so it is hard to immediately get momentum. In the back is Toxicroak who loves setting up and punishing you with Sucker Punch, Hitmonlee, who will outspeed everything thanks to the combo of Normal Gem, Fake Out, and Unburden, Gallade who... is just OK but still strong, Lucario who is the sole special attacker and loves to get a double boost with field-boosted Calm Mind, and Medicham, who hits like a truck and always crits thanks to its seed. Medicham and Lucario also ignore accuracy and evasion with their abilities!

This field can't be changed naturally, but you there are powerful tricks you can use to exploit it. Psychic, Zen Headbutt, and Calm Mind get boosts here, so if you can get around Hitmonlee and Toxicroak's priority/speedy dark moves, a Psychic type can do heavy damage. The Sand and Mud moves also get boosted here as do Muddy Water and Surf, so if you need extra damage, they're great options especially under Rain. Otherwise, it's really all just about countering the priority moves and building momentum. If you're able to bait out Toxicroak's 5 Sucker Punches, you can use those turns to set up a sweeper of your own. Exploit Nature Power too: since it turns into Meditate, it can turn many physical attackers into potential sweepers. This one is hard for me everytime but I always eventually figure it out, so can you!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Kiki on your first try (+1 Victoria)
- Defeat Kiki on the second, third, etc. try (-2 Victoria)
