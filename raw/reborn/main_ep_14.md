# Episode 14: //outlier.corruption

After your gym fight, enter the building in the bottom left side of Calcenon. You'll get *TMX6 Dive* inside! We could have gone in here earlier, but:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Charlotte before getting Dive (+1 Noel, +1 Shelly)

You can also talk to Hardy in here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in the Calcenon house about Charlotte (+1 Hardy)

With that, we now have all we need to Dive! There are a few quick things we can do, however!

## 11 Badge Quests

Enter the gate at the bottom of Calcenon. The guard inside will ask us to donate $40000 to repair the bridge that was broken in the previous chapter. Note that if you don't have enough cash, you'll need to go all the way through Route 4 and Route 3 caves to go between Ametrine Mountain and Calcenon City. Anyways, once you cough up the cash the bridge, will be fixed. Head outside and to the right on the stairs, and enter the cave here.

Inside, you can get an *Electrizer*, *Magmarizer*, and *Ghost Memory*. Re-enter Calcenon City. In the building to the right of the Pokémon Center you can trade this Magmarizer to get a **Magby**! In a building to the right of the gym you can trade the Electrizer for an **Elekid**!

Head down to Route 3 via the new stairs. Down from here, you'll see a ladder. Interact with it to create a quick shortcut that allows us to go from Calcenon to Agate Circus super easily! Head to the circus.

To the right of the high striker you'll see a new vendor. For three Green Shards you can do another puzzle! This is in fact a [Fifteen Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). When you finish, it will look like this:

!img("turtwig.jpg")

For winning you'll get a **Turtwig!**

Talk to the person in the top right guarding the Ferris Wheel to get the *Fighting Memory*.

## Mountain Range Divin'

Next, I will return to the Celestinine Cascade. If you've yet to put the Crustle we moved to get Salandit back in place, now is a great time to do so.

Enter Celestinine Mountain by surfing up at the cascade.

Go left up the stairs at your first opportunity, and make your way across the ice here such that you can surf at the bottom of this area. Go down at the dive spot here.

Hidden down here, you'll find a hidden *Resist Wing* and a *Red Shard*.

**Celestinine Mountain B1F / B3F / 1F / 2F / Ametrine Mountain B3F / B2F / B1F / 1F / 2F Underwater Tunnels**

|Land              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Clamperl**      |45 |
|Chinchou          |30 |
|**Lanturn**       |15 |
|**Relicanth**     |10 |

Emerge at the other dive spot. You can find a hidden *PokéSnax* as well as *TM82 Dragon Tail* and an *Exp. Candy XL*. Make your way back to the previous dive spot. Next, go up and right to head to Celestinine Mountain 2F and make your way to the large body of water. Dive down at the crescent-shaped spot.

To the right, you'll find the *Snowy Mountain Field Readout*. Up and to the right you'll find a *Water Stone*. Emerge at the dive spot in the upper right side. Up here you'll find the *PULSE Readout 2*. Oh dear.

Make your way back to the crescent dive spot. Head up to reach Ametrine Mountain 2F. Northeast of the iceberg, you'll find a dive spot.

Follow the path, diving up and down as you go. Once you pop up inside the iceberg, you'll find another PULSE!

**Pokémon Redoubt. Field: Icy Field**
- PULSE Avalugg, Lv. 70, @Leftovers, Ability: Solid Rock, Brave Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/0/252/0/4/0.
    - Hammer Arm
    - Earthquake
    - Recover
    - Avalanche

With 255 in Def and SpD, a respectable HP, Leftovers and Recover, this thing is tanky! It also has a great attack stat and can hit hard with field boosted Avalanche as well as Hammer Arm and Earthquake for coverage. Earthquake also has the side effect of laying spikes on your side. There are a number of strategies that make this doable - it is a 6v1 after all, so it can't shake off stat debuffs. Toxic, Protect, and a healing move on a physically defensive Pokémon alone can pretty much win this fight. Heal Block, Knock Off, or Taunt can help with the recovery problem, Intimidate or other Atk debuffs can help neutralize its power, Counter or Metal Burst can ignore its high Def, etc.

With that out of the way, head up the now-open ladder up to Ametrine Mountain 3F. Up here you can get a hidden *Green Shard*, *X Attack*, and *Blue Shard*. On the next floor, you'll find a hidden *Ice Gem*. By going to the bottom left corner then alternating between going right and up/down, make your way to the door on the middle of the right side of the ice puzzle and exit.

## Ametrine City

Hidden here you'll find a *Purple Shard*, *Resist Wing*, *X Attack*, and *Ether* until you come upon the first fork. To the right along a narrow cliffside, you can find hidden *PokéSnax* and *Blue Shard*. Double back and go left. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Potion*, and *Zinc* as you proceed. Talk to Shelly here.

Enter the small building nearby. Inside, talk to the old man to begin a quest. You can also talk to his computer to get the *Glitch Field Readout*.

Head west at the next fork. You can get a hidden *Ether* around here. In the first house, you can bring a Rotom to the computer to change its form! Enter the tall building next. On the second floor, trade away your Pidove to a kid to get an *Old Amber*. Sweet. Head back outside and go to the left. You'll see a Lucario on a building, who will then run off. Follow it all the way right to the narrow cliffside, and it will run off with its egg.

Back at the main village fork, go down. In the south side of the city you can pick up hidden *Stardust*, *Big Pearl*, *Repel*, *Chewing Gum*, *Green Shard*, *Red Shard*, *X Sp. Atk*, *Full Heal*, *Tiny Mushroom*, and *Antidote*. Make sure you save this (or any) Tiny Mushroom for a quest later.

In the house next to the Pokémon Center, talk to the guy to learn of a glitch in his computer. Talk to the machine for a short battle gauntlet!

These battles aren't particularly tough, but it is our first real exposure to fighting on the glitch field, so try to get used to its quirks here. For winning, you'll obtain the *Department Store Sticker: Porygon-Z*.

Talk to the people around the ice rink to progress the story.Next, enter the building above the ice rink. You'll get the *Battle Pass - Gravity*. Can't use it quite yet though. Back outside, talk to Shelly. While we're here, navigate through the ice rink and the child obstacles to reach the exit at the bottom. Follow it to get *TM95 Snarl*.

From here, head up to the now-open apartment at the center of town. Go to the top floor and talk to Shelly.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to refuse Blake all three times.**

- Refuse Blake twice, then give him the ring (+2 Blake, -2 Cal, -1 Shelly, -1 Heather)
- Refuse Blake all three times. (Anna +1, Shade +1, Cal +2, -2 Shelly, -2 Blake, -1 Heather)

If you gave Blake the ring, you'll get *TMX5 Waterfall.* If you didn't, you'll need to head outside to talk to Cal, then come back in to Blake's apartment.

Now we have to search Blake's room for clues to make a way out.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Check under Blake's bed (-1 Blake)

Under the left couch you'll find *3 Coins*, while the chair towards the bottom contains *1 Coin* and the bottom right sofa contains *2 Coins*. In the trash can at the top you'll find the head of a key. The game console contains a Program Disc. The drawer at the bottom contains a key handle, so you can open the cabinet at the top to get a power cable. Use the cable and the disc on the computer to open a prompt for a password. To get the password, search all the books and flowers around the room and talk to Shelly a few times! Input the code once you have it:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    5083164
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the code</a>
</div>

Enter the secret passage and follow the path! On 6F you can find a hidden *Iron*.

Head outside and pick up the hidden *Flying Gem*. Talk to Shelly here. Once you have freed Heather, head into the shack and talk to the machine to get the *Flying Memory*!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Free Heather after refusing to give Blake the ring (+1 Heather)

Make your way back to the main part of Ametrine City and go all the way left. You'll have to defeat a few Meteor Grunts, with either Shelly or Cal as a partner depending on your choices.

It can sweep you if you're not prepared, but you can handle this surely. Once you win, head into the cave to get a *Fairy Memory* and an egg that will hatch into **Riolu**.

Head into the cave entrance back on the main path.

### Refused Blake Route: Aster Fight

If you gave Blake the ring, skip ahead to the next section.

Due to our actions we still don't have Waterfall, but there's an extra fight to compensate!

    - Throat Chop
    - Swords Dance

Aster is back, this time completely alone. He has a generally fast and frail physical team, so try to exploit the Icy Field or just overwhelm him with a better singles team.

Winning will finally net you *TMX5 Waterfall*.

### The Battle Atop Ametrine

Inside this cave you can get a hidden *PP Up* and an *Ultra Potion* upstairs.

Emerge into the outside once more, pick up the *Common Candy* and *Shoal Shell*, then prepare for a fight at the top.

    - Iron Head

Blake has a pretty tough doubles team that takes advantage of the power of Water and Ice types, but mainly from the physical side. Intimidate Gyarados is good as usual, and paired with Snow Cloak Mamoswine, it can crush your Pokémon that aren't as defensively blessed. In the back he has the speedy combo of Weavile, Starmie, and Slush Rush Sandslash, plus has a bulky Walrein with an extra 1.5x boost to defense thanks to natural hail. On top of that, the field boosts all of his Ice type attacks as well as Rock Slide, plus makes Thunder perfectly accurate. All in all this is a tough fight but not unbeatable!

There are lots of Snowy Mountain Field interactions you can exploit if you want. For example, you too can harness perfectly accurate Thunder to easily dispatch Gyarados and Starmie. This field may help out Ice types but arguably it can help Flying types even more: Flying attacks are boosted by 1.5x here and Tailwind grants Strong Winds, allowing your Flying types to ignore their Ice weaknesses and granting another 1.5x boost to flying moves! There are also a ton of boosted attacks and abilities on this field - a shoutout to Aurorus, who gets 1.5x for Refrigerate, AND 1.5x for Hyper Voice being boosted, AND 1.5x for Ice type moves being boosted on this field! You can also turn it to mountain with a burning move to cancel out the Ice type bonus on Rock type moves, too! Otherwise, I'll sound like a broken record here - it's a doubles fight, so you'll get mileage out of Wide Guard, Trick Room, Protect, and other similar strategies.

Once you win, Blake will fail!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- If Saphira was abducted earlier, Cal tells you about Terra and Lin in depth (+1 Terra)

Cal will offer you a ride back to the main part of Ametrine.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Refuse Cal's offer down the mountain (-1 Cal)

Before we leave Ametrine City, enter the small house just south of Blake's apartment and give the girl inside a Floral Charm in exchange for the *Banettite*! Next, head on over to the Pokémart. Inside, a person will give you a *Magmarizer*.

Before we proceed with the story, we can head over to Calcenon via the Route 3 shortcut to get the following points:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Cain in Calcenon after fighting Blake (+1 Cain)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Hardy in Calcenon after fighting Blake (+1 Hardy)

You can also head into Charlotte's gym - if you decided to 'cheat' and open the secret door earlier, you can now follow the path to get the *Charizardite X*.

Enter the house to the left of the gym if you refused to give Blake the Ruby Ring. Exit and come back in. Inside the bedroom you can get the *Shiny Charm*! If not, you'll be able to get it later on.

With that out of the way, return to the Circus.

## Clown Indra Fights 2

By beating Charlotte, we now have access to stronger teams on Clown Indra. Beating him now awards a random shard as before, but also 5 *Exp. Candy XL*.

    - Ice Beam

Bringing Mewtwo back to where it belongs with Glitch Field: completely broken. Of note is its Psystrike, which gets boosted by the field and Mewtwo's high Special Attack yet hits your Pokémon on their Defense. That said, there are still tons of ways to win these 6v1's as we've learned by now, so pick your favorite one.

Proceed and get ready for the gym battle! Note that you can actually exit back to the circus easily in case you want to do more prep.

Time to take on M3G4 T3RR4. As you've probably come to learn by now, the Glitch Field is pretty funky, enough that I'm gonna cover its intricacies with a whole diatribe before we even fight her. There are a few really important things about this field that you need to remember:

1. Type Matchups: all moves of the original physical types will be physical, and all moves of the original special types will be special, so we're back to certain Pokémon being snubbed and others strengthened depending on their movepools. Additionally, Dark, Steel, and Fairy moves will all be retyped as Normal, Dragon always hits neutrally, Bug and Poison hit each other super-effectively, Ice hits Fire neutrally, and Psychic is immune to Ghost. In some cases these changes can be good for you: such as how physical Fighting types now have a stronger option in physical Focus Blast, or how Bug and Poison types are generally better now.
2. Special attack damage: special attacks will be based on the higher stat of your SpA and SpD... an utter game changer, as now Special walls such as Shuckle and Toxapex are able to hit hard! It also means that raising Special Defense will increase both offensive and defensive capabilities - so moves like Cosmic Power, Charge, and Stockpile can lend themselves to creating a 1 Pokémon army if you set up at the right time.
3. Speedy crits: the faster Pokémon on the field always gets a bonus to critical hit chance, so with a Razor Claw held you're getting crits for free 50% of the time, and nearly always with moves like Night Slash! Helpful for ignoring those aforementioned defense boosts.
4. The Synthetic Seed turns a Pokémon into ??? type *with no weaknesses* and raises Defense. There are a few more things you can read about in the field notes like the Psychic move boost, but these are the main things you have to consider.

So, onto how Terra uses this field. You'll get a good example of the second principle right away in her Nidoking, who will get bulkier and *stronger* by using Amnesia. It can then hit hard with extra-accurate Blizzard, Thunderbolt and Flamethrower for wide special coverage. Hippowdon is bulky and likes to put you to sleep and hit with the ol' reliable Rock / Ground offensive combo, but more importantly, it sets up weather for its buddy Sand Rush Excadrill, who gets boosted critical hit rate as long as it's going first. If that wasn't enough she has a mixed Garchomp who gets to ignore the SpA drops of Draco Meteor by calculating special damage based on its SpD stat, but can also hit hard with physical Bulldoze and Stone Edge. Rounding out her team is Palossand and Quagsire, each with the Synthetic Seed, neutralizing their weaknesses entirely and allowing each to set up with Amnesia and Recovery moves. Quagsire even has Unaware to ruin whatever similar SpD stacking strategy you have going! All in all a tough team that may really mess you up if you aren't using the field to maximum effect for your team.

The first thing I recommend for this fight is to literally use a list like [this one](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VII)) to find some Pokémon with really high SpD, since they are generally the best for this field. Even better if they have moves like Amnesia, Stockpile, or Cosmic Power - you can use them to sweep once you get past Quagsire, especially if you decide to give them a Synthetic Seed of their own to avoid super-effective damage taken.  Ice, Water, Grass, and Psychic moves are generally the best choices offensively here - in particular, 90% accurate Blizzard and hits-defense Psyshock are good choices. It's worth noting that Explosion halves enemy defense, which makes it useful as a last-minute nuke against the ??? type tanks or Garchomp. If have a Pokémon with high speed and a move like Leaf Blade, you can also try to go for 100% critical hit chance, which should allow you a much easier time with the members of her team who stack SpD. You can also consider using Roar, Whirlwind, or Dragon Tail on the ??? type Pokémon, since that will wipe away their special typing and defense boost, allowing you to use Grass moves more easily on them.

- Defeat Terra (-4 Terra, actually not a choice)

For winning, you'll get the *Gravity Badge* which lets us actually use Waterfall. We also get *TM78 Bulldoze*! We did it.
