# Postgame Episode 9: Pokémon Reborn, Reborn!

Boom. Level cap has reached its peak at Lv. 150.

## Preparing for the Final Battle

Head into the Nightclub and talk to Aster. All the anomalies have been taken care of! Yay! Head out of the Nightclub, and Heather will tell you to go to the top of the treehouse.

Make your way there, and talk to Noel. We'll need to bring Giratina to the meteor, and Fern to the tree. First, add Giratina to your party, then make your way via Beryl Cave to Citae Prisma. Talk to the meteor to steal it.

Next, slog through Tanzan Mountain to reach the Neoteric Isle once more. Talk to Florinia and Fern in the back room when you're ready.

    - Leaf Storm
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Giga Drain

One more bout with our friend, Fern. No Mega Scizor this time - it's Mega Mawile, instead. Entei's Extremespeed and Mawile's Sucker Punch are potent anti-sweep options, while his Serperior and Kartana both attempt to sweep themselves. Everything here is weak to Fire, Ground, or both, so if you're stuck, orienting your team around moves of those types might be key. I'm sure you can figure out a way through this fight so far into this game.

Accept the fast travel back to the Nightclub. Make your way up to the top of the Rhodochrine Tree and talk to Noel. Once the door opens, talk to Fern for a heal and 100 *Exp. Candy XL*. Head on in when you're ready.

## New World Asylum

This area will be different, depending if you're on Lin or Anna Route. Throughout the area, enter the jail cells and talk to the inhabitants inside. Climb the gold chains to reach the sides. Each Key will open one of the locks at the bottom.

On Lin Route, buy some *Lemonade* or get some free *Honey* if you want.

Anyways, once you've explored the area, prepare for what's to come at the top...

A THREE FIGHT GAUNTLET AGAINST ALL PULSE2 WITH NO HEALING SO ITS EFFECTIVELY 18V6 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

### Final Gauntlet (Lin Route)

**Anamnestic Terra. Field: Big Top Arena**

    - Close Combat
    - Nature Power
    - Horn Leech
    - Moonblast

The gauntlet's structure being as it is basically means one thing - you HAVE TO SET UP SWEEP. There really isn't another option. Thankfully, in this first fight, only Lycanroc has priority, so Evoboost, Shell Smash, etc. are valid options that should be able to carry you through this one.

**Mordant Urchin Lin. Field: New World**
- Necrozma-Dusk, Lv. 150, @Leftovers, Ability: Prism Armor, Brave Nature, IVs: 31 (0 Speed), EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/0

    - Crunch
    - Ancient Power
    - Earth Power
    - Superpower
- Volcanion, Lv. 150, @Choice Specs, Ability: Water Absorb, Sassy Nature, IVs: 31 (0 Speed), EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/0
    - Steam Eruption
    - Fire Blast
    - Earth Power
    - Flash Cannon
- Lunala, Lv. 150, @Leftovers, Ability: Shadow Shield, Sassy Nature, IVs: 31 (0 Speed), EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/0
    - Trick Room
    - Moongeist Beam
    - Moonblast
    - Roost

This second fight is in doubles, and the whole team is slow. Necrozma and Lunala each have Trick Room and will try to set it up - so making sure you have Taunt is pretty essential for this one. Everything is weak to Ground or Dark, so with field boosted Earth Power, Dark type moves, and maybe a Z-move in a pinch, you should then be able to find a combination of sweepers that is able to take this team out.

**Anomaly Arceus. Field: New World**
- Tornadus-Therian, Lv. 150, @Focus Sash, Ability: Regenerator, Hasty Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Tailwind

    - Sacred Fire
    - U-turn
    - Defog
    - Brave Bird
- Rayquaza, Lv. 150, @Magical Seed, Ability: Air Lock, Hasty Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Dragon Ascent
    - Extreme Speed
    - Ancient Power
    - Earth Power

    - Sucker Punch
    - Oblivion Wing
    - U-turn
    - Heat Wave
- Cresselia, Lv. 150, @Focus Sash, Ability: Levitate, Hardy Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Lunar Dance
    - Lunar Dance
    - Lunar Dance
    - Lunar Dance
- PULSE Arceus, Lv. 150, @Magical Seed, Ability: Multitype, Calm Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Judgment
    - Spacial Rend
    - Psyshock
    - Moonlight

Finally, the big one. Tornadus has a nasty habit of U-Turning into Rayquaza, who will instantly get the seed effect and Mega Evolve. We don't want that, so either anticipate the U-Turn with your lead and use an Ice or Fairy type move to oneshot Rayquaza, or do something to prevent Tornadus from living long enough to U-Turn. Yveltal has a Z-move and Sucker Punch, both of which get massive boosts in power, so you'll need to make sure you have a Pokémon that can outplay it here. Ho-oh is pretty chill comparably, though its Sacred Fire is boosted too.

Tornadus and Cresselia both have Sashes - the latter will always use Lunar Dance to give Arceus an extra omniboost on top of the seed it already has. Again, a twice omniboosted Arceus is absolutely brutal to take out - so I recommend hazards like Stealth Rocks to break Cresselia's sash and hopefully one shot it. Pretty much no matter what, you'll need a massively boosted sweeper in order to win this one, so take advantage of the fact Arceus has to recharge for a turn to hit it with two well chosen +6 Field boosted moves if you can, and hopefully that will be enough. Good luck!

Once you finally make it through all that, you'll be able to talk to Lin, hanging on the edge, or Arceus.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Arceus before Lin (-3 Terra)

In either case, you can now catch **Arceus**, finally.

Talk to Lin, either letting her come with you, or not. Exit the area!

### Final Gauntlet (Anna Route)

**Anamnestic Shade. Field: Glitch Field**
- Lugia, Lv. 150, @Assault Vest, Ability: Multiscale, Calm Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252

    - Hidden Power
- Giratina-Altered, Lv. 150, @Assault Vest, Ability: Pressure, Careful Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Draco Meteor
    - Psychic
    - Shadow Sneak
    - Aqua Tail
- Mimikyu, Lv. 150, @Assault Vest, Ability: Disguise, Careful Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Shadow Sneak
    - Giga Drain
    - Psychic
    - Thunderbolt
- Gengar, Lv. 150, @Gengarite, Ability: Cursed Body, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Giga Drain
    - Ice Punch
    - Fire Punch
    - Psychic
- Aegislash, Lv. 150, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: Stance Change, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Sacred Sword
    - King's Shield
    - Swords Dance
    - Giga Impact

Arguably harder than the Lin Gauntlet, Anna's gauntlet is three fights that all take place on (with a sick looking backdrop) the Glitch Field. This first fight is notably hard thanks to the lead being Lugia, who is able to nuke almost everything with Psyshock, heal with Giga Drain, and use other coverage moves. Mimikyu's Disguise and Shadow Sneak make it hard to set up a fast frail sweeper. With Four Assault Vests, you're going to have a hard time breaking them Specially without a lot of set up. Then there are four other Pokémon pretty much optimized for Glitch Field. In this fight, and frankly the rest of them, I recommend abusing the Synthetic Seed yourself, and going all out with a move like Stockpile or Cosmic Power.

**Dreamsick Anna. Field: Glitch Field**

    - Core Enforcer
    - Extreme Speed
    - Brick Break
- Gallade, Lv. 150, @Galladite, Ability: Steadfast, Jolly Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252

    - Wish
    - Cosmic Power
    - Draco Meteor
    - Protect

Advice from the last fight generally holds here, but you'll need to be extra careful of Xurkitree, who can counter your set up with it's own, as well as paralyze you. Thankfully, you'll probably have a bit more success on this one with a Special sweeper. Watch out for the hazards and status conditions of this team, and make sure Jirachi doesn't snowball too much.

**Anomaly Arceus. Field: Glitch Field**
- Jirachi, Lv. 150, @Leftovers, Ability: Serene Grace, Calm Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Stealth Rock
    - Thunder
    - Zen Headbutt
    - Cosmic Power

    - Moongeist Beam
    - Outrage
    - Photon Geyser
    - Moonlight
- PULSE Arceus, Lv. 150, @Synthetic Seed, Ability: Multitype, Calm Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/252/252/252/252
    - Roar of Time
    - Blizzard
    - Overheat
    - Moonlight

One more fight, and as you can tell, this one isn't easy, either. Again you'll need some way to use only 1 or 2 of your Pokémon to snowball into a sweep. The big problem here is that PULSE Arceus can heal itself as well as ignore the downsides of Roar of Time and Overheat, and becomes ??? type to negate its weaknesses. You can't easily muscle your way around it, and even a +6 boosted Pokémon might not be able to take it out in one hit. At least you can look at this fight and the previous two for team member inspirations... I guess. Good luck!

Once you're done, you'll be immediately thrust into battle with **Arceus**, who you can finally catch.

## Epilogue

Reborn's credits will then play! Lin or Anna will interject with some comments as the credits roll. Interrupting the credits are character endings, corresponding to the characters for which you have an adequate amount of relationship points!

See if you can spot me in the credits.

With that taken care of, you'll get to play out the section in "Another Time" - Agate City of the future. Feel free to talk to the people here to learn how they grew over the years, then talk to Shelly to return to the present.

Congratulations!

## Bee's Pokédex Completion Quest (Part 4)

With Arceus bagged, we have all 807 Pokémon. Fly over to Agate City and talk to Bee if you've caught 'em all. You'll get the *Game Certificate*, as well as the *Ebony Stonepiece*.

Remember the Arc underneath the Grand Stairway? Make your way there via the room where we met Solaris so long ago. Make your way through the arc as we did after beating the Elite Four. Use the stonepiece on the door and head in to watch a scene. Nice.

## The Developer Room

If this is the kind of thing that would interest you, enter the developer's room by talking to Ame's computer in the Grand Hall Basement. I'll leave talking to and fighting the developers an exercise to the reader :)
