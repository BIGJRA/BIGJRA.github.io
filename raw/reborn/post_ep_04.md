# Postgame Episode 4: Across Space & Time

Back in the Nightclub, we can pick from a large number of quests.

## Twilight Desert (Part 1)

First, talk to Marcello on the left for a new quest. He'll also sell us some Lemonade!

**Marcello's Lemonade Shop (Nightclub)**

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Lemonade*             |$350       |
|*Blue Moon Lemonade*   |$100000000 |

We actually can't progress to the end of postgame without buying a Blue Moon.... just kidding. But I bet I got some of you!

Make your way to the Grandview Station, then head to the desert. As soon as you get off the train, go up a few tiles from the train station then go straight to the right. You'll find a New World Door!

**Twilight Desert**

|Cave               |%  |
|-------------------|---|
|Mandibuzz          |20 |
|Marowak            |20 |
|Magneton           |10 |
|Golem              |10 |
|Lunatone           |10 |
|Rampardos          |10 |
|**Stakataka**      |5  |
|Aerodactyl         |5  |
|Mawile             |4  |
|Dhelmise           |4  |
|Weavile            |1  |
|Umbreon            |1  |

This map actually loops back onto itself from its west and east ends, so is a bit tricky to navigate. Hope you like Zygarde Cells, by the way. If you don't care about collecting them, you can just go straight up in this area.

Start by going straight to the left, hugging the bottom wall. You'll eventually find:

**ZCell 05: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_05.jpg")

Make your way back to the entrance area, and go up into the next horizontal section. Go right, then down and left to reach:

**ZCell 06: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_06.jpg")

Make your way back to the "middle" of the map, and go up into the next horizontal section once more. To your right is a narrow pathway, but it leads to a dead end. Instead, go slightly up and follow the path left. You'll see two cells we can't get quite yet - keep following the path left for now. Eventually, you'll reach:

**ZCell 07: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_07.jpg")

Backtrack all the way to the previous fork, this time, going up to the next horizontal section. Left from here, you'll find:

**ZCell 08: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_08.jpg")

Next, go straight to the right, and follow the twisting path to the right. You'll eventually reach the other cell we saw earlier:

**ZCell 09: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_09.jpg")

Head all the way back to the fork. Hopefully we're starting to understand how this area works! At this next fork, go left until you reach:

**ZCell 10: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_10.jpg")

As you might expect, going right at the fork will lead you to:

**ZCell 11: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_11.jpg")

Back at the fork, climb the first set of dunes to go up a tier, but don't climb up the second quite yet. Follow the narrow path to the right to:

**ZCell 12: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_12.jpg")

Back at the fork, climb the final set of dunes. Going up from here, you'll see a large structure. Start by going to the left. You'll see a lever at the top of some stairs - pull it. Head left from here, and you'll find:

**ZCell 13: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_13.jpg")

From here, continue going around the loop until you see an open door up some stairs. Head in. Inside, you'll find two screens. Talk to each screen, then head back out.

Go left from here, and you'll find a path up that leads to another lever and a door. The door is currently a dead end, so pull the lever, then left once more. Pull the first lever that we saw once more, then go left again. Enter the now-open door that you'll see. Talk to the machine to get:

**ZCell 14: Twilight Desert**

!img("zcell_14.jpg")

Talk to the machine on the right, and you'll be able to merge ten of the cells we've found so far into **Zygarde 10%**. You can deconstruct this Zygarde, if you want.

Head outside, and go to the right. Past the first lever, there will be a new opened door. One of the monitors in here will give you as many Zygarde Cells as you've found so far in *Cell Imprints*, the game's ONLY way of increasing IV's on our Pokemon. As you might guess, the Cells are limited in total number, so be sure when you use these on your Pokemon. You can come back here anytime to get more as you get more Cells. Anyways, talk to the other machine then head back outside.

From here, go right, then up. The gate inside is now gone, so you can head up. Talk to Florinia.

That's all we have to do here for now. If you redo the first lever on the outside, the stairs to the left that lead into a room we previously checked out will reappear, and inside you can actually trade  Cell Imprints for *Negative Imprints*, which instead turn an IV to 0. Helpful for maximizing a Trick Room user's effectiveness. Given the limited number of these in the game, I don't recommend using them for lowering Atk, since the confusion damage is negligible at best.

Anyways, that's all for this area for a while. Feel free to return for more Cell and Negative Imprints. Return to the Nightclub!

## Anomaly at Chrysolia Springs

Talk to your gang leader on the right side, and they'll tell you about something going down at the Chrysolia Springs. Head over to Spinel Town, make your way into the forest, then enter the Springs on the left side.

Surf across, push the boulder out of the way, then jump down to the basement floor. Head up once you're ready!

    - Dragon Pulse
    - Thunderbolt

Another anomaly fight. If you could make it here, I'm sure this one won't be too intense. Field boosted Steam Eruption, Heat Wave, Surf, etc. can all be potentially deadly, but surely you can find a way to gain momentum and win this one.

After winning, you'll be able to fight **Volcanion**. Exit and return to the Nightclub once you're done.

## Poachers in the Chrysolia Deepwoods

Next, talk to Smeargle to get a new quest. Head outside and talk to Arclight, then fly over to Spinel Town. Enter the forest and enter the Lost Railcave in the bottom-right corner.

In each room, enter the door that has two rocks closest to it. Eventually you will reach a room containing Arclight. After the conversation, enter the New World Door in the next path.

**New World (Chrysolia Railcave)**

|Land               |%  |
|-------------------|---|
|Golem              |20 |
|Raichu             |20 |
|Luxray             |10 |
|Carbink            |10 |
|Umbreon            |10 |

|Lunatone           |5  |
|Sableye            |5  |
|Minior             |4  |
|Rotom              |4  |
|Shiinotic          |1  |
|**Nihilego**       |1  |

Make your way to the top right side of the area. You'll be able to sneak down to the upper path, follow this all the way around to the bottom left side to reach:

**ZCell 15: New World (Chrysolia Railcave)**

!img("zcell_15.jpg")

Back in the main area, interact with the tall pillar at the top of the hill to create some electric platforms at the bottom right. The path from here is straightforward... and if you're on Lin Route, you'll even get taunted as you activate the pillars.

One of the islands towards the bottom has a *Max Repel* on it. Eventually you'll have to backtrack to reach the next set of electric platforms, proceed to the left once you backtrack enough.

On Lin Route, you'll be given a prompt to release some of your Pokemon. This event is huge and branching... but aside from tons of great dialogue, the only thing that 'matters' aside from your morals is that if you release a lot of Pokemon, you'll get a *Sacred Ash*. You can back out of the PC a bunch of times if you don't want to release anything.

Once the pillar is activated, cross the bridge to the right, then again to a new landmass. In the top right, corner, you can find:

**ZCell 16: New World (Chrysolia Railcave)**

!img("zcell_16.jpg")

Enter the New World Door at the bottom to return to the Chrysolia Deepwoods. Talk to Arclight here, then make your way through the Deepwoods to defeat the poachers. Arclight will heal you, if you need it. The first is up from Arclight:

Nothing too crazy here, though there is a good mix of fast and slow, bulky and hard-hitting. Once you win, talk to **Zeraora** to obtain it! Accept the fast travel back to the Nightclub.

## Aegir Cave

Talk to Randall in the Nightclub, and accept his quest. Fly over to the Victory Road Pokemon Center.

Enter Victory Road, then follow Victini up. Enter the room directly up, and follow Bennett into the next room... I audibly gasped when I saw what was next.

Another LOGIC PUZZLE! As always, I will recommend using the <a href="resources\vr_logic_puzzle_sheets.xlsx">spreadsheet</a>.

The clues:

1. No two crystals share any same quality.
2. The Purity of the 'Coxcomb' gem is less than the Purity of the 'Miniscule' gem, which is less than the Purity of the 'Vitreous' gem.
3. The Hardness of the 'Eminent' gem is less than the Hardness of the 'Perfect' gem, which is less than the Hardness of the 'Cubic' gem.
4. The Purity of the gem with a Hardness of 5 is less than the Purity of the gem with 'Perfect' Foliation, which is less than the Purity of the 'Pearly' gem.
5. The Luster of the 'Tabular' gem is less than the luster of the 'Cubic' gem, which is less than the Luster of the gem with 'Indistinct' Foliation.
6. The Size of the 'Coxcomb' gem is less than the Size of the 'Indistinct' gem, which is less than the Size of the gem with a Hardness of 8.
7. The Foliation of the 'Hexagonal' gem is less than the Foliation of the 'Large' gem, which is less than the Foliation of the gem with a Hardness of 7.
8. The Habit of the 'Flawless' gem is less than the Habit of the 'Pearly' gem, which is less than the Habit of the 'Silky' gem.

You'll also notice that there are rocks on some of the tracks for the gems: this provides us more information for our puzzle. I have blocked out the corresponding spaces in the spreadsheet.

The solution:

!img("vr_puzzle_5.jpg")

Bennett will just do it for you if you fail too many times.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Solve Logic Puzzle 5 in five or fewer tries (+1 Bennett)

Once you succeed, head up. Grab the hidden *Exp. Candy XL* and proceed. Enter the New World Door.

|Masquerain         |5  |                   |   |                   |   |

Head to the left and talk to Bennett and Serra. Bennett will ask us to gather 7 ingredients: Sweet Apple, Tart Apple, Balm Mushroom, Pecha Berry, Berry Juice, Stick, and Rage Powder. He'll also offer to teach Headbutt to one of our Pokemon, if we need it.

Time to wander around the area looking for these things. On this floor you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Nest Ball*, and *Ability Capsule*. Start by jumping into the hole towards the left side, down a muddy slope. On this bottom level, you can talk to a tree to get the *Sweet Apple*.

Jump down the muddy slope to the left. Towards the top of this area, hop across the pillars to get a hidden *Blue Shard*, *Stardust*, and *Full Heal*. You can also grab the *Tart Apple* in a nearby tree. Backtrack, and go down to find a hidden *Ultra Ball*. Going to the right will lead us to red trees where we can grab some *Rage Powder*. Climb the ladder to the left.

Back on the upper level, you can find a hidden *Pecha Berry* in a rock. You can also steal them from wild Wurmple if you lose this one, somehow. On the bottom right of this area are some pillars, leading to a hidden *Dusk Ball* as well as:

**ZCell 17: Aegir Cave**

!img("zcell_17.jpg")

Return to the bottom floor and take the ladder up, in the top left. Make your way back to Bennett, then jump in the hole above him. Grab the hidden *Ultra Ball*, then climb down the rocks and get onto the water. Grab the hidden *Nugget* below the pillars, as well as:

**ZCell 18: Aegir Cave**

!img("zcell_18.jpg")

Return to the upper level. All the way in the bottom right corner, you can jump across a stone and into a hole. Climb the waterfall to reach:

**ZCell 19: Aegir Cave**

!img("zcell_19.jpg")

Head back down and dive.

**Aegir Cave Underwater**

|Land               |%  |
|-------------------|---|
|Lanturn            |30 |
|Seaking            |20 |
|Golisopod          |20 |
|Corsola            |18 |
|Relicanth          |12 |

You'll find a hidden *Max Repel*, *Super Potion*, and *Net Ball* down here. Surface at the end, grabbing the hidden *Berry Juice* in this room. You can steal these from wild Shuckle if you lose this one.

Exit from here at the bottom, grab the hidden *Dusk Ball*, and hop down onto the lake. Pick up the *Ultra Ball* in the middle of the lake, then climb the waterfall at the top of the area. Inside the cave is a *Balm Mushroom*.

Back down on the large lake, dive down. You'll be able to find a hidden *Blue Shard*, *Rawst Berry*, *Exp. Candy XL*, and *Elixir*. Enter the cave here to find:

**ZCell 20: Aegir Cave**

!img("zcell_20.jpg")

Talk to Serra near the bottom of the lake, then head right and climb the ladder. Back on the upper level, go to the top right corner and use the ladder here to reach a *Stick*. That's all the ingredients, so return to Bennett. Once you're ready, talk to **Victini** for a battle!

Agree to walk back with them.

## The Agate Circus Ferris Wheel

Talk to Cass in the Nightclub, then fly over to the Agate Circus. The Ferris Wheel area is finally open, so make your way there.

Grab the hidden *Beast Ball* to the left.

**Agate Circus Ferris Wheel Shop**

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Beast Ball*           |$9000      |

You can buy a couple more of these to make bagging the Ultra Beasts easier, if you want.

Once the crowd clears, you can pick up a hidden *Full Restore* and *Purple Shard*. Talk to the ringmaster to get signed up for the tournament, then talk to the clowns when you're ready. It's a 3v3 tournament on random fields.

    - Surf
    - Shadow Ball

Nothing crazy here, just be careful of the Kommo-o sweep.

The hidden *Max Revive* will be accessible after this one. Talk to the Ringmaster to get the next pairings.

**Cheer Captain Julia. Field: Random Field**
- Galvantula, Lv. 120, @Life Orb, Ability: Compound Eyes, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 0/0/4/252/0/252

    - Volt Switch
    - Dragon Pulse
    - Power Gem
    - Thunder

Especially with a non-electric Field Effect, shouldn't be too hard.

The third pairing:

**BreloomBot CL:4R1-C3. Field: Random Field**
- Magnezone, Lv. 120, @Choice Specs, Ability: Magnet Pull, Timid Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 0/0/4/252/0/252

    - Spore
    - Magnet Bomb
    - Shadow Punch
    - Shift Gear

This one is surprisingly tough. Even with a field effect that is beneficial, you still have to contend with the raw power of Magnezone, easy boosting potential of Magearna, and especially the absolute unit that is CL:4R1-C3 Breloom. Consider setting up on Magnezone somehow in order to oneshot the latter two. You can always save and reset for a more beneficial field, in a pinch.

    - Sparkling Aria
    - Moonblast
    - Sing
    - Ice Beam

Shouldn't be too ridiculous as long as you're aware of the horrors these three are capable of.

Finally, the last match is with Cass. If we pet Glaceon way back in the glass workstation, we will get to fight the first team:

**Friendly Local Cass. Field: Random Field**

Nothing too impossible here. If we didn't pet Glaceon, however.......

Another 12v6. Oh boy. Although the field is random, there is a good chance that one of the Malamars will try to use Topsy-Turvy, transforming the field into Inverse Field. Just like on New World, that will activate all of the Magical Seeds, turning them into omniboosts. On top of the fact that they have lots of coverage in the types made extra good on this field - Ice, Bug, etc., means you'll be taking a lot of damage real fast. Either you can try to roll with this field, bringing moves that will be able to hit super effectively on Inverse, or you can suppress it by knocking out both Malamar's before it's too late. This can be especially beneficial if you end up on a field effect that your team likes and you want to preserve it. Otherwise, standard doubles strategies you've surely had to learn by now will hopefully net you the win eventually.

Head back to the Nightclub!

## What Lies Past Manyworld Forest

Next, we're going to talk to Simon. He'll tell us about something happening in Agate City, so fly on over there. Dive down to reach the area where Lin got her Relic Stone, then enter the New World Door.

This map is huge but mostly empty. Make your way to the bottom left corner to find:

**ZCell 22: Manyworld Forest**

!img("zcell_22.jpg")

Towards the top of the area, you'll be able to hop across some space platforms. In the center only on Anna Route, you'll find a *Fresh Water*. Don't waste it. Go to the left to find:

**ZCell 23: Manyworld Forest**

!img("zcell_23.jpg")

Down from here, you can hop across some platforms to grab the *Tapunium-Z*. Back up from here, you'll occasionally see a moving platform. Use it to reach a *Sacred Ash* at the top. Go back to the center.

Going as far to the right as possible, you'll be able to ride another moving platform to reach:

**ZCell 24: Manyworld Forest**

!img("zcell_24.jpg")

Back in the middle, go up. On Lin Route, now you'll get a *Fresh Water*. Pour the Fresh Water onto the Celebi.

Climb through the New World Door to emerge next to the Pokemon League. If Taka is currently alive for you, he'll be here, otherwise it will be Elias. Whomever is here will give you another *Fresh Water*. Prepare your best team, stock up on healing items, etc. as if you were locking yourself into an Elite Four challenge. Hint: we basically are. Don't be afraid to eat a loss and change up your team if one of the following battles is too much for now.

Give the Fresh Water to Celebi. In the past, talk to Taube at the top for a battle.

A bunch of illegal Celebi on the most broken field in the game. Joy. Plus, the first Celebi in particular is extremely annoying, with speedy Spore and moves to boost and grow the field. That said, you still are facing six Pokemon with the exact same weaknesses, including a double weakness to Bug. A Chesto Berry to deal with Spore, a speed boosting move, and a strong Bug type move like TM X-Scissor are pretty much all you'll need!

Talk to Celebi to jump into the future.

Very similar to Heather's Elite Four battle, Elena also uses the Mountain Field and Tailwind to set up Strong Winds, neutralizing Flying's weaknesses. Dragonite likes to set screens - on top of Multiscale, this makes it annoyingly tanky, so consider Brick Break for this fight. Trick Room is good as usual, and turning the field into a Snowy Mountain can allow you to overpower with Ice moves. Just watch out for Marowak in both cases. Anyways, lots of options to win this one.

Talk to Celebi to proceed to the next area.

I wonder if Amethyst likes Alolan Ninetales? And Fairy and Dark types? Boosted on the Starlight Arena? With the wrinkle of Mega Lopunny to consider, this shouldn't be too insane for anyone who could beat Anna earlier.

Celebi will take you ahead in time once more.

What would be a gauntlet of four trainers without healing or switching your Pokemon without a Champion fight at the end? At this point in the game, her Yanmega, Leavanny, and Primarina are nothing we can't handle. Alolan Muk gets free defenses on this field thanks to its ability, and can boost its Atk and Def further on its free first turn from seed. Then there are the two demons. Mega Scizor is, by now, at least a known demon. It can boost to +3 with Swords Dance then hit like an absolute menace with Bullet Punch. The first time we have to fight a Xerneas is here however... and there's a reason this thing is regarded as so good. If you're not careful it will get +2 in SpA, SpD, and Spe then sweep you with field boosted Moonblast and Secret Sword. Ouch!

A well chosen sweeper can deal with everything barring these two. If you're stuck on them, consider something with a Fire move for Scizor and a physical boosted Steel move for Xerneas. Using Magical Seeds on your own Pokemon will extend the "free turn" effect to them as well, so that may just be the key to overcoming Reborn's future champion.

Talk to Shelly once you're done here. You'll be taken back to your time... and you can talk to **Celebi** to take it with you! Hooray! Return to the Nightclub.

## The Heist on the Train

Next, talk to Zero in the Nightclub and accept his quest. Proceed to Peridot and enter the train station. Talk to Adrienn at the top of the station and state that you're ready to proceed.

After talking to the chief, feel free to talk to the other passengers of the train. Return to the chief. Once the orbs disappear, head to the front of the train. From here, we will talk to all the passengers of the train to try to solve the mystery.

Return to the chief and state that you're done with the investigation when you're ready.

You can now accuse one of the culprits. Each will battle you once accused. You can also talk to the chief multiple times to accuse them. Afterwards, you'll need to check your bag and "Use" the Blue Orb that you find inside to continue.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Accuse Julia of stealing the orbs (-1 Julia)

However, there is one more option: you can check your bag to find the Blue Orb inside *before* making any accusation: this will cause everyone to fight you in a gauntlet, with Anomaly Hoopa as your partner.

Another New World field 12v6. Joy. It's worth noting that Hoopa's team is entirely Trick Room based and slow, while Corin-Rouge's team is a bit speedier altogether. Therefore I recommend either focusing on knocking out Hoopa's team so you can run with the Trick Room yourself, or focusing on knocking out Corin-Rouge first and suppressing/reversing Trick Room whenever possible. By now we also have a lot of legendaries whose signature moves are boosted on this field and Ultra Beasts who can sweep with some momentum, so despite how stacked against you this is, we do have some tools that we can use going forward.

Jump through the portal. You'll find yourself back in the Route 4 New World - follow the path all the way to the portal up top where Corin Rouge is.

You'll next find yourself in the Vanhanen Castle New World - straight up from here is the portal. Follow the path in the New World Route 2 until the fork, then go left. Enter the door to find the next ring.

You'll find yourself now in New World Route 3. Prepare yourself, then make your way to the Keldeo beach fight area. You now get to fight:

    - Dragon Claw
    - Earthquake

PULSE 2 Mega Garchomp, Unaware Quagsire, and tanky Palossand are annoying as always. Ashen Beach providing boosts to Surf, Strength, and Focus Blast doesn't help. But we're a champion of beating numerous 12v6 fights by now - surely this one won't be too intense, right? Enter the next ring and follow the path. LOL!

Back in the train station, talk with the group here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Adrienn you had to bring Terra back (+1 Terra)

You'll also be given **Hoopa**! Walk on back to the nightclub.

## Aiding and Abetting Bladestar?

Finally, talk to Danielle in the Nightclub and accept the quest. Head south from Obsidia Ward into Opal Ward. You'll see a few characters from Rejuvenation as a cameo here!

Anyways, fly over to Agate and make your way to the Glass Workstation. The glass is all gone so you can easily get to the back room. Talk to the girl in here. You can choose which PULSE Machine to go to - once you do, accept the fast travel to where you fought it once upon a time. Check out all the machines that the game expects you to.

Once you emerge in Labradorra, you'll have to fight her.

No "Bewitched Field" nonsense in this game.

Once you win, she'll head to Ametrine City, so follow her and enter the former house of Lumi and Eve. After the conversation, fly on over to the Pokemon League.

I sure hope you like fighting the Elite Four, because we're about to do it again... with Flora as an ally! Each of you will get to use only 3 Pokemon per fight. In general for these fights, it may be smarter to try to support Flora than to try to do your own thing. Keep that in mind as you plan your team of six.

Our first fight against just Laura is mostly the same old shenanigans with the Flower Garden. Flora's team is benefitted by this field just as much as Laura though, so if you can identify the threats to Flora's team and focus on just them, there's a good chance Flora will do the heavy lifting here.

Dragonite likes to absolutely shred Flora's team with Extremespeed, so consider neutralizing it by putting it to sleep, using Reflect, etc. Otherwise it's basically Elias' old team on doubles, so you can find a way through. Dazzling Gleam is a fantastic opening move!

First time we have to fight Bennett solo since he became an Elite Four member, as well. He uses Rainbow Field, where 5 of his Pokemon get a boost to SpA and a Wish with their seeds. There are also tons of boosts to many of his moves. The field's Serene Grace effect also means that there is a high chance that Silver Wind will omniboost - if Pheromosa gets this, it's likely a game over. Flora's team being weak to Bug and Fire doesn't help.

To win, I will once again recommend Trick Room - Volcarona, Delphox, Pheromosa, Ribombee are all fast and frail, so your own slow Pokemon with Flora's Ferrothorn can potentially be key here. Other options exist too, like making it rain and sweeping with Swift Swim users, for example.

Talk to Bennett before proceeding if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett he is creepy (-1 Bennett)
- Tell Bennett he is not creepy (+2 Bennett)

Talk to Flora in front of PULSE Abra, then proceed to the room in the back. We never actually talked to the Hall of Fame machine... so now we get the chance to do so. Register your team of six!

Sweet. There's just one more thing to do - finish catching the next legendary! Fly back to Agate and make your way to the back room of the Glass Workstation.

Climb the convenient ladder to grab an *Exp. Candy XL*, then go around the right. When you're ready, head up for an Anomaly!

Good ol' Factory Field. CL:4R1-C3 Breloom is back, this time with 5 other Pokemon to support it. Ferrothorn will make your Trick Room strategy tricky though not impossible to manage, so that's not an easy one-and-done thing either. With Roserade and Cinccino granting wide coverage, and Klinklang and Magearna getting really powerful on this field, you're going to need to be careful not to be swept here. You can turn it to Short-Circuit Field if you want, or just overpower them with your own speedy team. As long as you have something that can deal with CL:4R1-C3 somehow, the rest of the team will go down to Fire, Ground, and Fighting moves.

Afterwards, you'll be able to catch **Magearna**!

Head back to the nightclub. If you talk to Eve here, you can get **Aevian Misdreavus**, a cameo from Pokemon Rejuvenation. A Leaf Stone will evolve it into **Aevian Mismagius**.
