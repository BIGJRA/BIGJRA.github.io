# Episode 4: Aftershocks

No gym badge or TM is awarded to you after this fight.

To continue the story, you can either head to Beryl Bridge and watch the intense scene, or make your way south through Jasper to Peridot to skip it. Regardless our next story destination will be the North Obsidia Ward, but there are some very worthwhile quests we can do in the meantime.

## The Mystery Egg and Other Quests

First, after the events at the bridge, enter Corey's gym and enter his bedroom area. Here you'll find the *Silver Ring*, which will help us get some familiar Pokémon! Speaking of which, make your way to the Underroot and head to the bottom right section, then go left and up to reach the large pool in the center. You'll find a **Skrelp** here who will see the Silver Ring and join your team.

Next, head to the Beryl Library. Talk to the Gothitelle here, then pick up trash and stray books all around the library by spamming the action button. Once you finish, talk to Gothitelle for a *Soul Candle*. You can also talk to one of the **Gothita** to obtain it.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Clean up the Library (+1 Adrienn)

Head on over to the Beryl Cemetery at night. Talk to one of the pumpkins with a Soul Candle in your bag and you can catch **Pumpkaboo**.

Head down into Jasper Ward and go left. You'll see a kid being bullied by some Venipede and Scolipede.

**Pokémon Swarm. Field: No Field**
- Venipede, Lv. 34, Ability: Poison Point, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
    - Toxic
    - Protect
    - Venoshock
    - Bug Bite
- Venipede, Lv. 34, Ability: Swarm, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
    - Poison Tail
    - Pursuit
    - Rollout
    - Bug Bite
- Scolipede, Lv. 42, @Muscle Band, Ability: Speed Boost, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
    - Steamroller
    - Poison Tail
    - Pursuit
    - Rollout

Defeat them, and the kid will head back to his home.

Next, it's time for the big one. Head back to the Jasper Police Station and talk to the chief, then talk to the female **Growlithe**. That alone is a decent reward, but we can take this Growlithe and any male Pokémon in its egg group to the daycare to produce an egg. Bring an egg back to the police station and we can trade it with the guy at the bottom to get what the community calls the Mystery Egg.

The Mystery Egg can actually hatch to be one of 18 different Pokémon - all of which are pretty solid team members in an early-game scenario where a lot of the available Pokémon suck. You'll get one of the following, randomly determined:

- **Azurill**
- **Mareanie**
- **Staryu**
- **Togepi**
- **Sneasel**
- **Shroomish**
- **Gastly**
- **Axew**
- **Vulpix-Alola**
- **Pawniard**
- **Litwick**
- **Trapinch**
- **Cottonee**
- **Vulpix**
- **Elekid**
- **Starly**
- **Rockruff**
- **Larvesta**

We can get the other 17 at a later time.

## North Obsidia Ward

With that taken care of, we're going back to Opal Ward to head up at the bridge. You'll enter North Obsidia Ward.

**Psychic Inuki. Field: No Field**
- Porygon2, Lv. 26, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Arcade Star Miku. Field: No Field**
- Swablu, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Arcade Star Akemi. Field: No Field**
- Snubbull, Lv. 24, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Comfey, Lv. 24, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

One more trainer is to the right at the stairs.

**Street Rat Waldon. Field: No Field**
- Shroomish, Lv. 24, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Hippopotas, Lv. 24, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Grotle, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

You'll find hidden *Zinc*, *X Sp. Def*, *Super Potion*, *Ether*, *Common Candy*, *Synthetic Seed*, *Ability Capsule*, *Chewing Gum*, and *Great Ball* around the ward.

Finding this last item will put us in front of the nightclub: from 8PM to 4AM you can enter. You can get one of the best TM's in the game here: *TM17 Protect*!

Outside, the building to your right contains a *Telluric Seed*. There's an alleyway outside containing some gang members nearby.

**North Obsidia Alleyway**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Stunky            |25 |
|Trubbish          |20 |
|Poochyena         |20 |
|Yungoos           |20 |
|**Espurr**        |13 |
|**Mightyena**     |2  |

Don't talk to the guys here quite yet though - we'll be making a choice in a bit involving these guys.

Next, enter the Spyce restaurant below and to the right. A guy inside will give you a *Full Incense*. In a nearby trash can you can find *TM56 Fling*.

!shop("The Spyce", ["Fresh Water", "Soda Pop", "Lemonade"])

Back in the main part of the ward, talk to the people here and in the nearby buildings if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Fern in North Obsidia Ward (+1 Fern)

## Lapis Ward

Head up the stairs to your left to enter the final ward of the city we've yet to explore!

**Lady Lenore (Full Restore). Field: No Field**
- Luvdisc, Lv. 26, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Murkrow, Lv. 26, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Talk to the girl with the colorful hair in front of the very tall building, then head left.

**Hotshot Cole (Full Restore). Field: No Field**
- Quilava, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Skiddo, Lv. 26, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Casanova Wiley (Full Restore). Field: No Field**
- Staravia, Lv. 26, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Lady Anastasia (Full Restore). Field: No Field**
- Mudkip, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
    - Rock Throw
    - Bide
    - Mud Sport
    - Water Gun
- Marshtomp, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Wailmer, Lv. 26, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Make your way to the very top of the area to talk to the purple haired girl and the guy with red hair. After this conversation we'll be free to explore the area. On the right:

**Gentleman Murray (Full Restore). Field: No Field**
- Sunkern, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Marill, Lv. 25, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Hidden around the ward you can find *Great Ball*, *Blue Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, *Salt-Water Taffy*, *Poké Ball*, *X Defend*, and *Exp. Candy M*.

You can enter the Alleyway towards the middle of the ward, but we won't talk to the guys in here quite yet.

**Lapis Alleyway**

|Cave                  |%  |
|----------------------|---|
|Stunky                |25 |
|Trubbish              |20 |
|**Rattata-Alola**     |20 |
|**Meowth-Alola**      |20 |
|Espurr                |13 |
|**Raticate-Alola**    |1  |
|**Persian-Alola**     |1  |

Enter the building in the middle of the top row of buildings, just to the left of the gym. The guy inside will teach your starter the pledge moves for some shards.

!tutor("Lapis Ward Move Tutor", ["Grass Pledge", "Fire Pledge", "Water Pledge"], ["3 Green Shards", "3 Red Shards", "3 Blue Shards"])

Enter the flower shop on the left side of the ward. Someone inside will give you the *Wailmer Pail*. In the top left corner, you can complete a puzzle to get **Spritzee**! The completed puzzle looks like this:

!img("spritzee.jpg")

!shop("Sweet Scent Flowers (Top)", ["Honey", "Oran Berry", "Rose Incense", "Floral Charm", "Sachet", "PokéSnax"])

We will eventually need 2 Floral Charms and around 25-30 Honeys for sidequests later. There is a cheaper option to get the honey later on, however.

!shop("Sweet Scent Flowers (Middle) (0-12 Badges)", ["Red Nectar", "Yellow Nectar", "Pink Nectar", "Purple Nectar"])

If you're planning on switching around your Oricorio a lot, this is the shop for you.

Enter a small house on the left side of the ward and talk to a guy to get *TM21 Frustration*. In the Pokémart to your right, talk to a guy with a hood to get *TM07 Hail*. Next, enter the building to the right. For saving the kid from Scolipede, the mom here will give you the *Department Store Sticker: Drifloon*.

!shop("Department Store 4F (Left)", ["Air Balloon", "White Herb", "Mental Herb", "Power Herb", "Absorb Bulb", "Snowball"])

Some consumables that may be useful in a pinch. We will much later on need a White Herb for a quest.

!shop("Department Store 4F (Right)", ["Smoke Ball", "Destiny Knot", "Power Weight", "Power Bracer", "Power Belt", "Power Anklet", "Power Lens", "Power Band", "TM48 Round"], [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, 9000])

Finally some good things for sale in this building. The Power Items raise 32 EV's per defeated Pokémon and cancel out other EV's. Meaning if you catch a new Pokémon you simply have to defeat any 8 Pokémon with a Power Item to max out - or 17 total for a usual 252/252/4 spread. This is so incredibly fast that there is virtually no reason not to EV train in this game given how tough the fights can be. These are probably a bit too pricey for us right now, but keep in mind that they're here so when we have the cash we can immediately max out our EV's. If you're planning on breeding you can get a Destiny Knot.

Anyways, that's all we can do in Lapis for now, so head back down to the North Obsidia Ward.

## The Grand Stairway

Talk to Cain here, and he will distract an officer so you can slip by.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to the guard 4 times while Cain is distracting him (-1 Cain)

You can find a hidden *Rock Gem* on the stairs. Head on down the ladder. You can find a *Green Shard* hidden in this first area. Head down the stairs again.

**Grand Stairway B1F**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|**Sandshrew**     |30 |
|**Graveler**      |21 |
|Noibat            |20 |
|**Diglett**       |10 |
|**Geodude**       |10 |
|**Chingling**     |8  |
|**Dunsparce**     |1  |

We will eventually need both a Chimecho and a Dunsparce for some sidequests, so get them here.

On this floor you'll find a hidden *Ghost Gem*. Head down the ladder.

**Grand Stairway B2F / B3F East**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Sandshrew         |30 |
|Graveler          |25 |
|Geodude           |15 |
|Diglett           |10 |
|Chingling         |10 |
|**Unown**         |5  |
|Dunsparce         |5  |

Pick up a hidden *Red Shard* and a *Dire Hit* to the right. Below here, you'll notice that there are some ledges we can hop down. If you hop down exactly four times, you can find a hidden *Focus Sash* here. Consider saving this for a situation that you really need it.

Down from here there are essentially four paths we can take down the ledges. I start by heading down the rightmost path first. Pick up a hidden *Guard Spec* then take the ladder. In the next room you can grab a hidden *Star Piece* then head into the small cave here. "The Crystals glimmer with fissures" is a clue related to field effects - see if you can figure it out.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    The solution: use Magnitude or Bulldoze here on the field. Many of the wild Pokémon have one of these moves.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the answer</a>
</div>

Once you do so, you can grab the *Crystal Cavern Field Readout*. Head back out then go up the ladder at the top. You can find a hidden *Heart Scale* as well as a *Magical Seed* and a *Exp. Candy M*. Can't do anything else here so head up the next ladder. In here you can pick up an *Ability Capsule* and hidden *Exp. Candy M* and *Red-Hots*.

You'll notice that we're back on B1F, so head back down the ladder below to reach the ledges on B2F. This time we are going to take the ledges down to go all the way to the left. You'll reach a ladder. Upstairs, you can find a hidden *Ground Gem* and *Super Repel*. Head down the ledge - again we'll find ourselves at the familiar area of B1F.

Head down to the sequence of ledges again. This time we will take the second-path from the left. Use your itemfinder as you're going down and you can obtain a *Green Shard*. Head to the left and go straight up. A guy will give you 3 *Exp. Candy M*. Nearby is a hidden *Blue Shard*. Go down the first set of stairs from here. You'll see a little pool of water coming out of the wall - head to the left from here, past some rocks to the left, to  obtain *TM69 Rock Polish*! Head back down until you can go to the right. Climb these stairs - you'll find a hidden *Psychic Gem*, *X Speed*, and *PokéSnax* along the way.

Finally, we can take the huge series of ledges to take the third path from the left. Grab the hidden *X Sp. Atk* then head down the ladder here.

**Grand Stairway B3F Main**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Unown             |100|

Talk to the guy in the center here, then head to the left and talk to the two here for a battle.

**Meteor Private Aster and Meteor Private Eclipse (2x Super Potion). Field: Crystal Cavern Field**
- Lunatone, Lv. 30, IVs: 10
    - Rock Polish
    - Psywave
    - Hypnosis
    - Rock Slide
- Lycanroc-Midday, Lv. 32, Ability: Sand Rush, Jolly Nature, IVs: 20
    - Fire Fang
    - Accelerock
    - Bite
    - Quick Attack
- Solrock, Lv. 30, IVs: 10
    - Rock Polish
    - Psywave
    - Fire Spin
    - Rock Slide
- Lycanroc-Midnight, Lv. 32, Ability: No Guard, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Thunder Fang
    - Rock Tomb
    - Bite
    - Howl

Their four rock types have their attacks boosted on the field. They're all pretty fast, especially Midday Lycanroc, so you have to have a bit of bulk to live. With the help of Victoria's fighting type moves though you will probably be able to find a way through this with a team of six.

You can accept Victoria's fast travel request afterwards.Back in North Obsidia Ward, Victoria will request that you battle her.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Say No to Victoria's battle request (-1 Victoria)

**Apprentice Victoria (2x Super Potion). Field: No Field**
- Pancham, Lv. 30, Ability: Scrappy, Adamant Nature, IVs: 10
    - Arm Thrust
    - Work Up
    - Slash
    - Circle Throw
- Kirlia, Lv. 31, Ability: Trace, Bashful Nature, IVs: 21
    - Double Team
    - Magical Leaf
    - Psychic
    - Calm Mind
- Pikachu, Lv. 32, @Light Ball, Ability: Lightning Rod, IVs: 10
    - Nuzzle
    - Nasty Plot
    - Electro Ball
    - Fake Out
- Torracat, Lv. 33, Ability: Intimidate, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Bite
    - Fire Fang
    - Double Kick
    - Lick

Since last time, Victoria has evolved some of her team, but she shouldn't be too much of a threat if you've been able to defeat all the gym leaders to this point. She has a bit of diversity on her team: Kirlia and Pikachu can hit moderately hard with their STAB Special moves. Torracat will dampen your physical sweeper and fight get some lucky flinches with Bite or Fire Fang. Ultimately, you can probably find a way to set up on Pancham or just overwhelm her in a 6v4.

This is part of another gauntlet: time for another battle right after, though you do get healed.

**Swag Jockey Fern (2x Super Potion). Field: No Field**
- Rhyhorn, Lv. 30, Ability: Reckless, Brave Nature, IVs: 20
    - Bulldoze
    - Rock Blast
    - Chip Away
    - Fire Fang
- Krokorok, Lv. 31, Ability: Moxie, Adamant Nature, IVs: 25
    - Dig
    - Smack Down
    - Crunch
    - Fire Fang
- Dartrix, Lv. 32, Ability: Long Reach, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Synthesis
    - Pluck
    - Ominous Wind
    - Razor Leaf
- Roserade, Lv. 33, Ability: Poison Point, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sleep Powder
    - Giga Drain
    - Extrasensory
    - Hidden Power

Since last time, Fern has evolved his Roselia into Roserade, picked up a Rhyhorn, and evolved his Sandile. Thankfully, Rhyhorn and Dartrix aren't too incredible and each have exploitable 4x weaknesses. You don't want to let Krokorok sweep you, but it isn't too strong until it gets it's first boost, so a good switch can help against it. The big threat here is 31 IV Roserade - it's really fast and likes to pickup one-shots with Giga Drain and heal off whatever damage you've managed to get on it. Thankfully Rhyhorn isn't really a threat to most Pokémon, so the key to this fight is figuring out how to put yourself in a position to knock out Roserade before it comes out.

After winning, you'll be given *TMX7 Rock Smash*. We can't use it in the field yet, however.

Head to the nightclub up and to the right. You'll see a guy outside who you can talk to.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Meet DJ Arclight outside the nightclub (+1 Arclight)

Head back to Lapis Ward and attempt to enter the gym. Time for a battle!

**Volcanic Cal. Field: Rainbow Field atop No Field**
- Torkoal, Lv. 30, @Heat Rock, Ability: Drought, Mild Nature, IVs: 5
    - Stealth Rock
    - Fire Spin
    - Nature Power
    - Hidden Power
- Houndoom, Lv. 31, Ability: Flash Fire, Hasty Nature, IVs: 20
    - Inferno
    - Beat Up
    - Snarl
    - Smog
- Quilava, Lv. 32, Ability: Blaze, Modest Nature, IVs: 20
    - Nature Power
    - Incinerate
    - Hidden Power
    - Flame Charge
- Charmeleon, Lv. 33, Ability: Blaze, Serious Nature, IVs: 20
    - Flame Burst
    - Dragon Rage
    - Mega Punch
    - Smokescreen
- Magmortar, Lv. 34, @Oran Berry, Ability: Flame Body, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Mach Punch
    - Belch
    - Feint Attack
    - Fire Punch

The game makes it rain on the overworld before this fight, so Drought Torkoal will cause it to be a Rainbow Field battle for eight turns. This makes Nature Power turn into boosted Aurora Beam, interestingly giving Ice type coverage to a Fire monotype team. Anyways, his team is fairly strong for this point under sun, so you're gonna have to be careful not to let his Houndoom and Magmortar destroy you with powered up Fire moves. The Rainbow field will also increase chances to burn, so your physical attackers may become crippled. One strategy you can use is changing the weather to something else; Rain will dampen his attacks, while the other two will cancel the Rainbow Field and deal chip damage. If you can knock out Torkoal he has no way to set up Sun after the first time, so you can use the Protect and Substitute TMs we now have to stall out the sun if you need to.

Head into the gym and go upstairs. Talk to the group here, then head outside and attempt to enter the orphanage in the center of Lapis Ward. A girl will leave. Head in. Inside, you'll have to defeat an Orderly.

**Orderly John. Field: No Field**
- Slowpoke, Lv. 31, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Eelektrik, Lv. 31, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Magneton, Lv. 32, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

After you leave, head back to the gym and go upstairs. We have our next mission: challenging Shelly for a badge. We can talk to Victoria here as well.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Victoria after Shelly tells you to have a battle with her (+1 Cal)

## Joining a Gang

Before fighting Shelly, time for a quest. We are required to join a gang to finish the game. Technically we can do this later, but we might as well start now since there are some nice rewards. You get to choose which gang to join: the Magma Gang in the North Obsidia Alleyway, or the Aqua Gang in the Lapis Alleyway. Head over to your choice of alleyway.

### The Magma Gang Route (Part 1)

Skip to the next section if you chose the Aqua Gang.

Talk to the guys guarding the North Obsidia alleyway for a battle.

- Staryu, Lv. 33, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

You'll find a *Fire Stone* as well as **Buizel**. Talk to Maxwell inside, then head back to the Lapis Alleyway to talk to him again.

We can now continue our ongoing stolen Pokémon quest as well. Just south of the North Obsidia alleyway you can find a Magma Gang member. He will tell you he already lost the Pokémon to an Aqua Gang member, but will give you a *Metronome*.

Head over to the Lapis Ward. To the west of the gym you'll find the Aqua Gang member.

**Aqua Gang Jakob. Field: No Field**
- Toxapex, Lv. 37, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Lapras, Lv. 37, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Sharpedo, Lv. 38, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Defeat him... only to learn he already sold the Pokémon to someone in 7th Street. That's all we can do for now.

### The Aqua Gang Route (Part 1)

Talk to the guys guarding the Lapis alleyway for a battle.

Make your way to the shack to the right of the flower shop in Lapis Ward. Talk to Archer here.

Just for completeness, Archer won't be blocking the pond in the alleyway anymore so we can fish here now.

**Lapis Alleyway**

|Old Rod           |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Barboach          |100|

Anyways, make your way to Ms. Craudberry's house, which is south of the Lapis Pokémon Center. Head into the backroom.

**Magma Gang Darm. Field: No Field**
- Darumaka, Lv. 32, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Head over to the Lapis Ward. To the west of the gym you'll find the Aqua Gang member. You'll learn that he already sold the Pokémon to someone in 7th Street, but he'll give you a *Metronome*. That's all we can do for now.

### Getting the Bicycle and Zorua

Regardless of your gang choice, head over to Madame Craudberry's house once more. Inside, she'll try to get you arrested, but if you have saved all the Jasper Ward police officers, they'll trust that you are not a gang member. Hehehe.

Head outside and try to leave, and the cop will even give you a *Bike Voucher*! Enter the building below and trade it away to get the *Bicycle*! Heck yes.

Now that we have our fancy bicycle, we can very quickly get all the way to Beryl Ward from Lapis Ward... so let's do that. Go onto the rooftop of the building where we once captured Helioptile on a clear night, and you'll see... Corey? Make your way to Peridot Ward next, where you'll encounter him near the Pokémart. Finally, head to North Obsidia Ward and enter the building to the left of the alleyway. Inside you'll find him once more... and be able to catch **Zorua**!

## Grand Hall Trainers 3

After defeating Corey, the trainers in the Grand Hall have gotten stronger once again. Defeating them will now yield 5 *Exp. Candy M*! The updated teams are as follows:

## Cocoon Badge

Now it's time to go for our badge. Head into Shelly's gym and go to the right.

**Techie Eugene. Field: Forest Field**
- Burmy, Lv. 29, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Mothim, Lv. 30, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Wormadam, Lv. 30, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Lady Eve. Field: Forest Field**
- Shuckle, Lv. 32, Ability: Contrary, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

In the back, accessible by using either of the two monitors behind the trainers:

**Techie Charlie. Field: Forest Field**
- Beautifly, Lv. 30, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Charjabug, Lv. 30, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

**Lady Lily. Field: Forest Field**
- Swadloon, Lv. 31, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

There is a front area, a back area, and upstairs - your goal is to turn every single monitor that is in the area on and still successfully get to the upstairs area and cross the bookshelves. You can only cross from the front to the back area if one of the red, blue, and yellow stacks is exactly 1 unit tall.

Using this information, it can be fun to try to solve this puzzle yourself. The game actually has a cheeky secret way to solve it though:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Simply check monitors for a light above or below it. If it is yellow, ignore it, if it is green, click that one next.  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the secret to the Lapis Gym puzzle</a>
</div>

Whichever way you solve the puzzle, click the final monitor that you can find upstairs, then cross the bookshelves. You can find a *Leaf Stone* nearby.

Head up, and save before you fight Shelly.

I think this fight is wonderful because it sweeps the feet out from under new players that think Bug is a terrible type. The Forest Field, as we've seen, powers up Struggle Bug. It also gives Anorith a free Spiky Shield due to its seed. More notable however is Prankster Illumise's eight turn Rain Dance - it prevents you from burning the forest down, activates Anorith's Swift Swim, weakens your Fire types, and powers the various Water moves she uses. Plus it's the first gym that fights in doubles and the combination of Intimidate and Struggle Bug can make your attacks weak - all this combines to making a difficult fight that your team might not immediately be prepared for.

To win, you'll have to come up with a solid doubles strategy. Luckily at this point in the game you do have some options. The simplest yet cheesiest option is to use Castform/Cherrim's Sunny Day or mystery egg Vulpix's Drought to make it sunny, which turns the field to Rainbow Field. You can then exploit the Rainbow Field by using Nature Power into boosted Aurora Beam and/or 140 flat damage Sonicboom to win. You can also switch up the weather to Hail or Sandstorm - this allows you to use specific Fire type moves to turn the field to the Burning Field, which is basically game over for Shelly if Illumise is knocked out.

Another generally solid strategy is just abusing the field with your own Bug types - Joltik, Vespiquen, and all of the early-evolving stage 3 bugs can to some extent really shine here. You can use Telluric Seeds if you have them as well. Alternatively, bring your own Swift Swim team to abuse the rain and outspeed her team. Also consider the funny Rock Slide button. Tons of options here if you think ahead about what your strategy will be.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Shelly on your first try (+1 Victoria)
- Defeat Shelly on a second, third, etc. try (-1 Victoria)

After you succeed, you will get the *Cocoon Badge* as well as *TM76 Struggle Bug*, you get to use Lv. 40 Pokémon, and you can now use Rock Smash in the field.
