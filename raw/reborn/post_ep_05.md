# Postgame Episode 5: Wish Upon a Star

The level cap secretly has risen to Lv. 125!

## Unexplored Territory

Talk to Nyu in the Nightclub and accept his quest. Fly on over to the Agate Circus, head to Route 2, then enter the Ametrine Mountain on top. From here, surf down the waterfall into 1F. Move the boulder from below on the left side, then climb the waterfall to cross the path from above. Dive down here to reach B1F.

Once you cross the B2F ice puzzle, go to the top left corner of this room and dive down. Follow this path all the way to a New World Door!

!enc(856, nil, nil, "Unexplored Territory Underwater")

Proceed to the dive spot and surface.

!enc(857)

Go down and weasel your way between some rocks to find:

**ZCell 26: Unexplored Territory**

!img("zcell_26.jpg")

Head up onto the land once you're ready for a battle with Florinia as your ally.

!partner(["Florinia", :FLORINIA, 4])

!dbattle(["Latias", :LATIAS, 0], ["Latios", :LATIOS, 0], "Mountain Field")

Nothing too insane here - another Mountain Field fight. Only Cobalion and Typhlosion resist Ice on this field, so I recommend switching it to Snowy Mountain and going nuts if you get stuck.

Once you succeed, head north across the water and talk to Latias again. Essentially, the next quest will require us to build a translation key based on these orb things, scattered all around this little town. Explore every corner of this town - some are accessible only via the water, to find the way. Be sure to try to weasel your way between the rocks on the lake - there are some accessible paths you might not expect.

By the way, in the bottom left corner, you can find:

**ZCell 27: Unexplored Territory**

!img("zcell_27.jpg")

Once you've found as many translations as you can, talk to Latias to learn a list of possible emotions, in English. These include Shock, Anxiety, Grief, Sorrow, Fear, Envy, Guilt, Passion, Confidence, Emptiness, Pride, Joy, Love, Disgust, Anger, and Apathy. Essentially, we will need to talk to the Florinia's around the area, diagnose them for one of these emotions, then translate it from the English word into the "emotion" word.

The Florinia to the left of Latias, across the bridge, is the first one I was able to solve. The answer:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    ANGER, which translates to GMKR@
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #1</a>
</div>

You'll also be able to help the Florinia in the double-doored building to the right, on the second floor. The solution:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    GUILT, which translates to K=XJ7
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #2</a>
</div>

The bottom right Florinia across some water has the solution:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    SORROW, which translates to F5@@5#
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #3</a>
</div>

With all three solved, you can proceed to the next area, to the left of where Latias previously was. The cipher will remain the same, with new keys discovered in this next area.

The Florinia to the bottom right of Latias:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    JOY, which translates to %5H
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #4</a>
</div>

At the top of the large building in the top left corner, the solution:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    PASSION, which translates to YGFFX5M
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #5</a>
</div>

Return to Latias, up from here is a new path we can follow. Enter this room.

!enc(859, nil, nil, "Unexplored Territory Forest Room")

Inside this forest-like room, we can diagnose another emotion:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    FEAR, which translates to ?RG@
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #6</a>
</div>

Back outside, a new gate will open to the right. Follow it, get some new clues, and talk to her at the top to solve the final puzzle:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    LOVE, which translates to J5TR
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Emotion #7</a>
</div>

With that, Florinia will have some revelations and leave. **Latias** and **Latios** will now go with you, as well!

On Lin Route, you'll even get the chance to fast travel out of here. Somehow, return to the Nightclub.

## Aegir Cave Depths

Talk to Aster in the Nightclub and agree to the quest. Make your way through Victory Road into the Aegir Cave once more.

When you're in Aegir Cave, make your way down onto the lake and dive down. You'll see a crack of light towards the bottom, slightly right and down from the underwater cave entrance we previously entered. Enter the cave via this crack of light and surface.

!enc(860)

Grab a hidden *Rawst Berry*, then surf to the left and climb the waterfall to reach:

**ZCell 28: Aegir Cave Depths**

!img("zcell_28.jpg")

You can also climb the rightmost waterfall by going around the rocks to get the *Prison Bottle*!

Climb down the waterfall at the bottom to descend.

Grab the hidden *Dusk Ball*, *Fairy Gem*, *Max Potion*, *Exp. Candy XL*, and *Iron* in here. Climb the ladder to the right.

This floor has a hidden *Rock Gem* and *Super Repel*. Continue up the ladder to the next floor, which contains a hidden *Full Restore*. Climb up once more to find an *Exp. Candy XL* and a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Protein*. The next floor has a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Max Repel*. Enter the New World Door at the end.

Talk to the earring at the top, then exit back to the Aegir Cave Depths once the scene occurs. Now we'll be descending, following the paths that will open up as we go.

You can get a hidden *Max Potion* and *Ultra Ball* on the top floor. The next has a hidden *Red Shard*, *Stardust*, and *Cotton Candy*. Crossing the waterfall and climbing down the ladder will lead you to a hidden *Great Ball* and:

**ZCell 29: Aegir Cave Depths**

!img("zcell_29.jpg")

Climb back up and use the ladder on the other side of the waterfall to descend. On this floor, cross the waterfall to get a *Timer Ball*. This area also contains a hidden *Heart Scale* and *Oran Berry*. The floor after this contains a hidden *Level Ball* and *Full Restore*. Back on the lowest level, you can get a hidden *Poké Ball*. Talk to our pal when you're ready for a fight.

!battle(["Cain", :UMBCAIN, 0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

First fight on this field in a while, but it's only a 6v6. Psh.

In the next room, use the Light Shard and grab the hidden *Dusk Ball* and *Max Repel*. Head up when you're ready.

!dbattle(["Diancie", :DIANCIE, 0], ["Aegislash", :DIASWORD, 0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

These two don't make up a massive team, but are quite a huge pain. Try to get rid of Diancie on the first turn: the simplest way is probably using the Steelium-Z. Afterward, two at a time, you'll have to wear down the Crystal Aegislash. Knocking down one of its defensive stats may be useful - due to its massive HP, Counter and Mirror Coat may not be as effective. Endeavor, Destiny Bond, etc. are all excellent here as well. Or, the fun way: changing the field to Cave and collapsing it!

Afterwards, you'll be able to fight and catch **Diancie**. Behind is the *Griseous Orb*, for some reason. Talk to Cain outside, then agree to escape together.

It's worth noting that now that we've gotten to fight Crystal Aegislash, two of the developers in the Grand Hall secret room have slightly updated teams.

!battle(["Autumn", :AUTUMN, 1], "Rainbow Field")

!battle(["Crim", :CRIM, 1], "Starlight Arena")

Return to the Nightclub!

## Ametrine Core

Talk to your gang leader and accept the quest. He gives us the hint that we'll need to reach our destination by diving somewhere in Celestinine Mountain. Fly over to Route 1, get on a Tauros, and make your way to the mountain via the North Aventurine Woods, third entrance from the left. Once inside, surf to the bottom left corner and dive down. Towards the top of the underwater area, you'll see a lit up door, so head through it and surface. Enter the next room to reach the Ametrine Core.

**Ametrine Core (First Room)**

Talk to Cal at the entrance, then head up and smash the rock. Talk to Cal at the top, and Blake will show up. Essentially, we'll need to switch the room from hot (Cal) to cold (Blake) and vice versa to clear obstacles.

- Start by making it hot and talk to the crystal down and to the left. Make your way down and left to talk to another crystal.
- Next, make it cold and follow the now-opened path to the bottom left and cross the ice. Head up from here, surf across, and use this crystal to make a path back to the center. Down and to the right is another crystal: use it to make more lava platforms.
- Make it hot, then go to the right. Up from here, use the next crystal.
- Making it cold again, follow the path to the right that we just opened. Activate the crystal here, then return to the center.
- Make it hot, then follow the long path in the bottom right corner of the room to another crystal.
- Make it cold. Straight up from here is a crystal: activate it. Next, go to the left of the center and activate the crystal on top of the stairs to the left. Go to the right side of the room, now following the path to reach the top, and activate a crystal to make another shortcut to the center.
- Make it hot, go to the top of the room, and smash the rock.
- Make it cold one more time and follow the path at the top to another crystal. Head into the next room at the top.

|Spiritomb          |1  |                   |   |

In this room, another puzzle awaits.

- Start by using the crystal to the left.
- Turn it cold and activate the crystal up on the hill. Follow the new path across the lava and push the boulder to the right, out of the way.
- Make it hot, then surf up, use the crystal, and return to the bottom.
- Make it cold and use the crystal above. Cross the lava, activate the next crystal, and return.
- Make it hot, then activate the crystal in the top left.
- Make it cold once more. This time, head to the left side of the room, and hop down the long chain of ledges. It will take you around to the right side of the room, where you can activate another crystal. Cross the lava and push this boulder to the left.
- Turn up the heat and climb down the ladder at the top!

Follow the path from here. Time for a battle!

!battle(["Heatran", :HEATRAN, 0], "Corrosive Mist Field")

Well, that at least explains why Blake and Cal kept talking about poisonous gases. You can blow away this field if the Poison is too much for you, but it does poison lots of your opponents too, so a Poison or Steel type might be able to stall their way to victory.

Once you win, you can catch **Heatran**!

Blow the popsicle stand and return to the Nightclub.

## Splash Grounds

Talk to the Ringmaster in the Nightclub and accept the next quest. Fly on over to the Scrapyard in the desert. In a traincar to the left, you'll find a warp that takes you to the Mirage Tower, so proceed there. Make your way through the tower - when you eventually come upon the "fake" exterior, you'll notice that the water now has some dive spots. Dive on down!

|Kingdra            |1  |

Grab the *Relic Copper* in the first room. There is a small door to the right of the large one - go in here. Grab the *Relic Copper* and *Relic Silver* inside. You'll also find:

**ZCell 30: Splash Zone**

!img("zcell_30.jpg")

Back in the entrance room, enter the large door, and grab another 2 *Relic Coppers* in the next. Grab the 3 *Manaphy Gems* on the dais. Use it to open the door at the top. Grab the *Relic Copper* in the next room, and start by going right at the fork. Along the way, you'll find 2 *Relic Coppers* and:

**ZCell 31: Splash Zone**

!img("zcell_31.jpg")

Follow the other path from the fork. Pick up the *Relic Copper* and proceed. You'll find a room with... 2 more *Relic Coppers* and a door to use the Manaphy Gem on.

The path from here contains a *Relic Copper* but also two *Relic Silvers*! Use the last Manaphy Gem and continue, grabbing the 3 *Relic Coppers*, *Relic Silver*, and even one *Relic Gold*! Prepare for a fight and talk to Manaphy at the top.

!battle(["Manaphy", :MANAPHY, 0], "Underwater")

A tricky fight - one that fully utilizes the shenanigans of the Underwater Field. Essentially, it boils down to three main types: Dhelmise, who hits ridiculously hard and does extra damage thanks to Anchor Shot, Whirlpool, and Steelworker getting buffs, Manaphy itself, whose Hydration is always on and basically means it can stall you out with free Rest every turn, boost with Tail Glow, and sweep with boosted Water Pulse and Twinkle Tackle if needed, and "the other four" who have seeds that transform them into Water types, basically 4 balls of stats and coverage moves. These Pokémon do have lots of Electric moves to cover your own Water type shenanigans, so it won't be as easy as equipping seeds and going... probably. Heliolisk in particular is annoying, since it absorbs both Ground and Water moves (field adds the latter to the former), and hits hard and heals with Parabolic Charge.

If you want to run with the field, you can use your own Water types and carefully navigate a sweep. One alternative, fun idea is to bring a fast Flying or Water type to use Fly or Dive to bring the fight to the Water Surface, which takes away the crazy speed difference and takes away the type changes on the four. Then you can sweep more "normally" or switch again to Murkwater or Icy Field if you feel like it.

Once you win, you can catch **Manaphy**! Exit the Splash Grounds.

## Tabula Rasa

Talk to Seacrest in the Nightclub and accept the quest - we're going back to Victory Road. I'll spoil a bit of the upcoming gameplay a little bit: we're going to need to be able to transform the field into the four 'canon' Terrains, so make sure you have something in your PC that can create these fields, like so:

- Electric Terrain: Stoked Sparksurfer, Ion Deluge, Plasma Fists, Electric Terrain
- Psychic Terrain: Psychic Terrain
- Grassy Terrain: Bloom Doom, Grassy Terrain
- Misty Terrain: Mist, Misty Terrain

Fly on over to Charous Hall and enter Victory Road from the back. Take the warp from Florinia's puzzle room to the hub room. We're going to need to go to each of the four rooms - I will start with Ruby once more! Thankfully we can just use the warps here to return, so take the red warp and enter the New World Door.

You'll learn about electricity sizzling through the air. Talk to the pillar in this area to fight a wild Unown - finish the battle while the field is Electric Terrain and the map will transform!

**ZCell 32: Tabula Rasa**

!img("zcell_32.jpg")

!battle(["Tapu-Koko", :TAPUKOKO, 0], "Electric Terrain")

A fairly standard Electric Terrain team. Trick Room goes brrrr.

Catch **Tapu Koko** once you win!

Next is the Sapphire Room - and the schtick is the same, this time you have to transform the field into Misty Terrain.

!battle(["Tapu-Fini", :TAPUFINI, 0], "Misty Terrain")

A decent team on a not-too-terrifying Field. Poison the mist if you're feeling epic. Catch **Tapu Fini** afterwards!

Next is Emerald. Transform the field to Grassy Terrain, then prepare for a fight.

!battle(["Tapu-Bulu", :TAPUBULU, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Gengar likes to use Sludge Wave, transforming the field into Corrosive Field. This literally OHKO's Tapu Bulu as it steps onto the field. Now this is epic. Catch **Tapu Bulu** afterwards!

Finally, go to Amethyst and transform the field to Psychic Terrain.

!battle(["Tapu-Lele", :TAPULELE, 0], "Psychic Terrain")

This is our first mandatory battle with built-in Psychic Terrain... and you'll probably see why this field is a huge pain here. Telepathy just, doubles speed, so three of your opponents will easily outspeed. That's on top of massive boosts to an already great type, and Psych Up... oh god why. You'll know what I mean when you see it.

Trick Room is good here, even extended for free, so that's neat. Your own Psych Up can work wonders here if need be. Haze and Taunt can also help you keep your sanity here.

Catch **Tapu Lele** once you're done, then make your way back to the Nightclub.

## Not Truly For Children

Talk to Zero and accept the quest. Once more, make your way back down to Sigmund's body... and enter the New World Door.

This area is quite linear... and sad. Once you're back in your own skin, head up for a battle.

!battle(["Jirachi", :JIRACHI, 0], "Psychic Terrain")

More Psychic Terrain? Joy. This one is honestly less bad than the previous thanks to a lack of Doubles Psych Up shenanigans, however.

Once you win, you'll be able to catch **Jirachi**.

After a small section as Siggy again, you'll find yourself in the Orphanage once more. Head upstairs and watch a small scene.

**ZCell 33: Not Truly For Children**

!img("zcell_33.jpg")

Approach the shining object downstairs once you're ready.

!battle(["Euphie", :EUPHIE, 0], "Psychic Terrain")

Another tricky Psychic Terrain team. His Mimikyu in particular is a huge pain thanks to its ability and Sash, so if you can save a good Z Move to eradicate it, that might be ideal. If you have something to deal with Mega Mawile a Dark type can go nuts here. Or, you can abuse boosted Hex yourself, particularly effective on top of Toxic Spikes.

Go downstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Euphie that you understand (+1 Shade)
- Tell Euphie that you don't understand (-1 Shade)

Gauntlet time.

!partner(["Euphie", :EUPHIE, 0])

!dbattle(["Noel", :NOEL2, 1], ["Anna", :ANNA, 1], "Psychic Terrain")

More Psychic Terrain! At least with Euphie as a partner, he uses the Field Effect well. Anna is the real threat here - Noel doesn't get a ton out of the Field and his team is somewhat slow, so I recommend targeting Anna first overall. The Meloetta pair can be deadly, so watch out for them. Spreading status can also help Euphie sweep with Hex.

!dbattle(["Charlotte", :CHARLOTTE, 1], ["Laura", :LAURA, 2], "Psychic Terrain")

Honestly? Facing Laura not on Flower Field is more of a relief than not. This probably won't be the fight that ruins most of your gauntlet attempts.

!dbattle(["Lin", :CHILDLIN, 1], ["Antics", :ANTICS, 0], "Psychic Terrain")

This fight is where fun comes to die! Psych Up! Serene Grace spam! And worst of all: CHANSEY. Good luck, you'll need it. Literally.

That's it for this tier of legendary quests! Return to the Nightclub when you're ready to.
