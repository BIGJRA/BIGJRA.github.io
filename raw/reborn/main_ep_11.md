# Episode 11: Out of Light

After everything goes dark, head out of the gym. Once you get outside, use the Light Shard and head out into the labyrinth.

!battle(["Ricardo", :MeteorGrunt, 4], "Grassy Terrain")

The grunt to the left is Radomus in disguise and will allow you to escape via walking on top of the hedges. Make your way to the other side of the labyrinth and battle the grunts if you wish.

!battle(["Christopher", :MeteorGrunt, 2], "Grassy Terrain")

!battle(["Hilda", :MeteorGrunt_090, 4], "Grassy Terrain")

!battle(["Ama", :MeteorGrunt, 2], "Grassy Terrain")

Escape the labyrinth, hop on the circling Tauros to skip to the other side of Route 1, then enter Reborn City.

## Seventh Street

If you haven't completed the [gang sidequest](#joining-a-gang) up until now, you'll need to do that now.

Talk to your gang leader, and they will tell you about Seventh Street. To reach it with Aqua Gang, use the top left house in Lapis, with Magma Gang, use a house on the left in the center of Lapis.

Wander around the area and defeat all the trainers. Note that you'll only need to fight the Aqua Gang members if you're in Magma Gang and vice versa. From top to bottom:

!battle(["Austin", :StreetRat, 0])

!battle(["Chaz", :StreetRat, 0])

!battle(["Pierce", :AQUA2, 1])

!battle(["Razzy", :AQUA1, 1])

!battle(["Darm", :MAGMA2, 1])

!battle(["Nihil", :MAGMA1, 1])

!battle(["Andy", :StreetRat, 0])

!battle(["Kevin", :StreetRat, 0])

Hidden around the map you'll find 2 *Purple Shards*, *Common Candy*, 2 *Blue Shards*, 2 *Green Shards*, *Pecha Berry*, *X Sp. Atk*, 2 *Red Shards*, and *Calcium*. The house in the middle of the top contains a healing point and PC. Talk to all of the NPC's in the area and you'll learn about what you can get down here in 7th.

Towards the top of the map you'll find an *Ability Capsule* salesperson. They'll trade you one for first 1, then 2, and from then on 3 shards of a random color. Useful! Up and to the right we'll find a couple of tutors.

!tutor("Seventh Street Move Tutor 1", [["Role Play", "1 Purple Shard"], ["Covet", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Electroweb", "3 Green Shards"], ["Sky Attack", "2 Red Shards"]])

!tutor("Seventh Street Move Tutor 2", [["Trick", "2 Purple Shards"], ["Defog", "2 Red Shards"], ["Laser Focus", "1 Blue Shard"], ["Skill Swap", "1 Green Shard"]])

!tutor("Seventh Street Move Tutor 3", [["Water Pulse", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Last Resort", "2 Purple Shards"], ["Super Fang", "3 Green Shards"], ["Shock Wave", "3 Red Shards"]])

!tutor("Seventh Street Move Tutor 4", [["Headbutt", "3 Blue Shards"], ["Bounce", "3 Purple Shards"], ["Heal Bell", "4 Green Shards"], ["Bug Bite", "3 Red Shards"]])

None of these are mindblowing, but some of them can be useful for certain strategies. As usual, these are pay once, relearn forever.

The guy to the right is selling random stuff:

!shop("Seventh Street Misc. Wares (Right)", ["Adrenaline Orb", "Metal Powder", "Ill-Fated Doll", "Iron Ball", "Lucky Punch", "Eject Button", "Data Chip", "Magnet Powder", ["TM64 Explosion", 7500]])

Pricey, but we finally have the ability to get as many data chips as we want for password inputs. We will also want a Magnet Powder for a quest later. There is another seller in the bottom left corner.

!shop("Seventh Street Misc. Wares (Left)", ["Oval Stone", "Quick Powder", "Sticky Barb", "Charcoal", "Soul Candle", "Light Ball", "Stick", "Float Stone", "Binding Band"])

Grab a Soul Candle and a Stick for later quests.

To the right, you'll see one of your gang members making a sale:

!shop("Seventh Street Blast Powder Shop", ["Blast Powder"])

Blast Powder will essentially let us mine all the mining rocks a second time. Buy at least 5 for now since there are a few things actually gated behind the mining rocks we'll want to grab, but getting more won't hurt. For what it's worth, saving in front of a rock until you find a Star Piece or Rare Bone in the rubble you can guarantee a return on investment for these things.

Enter the cage area in the bottom right corner. Here, a guy will be selling all of the Pokémon we previously worked with in the Blacksteam Meteor Factory.

!shop("Seventh Street Pokémon", [["Vanillite", "3 Purple Shards", true], ["Loudred", "5 Blue Shards", true], ["Roggenrola", "3 Red Shards", true], ["Abra", "8 Purple Shards", true], ["Lickitung", "7 Blue Shards", true], ["Makuhita", "3 Green Shards", true], ["Jigglypuff", "5 Green Shards", true], ["Cyndaquil", "9 Red Shards", true]])

There is a sidequest later with a fantastic reward that will involve returning specifically Vanillite, Loudred, Roggenrola, Lickitung, and Makuhita to their original owners. I recommend breeding these Pokémon if you want to use them long term, keeping the originals in your PC.

If you've been picking up hidden items and mining most of the rocks, you should have enough shards to get every Pokémon here, but you can always come back later to complete this quest. From now on, shards will mainly be useful only for unlocking tutors and buying Ability Capsules.

If you've kept up so far with the game-spanning quest, beginning with our purchase of a mystery Pokémon from the Grand Hall, you can now continue it. For just 2 Blue Shards, you can buy back your Pokémon... just kidding, it gets stolen again!!!

Anyways, exit this area. Once you buy all of the Pokémon, DJ Arclight will give you a *Lucky Egg*.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Buy all of the seventh street stolen Pokémon (+1 Arclight)

The house above is the Pokémon Psychologist. For just two Heart Scales (which we can find in rocks everywhere) we can change the nature of a Pokémon to whatever we want, meaning we don't need to rely on finding mints anymore. Keep the mints you find though as they can help you switch abilities on the go if you need a speed boosting nature for a specific fight or something similar.

Enter the nearby grotto on the right. Note that there is a sneaky hidden item behind a trainer on the left, so make sure you draw him out at least 1 tile when he notices you in order to get it.

!battle(["Hyde", :StreetRat, 0])

!battle(["Kellam", :COOLTRAINER_Male, 0])

Anyways, hidden in this room is *Black Glasses*, *Red Shard*, and *Exp. Candy XL*.

North of the top tutors, you'll see a shadow indicating an entrance. Inside, talk to the green machine to get a *Synthetic Seed*. Talk to the researcher on the left for a battle.

!battle(["Nadira", :OrderlyF, 0], "Factory Field")

Defeat the researcher in here and agree to participate in her sidequest.

First, you'll need to bring her a Carvanha. Note that these will be gone forever. We can fish one in the nearby Lapis Alleyway. Next, you'll need an Unfezant. You can get Tranquill on the Onyx Rooftop: evolve it at Lv. 31 to get **Unfezant**, then donate it. Finally, we'll need Luxray. You can get Shinx in the Game Corner, evolve it at Lv. 15 then again at Lv. 30 to get **Luxio** then **Luxray**. Donate the latter. Exit Seventh to Lapis Ward, then come back down. Save the game and talk to Nadira. You'll be able to catch **Type: Null**, our first legendary!

On the north side of the main part of seventh, talk to your gang member and he'll mention seeing Bennett in the watering hole. Enter the watering hole, heal if you want, then head out and into the grotto on the right.

!battle(["Celina", :Punk, 0])

!battle(["Yan", :StreetRat, 0])

Grab the hidden *Blue Shard* then talk to Bennett here.

Back outside, a door will be open above you. Head up and to the right. You'll find a mining rock - break it and then use Blast Powder, then pick up the hidden *'Rare Candy'*. Head back to Seventh and it will be stolen! Head all the way to the bottom left of the area and you'll find the thief. Battle him to get it back.

!battle(["Drake", :StreetRat, 0])

Enter the top grotto and give it to a guy to obtain **Piplup**!

Reenter the narrow hole in the wall. You can find hidden *Purple Shard* and *Chewing Gum* as you go left. Enter the room in the bottom left!

## Subseven Sanctum

You'll be moved to a cage. Read the green book here - in fact, read every green book you see around this dungeon. Keep note of what the scripture says as well as the numbers at the end.

Head out once Klefki opens the door. Welcome to Reborn's stealth section!

!img("subseven_mess.png")

In the artistic masterpiece above, the red entities are the guards, as well as their view ranges. The yellow paths indicate the movement patterns and view changes of certain guards, and the blue line represents the path the player must take. I recommend saving often, specifically at the blue blobs. If you get caught, just reload to save yourself the time. You might also want to turn off speed-up.

Enter the door on the right side while traversing the maze. While inside, read these books and grab the *Spell Tag* and *Holy Field Readout*.

Back outside, sneak past the nearby guard by going up at the right time, then go left when you can. You'll notice you can't go too far left, so you'll need to time going down past a patrolling guard, then once he passes you, go up, left, and down so he can't see you anymore. From here, head left once he moves back to the right, but don't go too far left.

Past the locked door on the left, you'll need to go up straight towards a guard who rotates, but you can't see his full sprite. This might take a couple of resets, but you'll need to perfectly time going up and then left based on whether you are seeing the front or back of the legs of the sprite.

Once you take the stairs at the top, the guards will all leave, so you can now navigate this room as you like without getting caught.

In the next room, there are grunts to fight. Going clockwise around the outside of the room first:

!battle(["Lyla", :CultistF, 0], "Holy Field")

!battle(["Kaiden", :Cultist, 0], "Holy Field")

!battle(["Ezra", :Cultist, 0], "Holy Field")

!battle(["Brenda", :CultistF, 0], "Holy Field")

To progress, we'll need to interact with 4 statues and input numbers that correspond to the respective scriptures. In each corner, a statue is protected by a guard. The statue guards, again in a clockwise order from the bottom of the room:

!battle(["Tanner", :Cultist, 0], "Holy Field")

!battle(["Arcturus", :Cultist, 0], "Holy Field")

!battle(["Angela", :CultistF, 0], "Holy Field")

!battle(["Wes", :Cultist, 0], "Holy Field")

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Green: 3827, Blue: 1605, Red: 2303, Purple: 0204
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for the solutions to the statue puzzle</a>
</div>

Enter the codes in each statue, prepare for a battle, then go up towards the middle from the bottom of the room.

!battle(["Ace of Hearts", :ACEHEARTS, 0], "Holy Field")

Another battle with Meteor's Ace themselves, and the first boss fight on the Holy Field. Read up on the Field Notes and you can do it!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Ace Loyalty (+1 Ace, -1 Elias)
- Tell Ace Blood (+1 Elias, -1 Ace)

Back outside in the Beryl Wall, another conversation will occur.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Luna you are afraid of the dark (-1 Luna)
- Tell Luna you aren't afraid of the dark after siding with El (Neutral)
- Tell Luna you aren't afraid of the dark after siding with Radomus (+1 Luna)

You'll then get the *Red Crystal Key*! Don't accept Cain's fast travel request - we can finish a few things up down in Seventh, plus getting to Vanhanen Labyrinth is now easy thanks to the circling Tauros.

## A Cult and a Gang: Sidequests

There are a few sidequests we can take care of in and around Seventh. First, head right back into the Subseven Sanctum and talk to the pentagram thing. With a Soul Candle in our bag, we'll be able to catch **Litwick**.

Back in seventh, the house in the bottom left corner will now be unlocked. If you have a Helix Fossil and do not have a Dome Fossil in your bag, the Twitch Plays Pokémon cultist will ask us to bring a Farfetch'd to him. Do so, and you'll get a choice between the *Sail Fossil* and the *Jaw Fossil*. Since we already have Amaura, no point in getting the former, so pick up the Jaw.

Although we now have both Amaura and a Jaw Fossil, it's worth noting that the cultist will ask for a Pidgeot in exchange for another fossil. Afterwards, you can trade Helix Fossils for more Jaw and Sail fossils if you want more.

Back outside, if you haven't already seen the scene, walk south from the psychologist towards the Pokémon sellers to see Madame Craudberry storm off. Your gang leader will tell you to meet at her house, so exit to Lapis and do so.

!battle(["Craudburry", :HARRIDAN, 0])

If this was a normal Pokémon game, this fight would be pretty hard relative to the others. However this is Pokémon Reborn: her team doesn't even have much synergy. No field, no weather, nothing. Just 5 annoying but beatable EV trained Pokémon.

### The Magma Gang Route (Part 3)

If you are a part of the Aqua Gang, [jump to the next section](#the-aqua-gang-route-part-3)

Head outside, and talk to Maxwell. He will give us *TM11 Sunny Day*. Return to Seventh Street and enter the bottom grotto. Inside, you'll find Archer who you can battle!

!battle(["Archer", :Archer, 1])

Archer uses his rain team once more, but you'll notice it's not really optimized. His Pelipper is the only mechanism to summon rain, and the rest of his Pokémon have no rain-boosted abilities. So it's really just a weak Water-monotype team that you should be able to deal with. Sharpedo can be deadly with Speed Boost and priority, but everything else is slow.

For winning, you'll get *TM18 Rain Dance*.

You'll also notice that since Maxwell is gone from the North Obsidia Ward, you can now grab the hidden *X Attack* behind him and get another Houndour.

### The Aqua Gang Route (Part 3)

If you are a part of the Magma Gang, [jump to the next section](#iolia-valley)

Head outside, and talk to Archer. He will give us *TM18 Rain Dance*. Return to Seventh Street and enter the bottom grotto. Inside, you'll find Maxwell who you can battle!

!battle(["Maxwell", :Maxwell, 1])

Maxwell uses his sun team once more, but you'll notice it's not really optimized. His Ninetales is the only mechanism to summon sun, and the rest of his Pokémon have no sun-boosted abilities past Charizard. So it's really just a weak Fire-monotype team that you should be able to deal with once the sun is gone. Houndoom and Charizard can hit pretty hard but exploiting the team's many weaknesses shouldn't be too tough.

For winning, you'll get *TM11 Sunny Day*.

## Iolia Valley

Head over to Vanhanen Labyrinth. Hidden behind the big tree in the top right is the entrance to Iolia Valley. Talk to the red gem to create a rock smash wall. Head through the path.

!enc(333, ["Grass", "Fishing"], ["Old", "Good"])

In this first area you can find a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Awakening*, and *Blue Shard*. In the bottom left, use the red key once more to open a rock smash wall, then go inside the new cave.

!enc(340, nil, nil, "Iolia Valley Caves")

Exit at the bottom. In the next area, grab the hidden *Purple Shard* then make a new cave entrance. Finally, grab the hidden *Green Shard* and pick up the *Green Crystal Key*.

Make your way all the way back to the entrance of the valley. On the second tier you'll see a glowing green crystal which we can now activate to turn hedges into Rock Smash gems. Sometimes when you smash these, you'll get *Green Shards*.

Go down from here and use the red key to open a new door. Past the cave you can find a hidden *Red Shard* and the *Blue Crystal Key*.

Once again return to the entrance of the valley. Talk to the glowing blue crystal by the water to activate it and make an ice bridge.

On the other side of the water, go up first, then follow the path, using your keys. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Blue Shard* along the way. Activate the green crystal at the end, then return to the ice bridge and go down. Along this path, grab the hidden *Green Shard* and *Magical Seed*. Once you enter your newly created cave entrance, Bennett will confront you.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Bennett you will let him do what he has to (+1 Bennett)
- Tell Bennett you will not let him do what he has to (-1 Bennett)

Grab the *Purple Crystal Key*! Talk to the nearby purple crystal to mutate the cave. Outside the new exit, you can get a hidden *Red-Hots* and *X. Sp Atk*. In the next red cave, use the crystal to mutate another cave. Return all the way to the northmost ice bridge.

Head up and right from here, and enter the cave. Mutate this cave with the purple crystal, then head out the new exit. Pick up the hidden red shard and enter the red cave at the top. Inside, grab the *Dark Memory* and the *Dark Crystal Cavern Field Readout*. If you have Dark Pulse or Night Daze on one of your Pokémon, there is one more thing we can do here. Use it in a wild encounter to transform the Crystal Cavern to a Dark Crystal Cavern to get Sableye. Note that we'll get the former as a TM pretty soon, so you can do this part later if you wish.

!enc(507, nil, nil, "Iolia Valley Northeast Dark Cave")

Back outside, make your way to the entrance to the valley once more. Enter the cave on the second tier, and activate the purple crystal to mutate it. Head back out and enter the cave on the first tier from the left, and head out the newly formed exit. You'll find a *Dusk Stone* and a hidden *Rawst Berry*.

To progress, return to the entrance, un-mutate the cave we just mutated via the second tier, then go through the cave on the first tier once more. Follow this path to a Light Shard, then create another red cave entrance and go in.

!battle(["Bennett", :BENNETT, 1], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Poor guy couldn't even level his Larvesta up once more to have Volcarona. Regardless, he benefits from the field he's on, this time in the form of boosted Signal Beams. Again his bugs are fairly frail and have lots of exploitable weaknesses, so you can use Rock and Fire moves to defeat him.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Bennett on your first try (+1 Luna, -2 Bennett)

## Blast Powder and Crystal Key Goodies

With that, we are able to challenge Luna. There are actually a few things we can do now that we have a few blast powders and the crystal keys. Skip ahead if you just wanna do the fight now.

There should now be a purple warp in Luna's room that will take us to the entrance of Iolia Valley. Convenient!

Head out of Iolia Valley and make your way through South Aventurine Woods to the Tanzan Mountain. Go right when you can into the room that Saphira burst out of earlier. You can use the green key to open a new pathway.

!img("tanzan_east.png")

Hop across some sneaky ledges onto the rocky texture of the cave, then make your way down and to the right. Exit onto the Chrysolia Pass.

Pick up a hidden *Hyper Potion* and *Normal Gem* as you make your way south. In the next two rooms, move boulders out of the way and grab the *Escape Rope*. The large room is a bit harder: you'll need to carefully move boulders and touch all three of the canisters to turn them red without getting stuck. If you need to, you can exit the room to reset. The room looked like this when I solved it:

!img("wasteland_wall_boulders.png")

Once you succeed, exit through the newly opened door. Head down the nearby ladder: this next puzzle will involve pushing boulders down holes to break rocks, and going up ladders. To go up, use the ladders on the left side of the area.

The sequence of steps to finish the puzzle should look something like this:

- Go down the first ladder to the left
- Head to the right and fall down the hole.
- Push this boulder all the way to the right into the hole, then jump down.
- Push the boulder to the right and climb up this ladder.
- To the right, climb the ladder.
- Push the boulder to the left into the hole and follow it in.
- Ignore the boulder on the left, instead go to the right and jump in the hole.
- Go left into the next hole. You'll 'respawn' to the ladder.
- Go to the right and jump twice into the holes.
- Climb the ladder to the right.
- Push this boulder all the way right into the hole, then follow it in.
- Push the boulder to the right side of the ladder, then climb up three times.

Once you finish this puzzle and emerge on top of the wall, head left to get the *Inverse Field Readout*. Right from here, there is a hidden cave entrance behind the canister. Inside, you can get the *Toxic Orb* and *Yureyu Key*. You can also talk to the canister here to fight **Dhelmise**. Exit to Tanzan Mountain... backtracking the entire way.

While we're nearby, head over to Spinel Town. We can revive the Jaw Fossil we got earlier to obtain **Tyrunt**!

The next two have a very high time-taken to value-of-reward ratio... but for completeness I'll get 'em anyways. Our first destination is Byxbysion Wasteland. Using the tunnels, make your way all the way back to the room where we fought Mr. Bigglesworth once upon a time. You can use your Blast Powder to access a *Dawn Stone*.

Secondly, take the boat to Apophyll Beach and enter Apophyll Cave. On the left side you can now use the powder to access a hidden *Max Revive*.

Ok, with those out of the way, head to the Underroot in Beryl. You'll see a green crystal on the right side of the area, so activate it. Cutting some wiggly trees here will allow us to get the *Ampharosite* as well as the *Meadow Plate* and an **Axew** egg. Sweet.

Head over to the Yureyu Abandoned Power Plant where we once fought Shade. Head to the right and around to the top, then use the Yureyu Key to get the *Magnet* and the *Ghostium-Z*. Sweet. Next, head around to the other side of the factory and again use the Yureyu Key to get inside.

!enc(281, nil, nil, "Yureyu Power Plant Backroom")

Each of the Poké Balls in this room is an Electrode. Defeat all of them then talk to the monitor at the top for a battle with **Rotom**.

While we're in the Beryl area, head over to the Beryl Cemetery. If you talked to Simon in the Tanzan Meteor Base, you'll see him here. Talk to him to continue his sidequest - then head down to the building to the right of the Peridot Ward Pokémart to talk to him once more. That's all we can do with this quest for now.

## Eclipse Badge

Return to the Iolia Valley and take the warp to Luna's room.

!battle(["Luna", :LUNA, 0], "Dark Crystal Cavern")

Time to fight Reborn's Dark type gym leader. Offensively, the field will boost the power of Dark Pulse and Night Slash by 1.5x. More notable is that the field boosts the defenses of Dark types by 1.5x, so what'd normally be straightforward super-effective kills on Bisharp, Tyranitar, Absol, Weavile, and Honchkrow now aren't so certain. Not to mention the effect this has on already very bulky Umbreon, who can heal 75% of its health with Moonlight and also boost its Evasion. Plus, they all have perfect IV's and are all EV trained, a feature we'll see sticking around with the boss fights. Anyways, this is a pretty straightforward albeit tough fight that uses offensive and defensive boosts provided by the field pretty well.

The good news is that by this point you should have lots of options to deal with the team. If you want to stay with the Dark Crystal Cavern field, you can use Aurora Veil without needing Hail, or use your own Dark types to get the defense boosts. Dazzling Gleam and Signal Beam get boosted on this field, effectively cancelling out the defenses boost of her team if you use these moves. If you can get around Honchkrow, Fighting types and Bug types with high attack can generally succeed here too in spite of the added defense. You can also take advantage of the fact that she has a singular special move on her entire team and bring a team with lots of Defense to go blow-for-blow.

There are also merits to changing the field. For one, simply by setting sun you'll switch the field to Crystal Cavern, a field which is more neutral and lets you use Dragon type moves more effectively if you'd like. A special shoutout goes to Nature Power which turns into Power Gem on this field, a perfect counter to Sucker Punch Honchkrow. Alternatively, you can use one of the Earthquake-esque moves to switch over to a Cave Field, allowing you to sidestep the enemy bulk and power up Rock moves - only Bisharp resists them. With the Earthquake-esque moves, boosted Rock type moves, boosted Hyper Voice and Boomburst, there are powerful options on Cave. In either case Tyranitar will still be a menace, but can be taken down with a strong Fighting move.

Once you succeed, you'll get the *Eclipse Badge* which boosts our cap to Lv. 70, coincidentally about the point where normal Pokémon games just... end. Plus, she'll give us *TM97 Dark Pulse*! Nice.
