# Episode 12: Demarcation

Exit Luna's gym. **If you head up to the Agate City entrance and go through, we'll actually be locked out from coming back to every area we've been to so far for about 4 badges worth of content.** Before we do so, there are a few sidequests and stuff to grab before continuing.

## 9 Badge Quests

Thanks to the Dark Pulse TM, you can now transform the field in the cave on the eastern side of Iolia Valley to get Sableye a bit easier, so take care of that if you'd like.

Next, make your way to Seventh Street. In the middle of the area you'll see a woman pleading for some medicine for her sleeping husband. Give her the Oddishweed we found earlier in exchange for an egg which will hatch to be **Chespin**.

With that out of the way, if you'd like, take some time to prepare for the next section of the game. Notably we won't have access to the Department Store or the Daycare. We also won't be able to catch new members for our team aside from what's available beyond, so stock up on items and do all the breeding and catching you need to.

Once you're all set, make your way to the Agate City checkpoint north of the Vanhanen Labyrinth, talk to Cain, then head out at the top.

## Agate Circus

After our first introduction to Terra in Agate City... we get to explore the Agate Circus! This area will serve as our "home base" of sorts while we obtain the next few badges. There are trainers scattered about as well as a healing component in the bottom of the area. The trainers on the map, roughly clockwise:

Hidden around the circus, you'll find 3 *Blue Shards*, *Oran Berry*, *Red Shard*, *Full Heal*, *Ultra Potion*, *Escape Rope*, *Purple Shard*, and 2 *Green Shards*.

Starting at the entrance we came in through and working vaguely clockwise, there are tons of things to buy, minigames, etc.

**Agate Circus Cotton Candy Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Cotton Candy* |$5000  |

**Agate Circus General Goods Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|

|*Full Heal*    |$600   |
|*Hyper Potion* |$1000  |
|*Eviolite*     |$20000 |

We can finally buy Ultra Balls! Also, although it's expensive, the Eviolite can turn certain Pokémon like Porygon2 and Dusclops into monsters for this part of the game.

!tutor("Agate Circus Pledge Move Tutor", ["Grass Pledge", "Fire Pledge", "Water Pledge"], ["3 Green Shards", "3 Red Shards", "3 Blue Shards"])

We had access to this in Lapis, but here's one for this section of the game if you need it. There's a Move Relearner in the bottom right corner, again doing it for one Heart Scale per move.

**Agate Circus Friendship Berries**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Pomeg Berry*  |$500           |
|*Kelpsy Berry* |$500           |
|*Qualot Berry* |$500           |
|*Tamato Berry* |$500           |
|*Hondew Berry* |$500           |
|*Grepa Berry*  |$500           |

Just in case you need some.

To the left is a tile puzzle, which you can play in exchange for 1 Green Shard. This is the solution:

!img("carracosta.jpg")

Winning will reward you a *Cover Fossil*. Nearby the healing machine is a candy vendor:

**Agate Circus Candy**

|Item               |Price      |
|-------------------|-----------|
|*Common Candy*     |$150       |
|*Red-Hots*         |$850       |
|*Chewing Gum*      |$800       |
|*Salt-Water Taffy* |$850       |
|*Peppermint*       |$600       |
|*Pop Rocks*        |$750       |
|*Exp. Candy XS*    |$500       |
|*Exp. Candy S*     |$2000      |
|*Exp. Candy M*     |$5000      |
|*Exp. Candy L*     |$10000     |

To the left is another person selling *Ability Capsules* in exchange for 1, then 2, then 3 forevermore of random color shards.

**Agate Circus Balloon Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*Air Balloon*  |$400   |

Next, you'll find an NPC who will change your Pokémon's Hidden Power type in exchange for a Heart Scale. Score another point for Reborn for "actually letting you customize any Pokémon" to let you win with your favorites. Past her is a nickname changer, also obsolete thanks to the party menu.

To the left is another tile puzzle, which you can play in exchange for 1 Red Shard. This is the solution:

!img("archeops.jpg")

Winning will reward you a *Plume Fossil*. Up from here are some tutors.

!tutor("Agate Circus Move Tutor (Bottom)", ["Uproar", "Hyper Voice", "Stomping Tantrum", "Low Kick"], ["3 Blue Shards", "5 Green Shards", "4 Purple Shards", "6 Red Shards"])

!tutor("Agate Circus Move Tutor (Top)", ["Iron Tail", "Focus Punch", "Drill Run", "Synthesis"], ["4 Blue Shards", "3 Green Shards", "4 Purple Shards", "3 Red Shards"])

Down from here there are more stores and such.

**Agate Circus Snax Shop**

|Item           |Price  |
|---------------|-------|
|*PokéSnax*     |$650   |

**Agate Circus Ice Cream Shop**

|Item                   |Price      |
|-----------------------|-----------|
|*Vanilla Ice Cream*    |$400       |
|*Choc Ice Cream*       |$600       |
|*Berry Ice Cream*      |$800       |
|*Blue Moon Ice Cream*\*|$20000     |

The Blue Moon Ice Cream shows up rarely with the same mechanics as before.

There is another tile puzzle here, but this one has different mechanics. I recommend saving beforehand so if you get stuck you don't have to waste a shard when you reset. It costs 1 Purple Shard. Anyways, the finished puzzle looks like this:

!img("conkeldurr.jpg")

Once you win, you'll get a **Timburr**!

Next to this you'll find the High Striker. It costs $350 to play each time.

**High Striker Rewards**

|Reward         |Chance |
|---------------|-------|
|*TM87 Swagger* |2%     |
|**Clefairy**   |14%    |
|Money back     |22%    |
|Nothing        |62%    |

After you've gotten the grand prize, from then on it will be replaced with getting your money back and winning a *Poké Doll*. After getting Clefairy, you will win an actual *Poké Doll* from then on. There's a secret here too: if you do this with a pokemon with Huge Power, Guts, Pure Power, or Sheer Force at the front of your party, you will always get the jackpot!

Once you get a Poké Doll, give it to a child below the healing component to get the *Big Top Arena Field Readout*.

**Agate Circus Power Items Shop**

|Item           |Price          |
|---------------|---------------|
|*Power Weight* |$15000         |
|*Power Bracer* |$15000         |
|*Power Belt*   |$15000         |
|*Power Anklet* |$15000         |
|*Power Lens*   |$15000         |
|*Power Band*   |$15000         |

Enter the gate on the right side that we came in from. Upstairs, a girl will take four Shoal Salts and four Shoal Shells and make us a *Shell Bell*! To her right, there is a clown who gives us a riddle. Solve the riddle for an in-game trade: our Stunfisk for his **Vulpix**!

Back outside, talk to the ringmaster in the upper left corner. Make your way to the cotton candy vendor to get a *Cotton Candy* for free.

Finally, talk to Samson next to the high striker.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Samson as he clears the way, when the player is female (+1 Samson)

Head in to the Big Top, and talk to Aya on the couch. After a conversation you'll get the *Powder Vial*.

Head out, then come back in to have some conversations for relationship points if you'd like.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Aya (+1 Aya)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Cain (+1 Aya)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Ciel (+2 Samson, -1 Ciel)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Speak to Samson (+2 Ciel, -1 Samson)

While we're in the big top, if you talk to a clown in the audience, they'll fight you.

**Clown Darko. Field: Big Top Arena**
- Unown, Lv. 85, @Air Balloon, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
    - Hidden Power
    - Hidden Power
    - Hidden Power
    - Hidden Power

Exit the Big Top. You'll notice another tutor on the left side of the circus.

!tutor("Agate Circus Fake Samson Move Tutor", ["Dual Chop", "Thunder Punch", "Fire Punch", "Ice Punch"], ["4 Blue Shards", "5 Green Shards", "5 Purple Shards", "6 Red Shards"])

Make your way to the bottom left of the circus, grab the hidden *Fighting Gem*, and go in. Inside, a child will ask for a Cotton Candy, then an Air Balloon, then a Poké Doll. Once you give all the items to the kid their scheme will be revealed, and we will get *Department Store Sticker: Clefairy*.

## Clown Indra Fights

Before we proceed, one more thing to note in the circus is the colorful clown in the upper-right part of the area: Clown Indra. Without access to the Grand Hall trainers, he is our best option for grinding. Upon winning, we will get 8 *Exp. Candy L* and a randomly colored *Shard*. Note that he will battle you with a randomly chosen team from a pool which is as follows:

## Route 2

Head up the elevator and walk outside.

**Route 2**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |

|**Rockruff**      |4  |**Machoke**       |4  |**Rockruff**      |4  |
|                  |   |**Rockruff**      |4  |**Absol**         |1  |
|                  |   |**Absol**         |1  |                  |   |

If you go up from here you'll find a hidden *Telluric Seed*, but can't progress farther. So, we'll have to jump over some rocks to the left. Using the cliff and the rocks, you can hop any two-tile-length gaps. Head up once you're in the northern area. You'll notice a green tree and a red tree. The green trees drop Sleep Powder and the red trees drop Rage Powder, both of which can be contained in the Powder Vial. The former can be used to put Crustle to sleep while the latter will wake them up and allow us to battle them! Note that if you hop onto a rock with a narrow base of support, the powder will spill out.

Grab some sleep powder and talk to the rock towards the top to summon a Crustle. Talk to it to put it to sleep, then push it to the right side so that it falls into the hole. A precise guide to moving this first Crustle:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Right 3, Up 1, Right 4, Up 2, Right 3, Up 1, Right 5, Down 2, Right 3
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 1 movements</a>
</div>

Grab some more sleep powder then head to the bottom right corner of this level. You'll find a rock with some stairs that let us climb up onto the rocks, so do so. Hop left then immediately down onto a cliffside. To the left from here you'll find a hidden *Link Stone*. Back near the stairs, make your way to the top left side of this area, carefully avoiding the wobbly rocks. On the higher platform, talk to the rock to summon a Crustle, then push it into the hole at the top of this area. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Left 4, Up 8, Right 1, Up 4, Right 1, Up 3
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 2 movements</a>
</div>

Make your way back down to the larger area, get another dose of sleep powder, then return to the upper left area with the previous Crustle.

Climb onto the white rock via the stairs then go right for a hidden *Ability Capsule*. Go to the left and use the cliff to hop over to the rock face up and to the right. Use the sleep powder on the Crustle in the nearby rock, then push this Crustle off the ledge to the right. This is a bit of a tricky maneuver - keep in mind that you can hop your way around to get a better angle. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Left 2, go up the stairs, hop down, and go down ledges to loop around to get on top of Crustle, Down 1, take the stairs to the left up, hop down, hop your way to the rightmost stairs, Right 3, Down 1.
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 3 movements</a>
</div>

From here, climb the stairs, hop down, make your way down the first ledge on the gray rock face and hop to the right onto the rock with stairs.  You'll need to finish moving the Crustle we previously knocked down the cliff into the hole at the top. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Right 2, Down 1, Right 2, Up 3, Left 1, Up all the way
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 3 movements (pt. 2)</a>
</div>

Climb up the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Ultra Potion* and *Green Shard*.

**Hiker Ike. Field: Rocky Field**
- Camerupt, Lv. 67, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
    - Rock Polish
    - Earthquake
    - Fire Blast
    - Stone Edge

Hop across Crustle to go left at the top. Pick up *TM58 Sky Drop* and a hidden *Super Potion*. To the left across the final Crustle you can get a hidden *Ether* and *Purple Shard*. Head into the mountain here.

**Ametrine Mountain**

|Cave              |%  |Old Rod           |%  |Good Rod          |%  |

|**Sealeo**        |10 |                  |   |                  |   |
|Sandshrew-Alola   |5  |                  |   |                  |   |
|Sandslash-Alola   |5  |                  |   |                  |   |
|**Cryogonal**     |4  |                  |   |                  |   |

Without Surf we can't really do much here other than catch some Water and Ice type Pokémon, so head back out onto Route 2.

Make your way back to the platform with the powder trees by hopping down across two Crustles and going to the left, then hopping your way down and to the right. From the rock with stairs in the bottom right corner, go up and right to hop across to the platform on the right.

Pick up another hidden *Guard Spec.* Down the nearby stairs, you can walk through the valley between the rocks to climb the stairs in the bottom right corner. Up from here, talk to the green part of the locked gate on the right side to open up this shortcut!

To the right from here, go down and grab hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *Revive*. Can't go further, so head back up to the gate, then go down the stairs below.

Grab a hidden *Ultra Ball* then hop across some rocks to the right to grab a *Exp. Candy XL*. Next, hop to the left from the cliff at the top, grab a hidden *PokéSnax*, and hop your way to the bottom right side of the area. Climb down the stairs on the rock.

Snag the *Blue Shard* to the left, then get some sleep powder and talk to Crustle up and to the right. We'll need to move it down and right. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Left 2, Down 1, Right 2, Down 5, Right 3, Down 1, Right 3
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 4 movements</a>
</div>

Down from here, you can hop from the ground onto some reddish rocks. Hop down and to the right to pick up the *Rocky Field Readout*. From here, head back to the previous platform, climb onto the rocks, and make your way all the way back to the shortcut gate. From here, go all the way left.

Go down the stairs here, then pick up a hidden *Red Shard* in this lower area near the green tree. Grab some sleep powder and put the Crustle in the bottom right corner to sleep. We'll need to push it off a cliff down and to the left. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Left 4, Down 4, Left 2, Down 4, Left 1, Down 6, Right 1, Down 8
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 5 movements</a>
</div>

Take the nearby stairs onto the rock and take the path up and left. Get sleep powder up here, then use it on a Crustle in a cave down and to the right. We'll need to get it off of two cliffs. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Left 5, Down 1 off the cliff, Left 4, Down 2, Right 2, Down 1
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 6 movements</a>
</div>

Grab the hidden *Swift Wing, Big Mushroom, Fire Stone*, and *Paralyze Heal* then return to the rock stairs down and right.

Hop to the right this time, taking a stop on the narrow cliffside to the right where you can see two trees. Use the sleep powder on this Crustle and push it off the cliff at the bottom. Precisely:

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    Left 2, Down 5, Right 1, Down 6
  </div>
  <a display="initial" class="spoilerBtn" title="Click to show/hide content" type="button">Click for Crustle 7 movements</a>
</div>

Pick up the hidden *Red Shard* and return onto the top of the rocks. Continue the rock hop up and around to the right. Grab a hidden *Ground Gem*. The path to the right, including a Crustle we placed earlier, is a shortcut that will take us to the start of Route 2. Go down the stairs from here.

In this area, you'll find hidden *Carbos*, *Great Ball*, *Burn Heal*, *Potion*, *X Defend*, *Iron*, *PokéSnax*, *X Sp. Def*, *Revive*, *Escape Rope*, and *Stardust*.

Head into the Fiore Mansion at the top and talk to Amaria. Head upstairs and talk to Hardy on the couch.

Head outside, and you can grab the *Water Surface Field Readout*.

Back downstairs, you'll be given the *Battle Pass - Strike*. With that out of the way, head on back to the circus.

The ringmaster has a team of circus-themed Pokémon that like to use the field effect well! You'll have to watch out for her boosted sound moves like Snarl and Sparkling Aria, as well as Blaziken getting +3 with Swords Dance on top of Speed Boost. If you can manage to not get swept by Blaziken, with some coverage you can probably find a way through this one.

Ooh boy, time for Samson. When I first played Reborn I was stuck on this fight for weeks! For one, 10 of his 24 moves are "high-striker" moves, meaning they get multiplied by a random multiplier between 0.5x and 3x. However, his Hariyama and Conkeldurr are guaranteed high rolls due to their abilities, and any Pokémon with increased attack also has a better chance at high rolls, meaning Synthetic Seed Hawlucha and Blaziken as well as Swords Dance Lucario all get really high rolls! Essentially this means that most of the time you get hit by a high striker move, you are going to be absolutely bodied! On top of this, Lucario's Swords Dance boosts attack by 3 stages per use, and its Acrobatics will hit with 165 base power regardless of item held! With Conkeldurr sitting at 90 total speed to counter Trick Room and Hawlucha with Unburden to outspeed basically anything you have, his team is well suited to deal with all kinds of speed set ups and easily crush your pathetic Pokémon with high striker moves. Thanks to Brick Break, your puny screens will be crushed as well. All in all a tough fight!

Ok, so Samson crushed me when I was younger, but that was before I read the field notes for Big Top Arena and realized how much you can do back to him! If nothing else, notice that what I mentioned about his Lucario's Acrobatics earlier holds true for you as well - the move pretty much wipes his whole team if you are able to use it (or Nature Power, which becomes it). You can also use the High Striker moves yourself to hit hard if you want - notable users include Guts Medicham, Guts / Sheer Force Conkeldurr, and Sky Drop Sheer Force Braviary, all of which are available nearby! There are also a ton of moves that are boosted on this field otherwise: sound moves like Hyper Voice and Boomburst, and other moves like Petal Dance, Power Whip, Fly, and Revelation Dance, to name a few. Speaking of the latter, a Pokémon with Dancer gets +1 Spe and +1 SpA whenever they use a dancing move... a good combo there for a certain Pokémon. If you are able to get away with boosting yourself, Swords Dance, Dragon Dance, and Quiver Dance are all boosted, meaning you can get your own sweeper going fairly easily. Rain lasts 8 turns, Sing has perfect accuracy now, Belly Drum grants defense boosts... there are just so many crazy things that you can use on this field! Even if you don't want to abuse the field, fast Psychic and Flying types are still solid choices to deal with his slower team members and you can always use something like priority moves or Sturdy + Counter for the tricky ones if need be.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Samson on your first try (+2 Ciel)
- Defeat Samson on your second, third, etc. try (-1 Ciel)

Once you win, you'll get the *Strike Badge* and *TM31 Brick Break*.
