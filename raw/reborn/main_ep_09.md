# Episode 9: Sister's Keeper

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Serra on the couch after the battle (+1 Serra)

Exit the gym.

## Two Herbal Extracts

Make your way out of Spinel Town, through the woods, and head back towards Tanzan Mountain. You'll finally be able to enter the Pokémart here! One person sells the now-updated default items, but there is another vendor.

!shop("Default Mart (6-9 Badges)", ["Super Potion", "Antidote", "Paralyze Heal", "Burn Heal", "Escape Rope", "Super Repel", "Poké Ball", "Great Ball"])

!shop("Chrysolia Pokémart Herbs", ["Herbal Extract", "Energy Powder", "Heal Powder"])

The Powders aren't really worth it unless you're going for a Frustration build, but we will need two Herbal Extracts: one for a sidequest and one to continue the story.

If you chose to go to Spinel Town before Belrose Manse, you can [read the above section on Tanzan Cove](#tanzan-cove) for encounters, items, etc.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeated Serra and got Herbal Medicine before entering the Belrose Manse (+1 Charlotte)

Anyways, head to Belrose Manse and go upstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Noel without Herbal Extract in your inventory (-1 Noel)

Give the medicine to Anna and she will feel better. Head outside.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly while Noel wants to battle you (+1 Shelly)

We can talk to Noel to advance the plot, but we can actually use the second Herbal Extract we got right now to get a nice reward, so I'll take care of that now.

Head over to the Chrysolia Forest and go up. You'll find the lady that was teleported off the bench here. Give her the Herbal Extract to get *Department Store Sticker: Chansey*.

!shop("Department Store 7F (Left)", ["Psychic Gem", "Bug Gem", "Rock Gem", "Ghost Gem", "Dark Gem", "Dragon Gem", "Steel Gem", "Ice Gem", "Fairy Gem"])

!shop("Department Store 7F (Right)", ["Fire Gem", "Water Gem", "Normal Gem", "Grass Gem", "Electric Gem", "Poison Gem", "Ground Gem", "Fighting Gem", "Flying Gem"])

You can grab some gems if you have a strategy that relies on them such as Flying-gem Acrobatics or Unburden Normal-gem Fake Out.

With that out of the way, head back to the Tanzan Cove. Prepare your team for a battle and talk to Noel...

## Defending Belrose Manse

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Saphira you don't understand (-1 Saphira)

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Tell Charlotte you want to beat Meteor faces (+1 Charlotte)

The story will diverge a little bit depending on what our choice was at Yureyu. This section gets a bit hairy since there are FOUR different story splits.

### Fought Sigmund at Yureyu Route Part 2

If you didn't fight Sigmund at Yureyu and instead fought Sirius, [jump to the next section](#didnt-fight-sigmund-at-yureyu-part-2).

Anyways, you'll have to first fight two orderlies.

!dbattle(["John", :Orderly, 2], ["David", :Orderly, 1])

Afterwards, you'll be healed but thrust into another battle.

!battle(["Sirius", :Sirius, 1])

On this route this is our first battle with Sirius, and we don't get a partner. His team is all about hitting hard with well-rounded coverage. In particular you have to watch out for his Chandelure, who is fast and can hit most types super effectively. Minior can set up if you have a bad lead against it, and Manectric uses fast offense and pivot moves. The rest are fairly slow. No field effect to worry about here, so pick your best counters to his team and you can overcome.

Afterwards, the game will give us another choice that affects the story! Either we will go upstairs or stay downstairs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Go Upstairs after fighting Sirius (+1 Charlotte, +1 Shelly, +1 Noel, -1 Saphira, -1 Laura, -1 Sigmund)
- Stay Downstairs after fighting Sirius (+1 Charlotte, +1 Shelly, +1 Saphira)

If you chose to stay downstairs the Twins will be captured. Talk to the group in the kitchen to the right.

If you go upstairs, this results in Laura being captured. Talk to Saphira downstairs.

### Didn't Fight Sigmund at Yureyu Part 2

If you fought Sigmund at Yureyu, [jump to the next section](#tanzan-meteor-base).

Anyways, it's time for another battle with the doc.

!battle(["Sigmund Connal", :DOCTOR, 1])

This fight can be tough thanks to his usage of the very broken Psychic Terrain - it will double Musharna's speed, boost his Psychic attacks plus Hex, and make Hypnosis actually reliable. Consider knocking out Musharna, then trying to stall out the terrain to neutralize this strategy; alternatively, you can use Hex yourself to deal heavy damage. In the back is his Electivire, who is fast and hits hard with Ice Punch, so be careful with your Ground types. A well rounded team will be able to succeed with the right approach.

Afterwards, you will make another choice that will affect the game!

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to stop Sigmund after fighting him.**

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Choose to stop Sigmund after fighting him (+1 Saphira, +1 Shelly, +1 Charlotte, +1 Noel, +1 Anna, +1 Shade, -1 Laura, -2 Sigmund)
- Choose to stop Sirius after fighting Sigmund (+1 Laura, -2 Saphira, -1 Noel)

If Saphira was abducted, you'll also see a hole in the wall that opens up. You can actually use the hole instead of the door to enter and exit.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Exit or enter the Belrose Manse through the hole in the wall (-1 Laura)

## Tanzan Meteor Base

With that, we can now enter the Tanzan Mountain and take back whoever you ended up getting kidnapped by Team Meteor.

Head into Tanzan Mountain and go to the right as soon as you can. Depending on your earlier choices either Laura or Saphira will be here. Talk to them and you will be able to use the rock to nicely remove the barrier or freely pass through it after Dragonite destroys it.

The next room contains a hidden *Green Shard*, *Pecha Berry*, and *Blue Shard*. Enter the base.

There will be a lot of these rotary thingies all over the base. Essentially they will send you 90 degrees in the indicated direction, but once you use it, it'll send you in the opposite direction next time. So, you'll only be able to go left for now.

!battle(["Kenneth", :MeteorGrunt, 2], "Factory Field")

Head up and into the room. This next room has tiles that will teleport you to the same color equivalent in a different room - and those in that room will teleport you back. You'll need to reach the top of each room to deactivate a panel. To succeed, one strategy is this:

Use the left panel, then go left, down, up, up and use the computer. Spam down and eventually you can return to the bottom of the room. Ensuring we are starting in the right room this time, use the right panel, then go right, down, up, up, and use this computer. Spam down, again use the white panels at the bottom to pop out in the right side.

!battle(["Brenna", :MeteorGrunt_090, 2], "Factory Field")

Head up via the rotary and go in the door at the top. Use the next rotary to go left.

!battle(["Hilda", :MeteorGrunt_090, 3], "Factory Field")

Head into the room at the bottom.

!battle(["Regina", :MeteorDame, 1], "Factory Field")

Grab *PULSE Readout 7* and return to the previous room. Enter the room to the left.

If anyone except Saphira was abducted earlier, you can fight a few trainers as well as get relationship points here.

!dbattle(["Kenan", :MeteorKnight, 1], ["Diana", :MeteorDame, 1], "Factory Field")

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- After Noel and Anna are abducted, talk to them in the cage (+2 Noel)
- After Charlotte and Shelly are abducted, talk to them in the cage (+1 Shelly, +1 Charlotte)
- After Laura is abducted, talk to her in the cage (+1 Laura)

Return to the previous room, then go up.

!battle(["Coleman", :MeteorGrunt, 3], "Factory Field")

Follow the path down from the rotary.

!battle(["Gretchen", :MeteorDame, 1], "Factory Field")

Continue down. You'll see a purple tile, step on it and you'll end up in the left side of the base again. Once more, go up, this time, you'll be sent up via the rotary. Go left onto the blue tile for now, then the rotary will send you down again. In the next room you'll go to the right this time. You'll get an *Exp. Candy L*! Use the nearby purple tile and you'll emerge on the right side of the area.

!battle(["Ricardo", :MeteorGrunt, 3], "Factory Field")

Enter the room above.

!battle(["Mary", :MeteorGrunt_090, 3], "Factory Field")

Nothing else to do above, so head back down. Enter the room on the right, pick up the *Revive* at the bottom, then talk to Saphira. You'll have to fight two grunts.

!dbattle(["Avril", :MeteorDame, 1], ["Steven", :MeteorKnight, 1], "Factory Field")

Head back to the left and take the rotary to go up.

!battle(["Ringo", :MeteorKnight, 1], "Factory Field")

!battle(["Deryl", :TechNerd, 1], "Factory Field")

!battle(["Rod", :MeteorKnight, 1], "Factory Field")

!battle(["Naoman", :TechNerd, 1], "Factory Field")

Talk to the grunts and scientists up here and talk to the computers to open up the door at the top as well as a shortcut in the bottom-left corner. Talk to Simon here (he won't fight you) to start up a sidequest later.

Enter the door at the top!

## Tanzan Depths

If Saphira was abducted, you'll be here with Laura.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Laura in the depths (+2 Laura)

Go out and head up. 

!enc(247)

You'll see some dialogue. Head down from here, you'll see a new path open up. Follow the new paths that keep opening up until you have to participate in a battle!

!battle(["Gargantuan", :Steelix, 0], "Rocky Field")

Another single Pokémon boss, this time with a Mega Steelix. Since it's slow you can wear it down with Special moves. Counter also works well if you can take a hit.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Steelix on the first try (+3 Saphira, +1 Laura)
- Beat Steelix on the second, third, etc. try (+2 Saphira)

Once you emerge, make your way back into the base and head to the back room. Once you do it will be time for another fight!

!battle(["ZEL", :ZEL, 3], "Factory Field")

Seriously. Thankfully, when you're only fighting one Pokémon with very low HP that has to deal with recharge, you can find a way to open an opportunity to knock it out. Disabling Dark Pulse will let your Ghost type easily win. Alternatively Mirror Coat and Metal Burst can work great here. There's lots of options for this one.

Head all the way back to Tanzan Cove and talk to Anna inside. It's time for another gym battle!

## Standard Badge

!battle(["Noel", :NOEL, 0], "Grassy Terrain")

Shocker, another tough gym leader in Pokémon Reborn. You'll notice that Noel uses Normal types on a field that doesn't really benefit most of his moves, instead, he'll mainly profit off of the free healing each turn. His seeded Clefable, Girafarig, and Bewear in particular are all fairly bulky and have good coverage to mess up your team. With the addition of a Porygon-Z who gets extra bulk thanks to its seed and hits like a truck and the demon spawn known as King's Rock Cinccino, you're in for a tough fight against a well-rounded Normal type team (ok, 5/6 of a Normal type team plus Clefable).

Clefable's Magic Guard is an annoying ability that means you need to overwhelm it physically despite its seed boost or get it before it can Calm Mind too much, but thankfully it means it doesn't have Unaware. This means you can get your own sweeper set up potentially against Bewear or Girafarig and maybe steamroll his team. Fighting types can potentially destroy the Cinccino but won't see a ton of success against the rest of the team. Since Normal types have no other weaknesses, you might have to turn to using the field to your benefit. Although Girafarig has Sap Sipper to absorb Grass type moves, you can go with a hyper-offensive Grass type strategy, keeping Swellow in mind. Coil and Growth are boosted on this field, so it shouldn't be impossible to set up. You can also take advantage of the boost to Fire-moves - in particular Bewear will get crushed by them. Keep in mind too that the Elemental Seed can potentially allow you to more easily survive Cinccino and/or get your own tank set up.

In a pinch, this fight becomes much easier if you change the field to the Burning Field or the Corrosive Field. However, Laura doesn't like you destroying her flower garden!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Noel on Burning Field (-2 Laura)
- Beat Noel on Corrosive Field (-1 Laura)

For winning, you'll get the *Standard Badge* which boosts our cap to 60. We'll also get *TM10 Hidden Power*!
