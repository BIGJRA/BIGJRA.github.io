# Episode 15: Never After

Head back outside. Before we proceed with the story, there's some more mountain action we can do. We've actually only seen like 30% of the massive three-mountain complex; much more of it is now accessible thanks to Waterfall. So, I will cover that in the next section.

## Mountain Range Waterfallin'

Enter Ametrine Mountain 2F via the Route 3 entrance. Surf and climb the nearby waterfall. Upstairs on 3F, you can get a hidden *Green Shard* and *Never-Melt Ice*. Across the ice you can find a hidden *Potion*. On the ice puzzle to the left, creep along the tiles above the ice, then go down onto a rock, left, and up. Grab a hidden *Super Potion*. Head up the waterfall to 4F.

At the top you can grab a hidden *Escape Rope*. Sadly we can't proceed on this route without Rock Climb, so hop down the ledge and make your way down two flights to 2F.

From here, make your way to the waterfall down and left from the Route 2 entrance, then ride down it to Ametrine Mountain 1F. To the right, you'll find a hidden *Purple Shard*, *Escape Rope*, and *Exp. Candy L*. By smashing its favorite rock, you can catch a **Sneasel**.

Surf down the waterfall to the left, then pick up a hidden *Full Heal* on the right. Land on the left side and make your way across the ice. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and push the boulder to the left. Head back up the waterfall, go left, pick up hidden *Paralyze Heal* and *Purple Shard*, then go down at the dive spot.

You'll find a hidden *Blue Shard* in the first room. Notice that there's a hard-to-spot door on the right side of the area - it's a lit alcove you enter from above. These signify going down in level within the mountain (you can check the level you're on by initiating a save from the menu). Inside it, you can find a hidden *Antidote* and *Red Shard*. Surface at the end of the path, and you'll emerge into Ametrine Mountain B1F.

Grab a hidden *Full Heal* and *Health Wing* then proceed to the ice. Make your way to the top right corner of this area, and surf down. Grab a hidden *Water Gem* and climb down the fall to B2F.

In this next room, go left across the ice. Pick up a hidden *Green Shard* and *Pretty Wing*, then climb the waterfalls to the left. In the pool at the top, you can find **Totodile** jumping around. Talk to it while it's in the air for a battle.

Back at the ice puzzle in the room, go up this time. Grab hidden *Stardust* and cross this ice. Before going down the dive spot, go down the fall to get a hidden *Full Restore*. Dive down up above. Grab a hidden *X Sp. Def* on this map and enter the hidden alcove door towards the bottom. In the next room you can get a hidden *Purple Shard* and *Dark Gem*. Surface at the other end and emerge on B3F.

You can get a hidden *Pearl* and *Red Shard* in the next room, as well as *TM01 Work Up* and a *Razor Fang*. Backtrack all the way back to B1F.

This time, cross the ice to the top left. Grab the hidden *Poke Ball* then dive down. Hidden in here are a *Green Shard*, *Genius Wing*, and *Red Shard*. We can also get a *Deep Sea Tooth*. Enter the alcove door at the bottom.

**Ametrine Mountain B2F / Celestinine Mountain B2F Underwater Caverns**

|Land              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Chinchou          |30 |
|Clamperl          |25 |
|**Wailord**       |24 |
|Lanturn           |15 |
|Relicanth         |6  |

In this large room you can get an *Exp. Candy XL* and the *Snorlium-Z* as well as a hidden *Green Shard*, *Water Stone*, and *Super Potion*. Also, specifically on Friday, you can find a **Lapras** roaming around this room!

Enter the hidden alcove door in the lower left side. In the next room you can find a hidden *Green Shard* and *Link Stone*, as well as the *Abomasite*!

With that, backtrack all the way to Ametrine Mountain 1F where we pushed the boulder earlier. Make your way back to the water and ride down some waterfalls until you reach Celestinine Mountain 1F.

From here, go down the waterfall in the bottom right to reach B1F. At the split, go up and grab the hidden *Repel* then dive down.

Underwater, pick up a hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Exp. Candy XL*, *Iron*, and *Clever Wing*. Surface in the bottom left corner and cross the ice to get *TM47 Low Sweep*, then backtrack to the B1F fork.

Go down this time. Pick up a hidden *PP Up* by going up and left, then surf down the waterfall at the bottom. In the right corner you can get a *Potion*, but unfortunately that's all we can do here without Rock Climb.

Backtrack to Celestinine Mountain 1F, then go up the ladder in the upper right side to return to 2F. Follow the path left and  dive down at the crescent shaped spot and surface at the spot in the upper right side. Climb the waterfall here to reach 3F.

On this floor, you'll need to push boulders into the dead ends in order to skate around the entire area. Make sure you're not pushing them into the path - always choose the dead end, and you'll figure this one out. You'll find a hidden *Aspear Berry* within, and a *Exp. Candy L* and hidden *Nugget* in the top left corner. Climb the waterfall to 4F.

**Celestinine Mountain 4F**

|Delibird          |1  |                  |   |

We can fish up an ugly fish on this floor! This room contains a hidden *Flying Gem* and *Green Shard* as well as *TM03 Psyshock*, a *Dragon Scale*, *Timid Mint*, *Water Memory*, and *Exp. Candy XL*.

Backtrack all the way to Celestinine 1F. Go left across the ice to enter Citrine Mountain 1F. Surf straight down, ride down the small waterfall, and pick up a hidden *Green Shard*, *Shoal Salt*, and *PokeSnax*. Push the nearby boulder to the left, then go up the waterfall and cross the now open ice patch.

With the Silver Ring in hand, we can catch Corey's **Skuntank** here! Behind it, pick up the *Silver Card*.

Make your way to Citrine Mountain 2F by climbing the ladder in the top left corner, and climb the waterfall. Pick up the *Prism Scale* and hidden *Common Candy*. Climb the waterfall at the top to reach 3F. Here, you'll find 3 *Exp. Candy XL*, *Amplified Rock*, *Grass Memory*, *TM74 Gyro Ball*, hidden *Super Repel*, *Great Ball*, *Guard Spec.* and *Shoal Salt*. Oh, and you can get Corey's **Mareanie** here!

That wraps up our massive collection effort in the mountain complex. Return to Celestinine Cascade and head down the waterfall when you're ready.

## Water Treatment Center

Talk to Titania here, then enter the North Obsidia Water Grid at the bottom.

**Water Treatment Center**

|Mud Puddles       |%  |Water             |%  |
|------------------|---|------------------|---|
|Gulpin            |45 |Gulpin            |60 |

|**Swalot**        |10 |**Muk-Alola**     |9  |
|**Muk-Alola**     |5  |**Swalot**        |1  |

|Old Rod           |%  |Good Rod          |%  |

|Gulpin            |70 |Gulpin            |60 |
|**Grimer-Alola**  |30 |**Grimer-Alola**  |20 |
|                  |   |**Muk-Alola**     |20 |

In this area, we can hop across piles of trash if they're 2 spaces away. Make your way to the machine to the left - this is a water level machine. Pressing it will lower the water, letting us move trash around and progress. For now, lower the water and make your way to the right. In the very bottom right corner, in the mud, you'll find the *Murkwater Surface Field Readout* hidden behind a pillar. Go up and right to enter the Central Obsidia Water Grid.

Talk to Titania then hop down. If you go left, you can use a panel to open a shortcut.

Talk to Titania a few times in the center if you want.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Give Titania some candy when she says she is hungry (+1 Titania)

Lower the water level, then head down into the mud at the top. Push each of the trash to the right such that you'll be able to hop across them into the upper right area once the water level rises again. Importantly, keep in mind that when the water level rises, the trash will end up one tile higher than they appear to be on when the water level is lowered. Here, the solution is just to push them each right four tiles. Raise the water level when you're done and hop across. Use a panel to make a shortcut and enter the Onyx Water Grid on the right.

In this next room, Titania will be stranded on an island and the water level will be lowered. Push the trash into a position such that Titania will be able to jump across it to the right, then make your way up and to the right.

Raise the water, watch Titania move into a new spot, then lower the water and move the trash to help her go down. Raise the water. Once Titania opens the way, lower the water and go down and left to cross back into the Central Obsidia Water Grid.

Open the gate here. Lower the water level at the center and return to the bottom right corner, going down the stairs and following the path. Push the garbage into place so you can hop across, then raise the water and hop across. Use the panel up here, then lower the water level once more, then enter the door at the bottom left side to enter the Opal Water Grid.

Proceed to the left to enter the Peridot Water Grid. Use the panel here, then lower the water level to the left. Return to Opal Water Grid, go up into the North Obsidia Water Grid, and lower the water level if it is not down already. Move the two piles of trash from their current locations to the left side of the machine so that you can hop to the door at the left. Raise the water level and enter the Peridot Water Grid at this entrance.

Exit out of the door at the top right. Enter the next door and go up to get a *Hyper Potion*. Go back down and left into the Peridot Water Grid. You'll be able to hop across some trash here to get a *Quick Ball* and the *PULSE Readout 3*. You can also talk to the shutter here to open a door at the top of this room.

Enter this new room in the top right corner, and grab a hidden *Cell Battery*. In the top right is an *Electirizer*. Exit and re-enter, and now there will be an Electrode in the corner. Battle it and transform the Short-Circuit Field into Factory Field. Talk to the nearby machine to get **Fennekin**!

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Read the note that comes with Fennekin (+1 Ace)

Return to the previous room. Enter the Lapis Water Grid via the door to the left, then head up the left side.

Make your way to the water machine and go down the stairs directly below you to the mud. If you sneak past the trash to the bottom left you can get a *Smoke Ball*. Next, push the four rightmost trash to be all in a line, separated by two between each and such that the middle two surround the white pipe.

Raise the water level, and you should now be able to hop across them altogether. Head to the top right corner.

Unlock the shutter, lower the water, and grab the *Beryl Grid Key*.

Return to the Peridot Grid and cross the mud. On the bottom left side of the map, you'll stairs leading onto the mud, which eventually lead you to a hidden *Black Sludge*. Cross to the left into the Jasper Water Grid.

Head left, then follow the path when the water is lowered. Go down onto the bottom section of the mud and go left to get a hidden *Full Heal*. Back on the land, go left.

Proceed into the door to the Beryl Water Grid at the top with your key. Go to the right, and Titania will get trapped. Head left and go down the stairs. Move the two trashes such that you can hop across up and right. Titania will help us out by raising and lowering the water level as we go, so don't worry. In the next area, push the garbage such that you can go across to the left.

Go down from here and follow the path through some rooms to the right, opening shutters for shortcuts as you go.

**Pokemon Stopple. Field: Murkwater Field**
- PULSE Swalot, Lv. 80, @Black Sludge, Ability: Water Absorb, Calm Nature, IVs: 27, EVs: 252/0/252/0/4/0.
    - Sludge Wave
    - Recover
    - Infestation
    - Discharge

PULSE Swalot is slow but extremely bulky, and also has not 1, not 2, but 3 separate ways to heal - Recover, Black Sludge, and healing via its ability on the field. It also is Poison type, so you can't use Toxic and wait like you could with Avalugg. It also hits respectably hard, and thanks to Discharge paralysis and Infestation flat damage, so you're likely going to have a hard time trying to get your own tank set up against it.

I recommend trying to neutralize its healing - Knock Off or Trick with a Sticky Barb, Gastro Acid or Entrainment, Heal Block or Taunt are all options that can successfully prevent it from getting HP back. Then, you can exploit the fact that Electric moves are boosted on this field to finally knock it out!

Once you win, the Water Treatment Center's purification mechanisms will get fixed, but we'll need to make the water level in every single room rise to make it clean again. To start, raise the water level nearby! You'll see the room change to blue on the nearby map.

Note that the normal water can be surfed on! Head east into the Central Obsidia Grid and fix the water level in here. Note you can surf to the right now to get *TM67 Smart Strike*.

Enter the Coral Water Grid in the bottom right. Fix the water, then enter the Onyx Grid at the top. Fix the water in here, then surf to the top of the room to get *TM93 Wild Charge*. Walk all the way back to the North Obsidia Grid.

Fix the water here, head left into the Peridot Water Grid, and raise the water level once more. Head up into the Lapis Grid and fix the water. Fix the Jasper Grid's water, grab the *Scope Lens*, and finally return to the Beryl grid. Talk to Titania in the upper right corner. Surf to the top left corner of the room and proceed through all the barriers, then free Titania below. Use the Light Shard and go in.

You'll have a decision to make.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to NOT battle Taka.**

All of the other choices we've made so far actually pale in comparison to the butterfly effect that comes following this choice. For reasons that will become clearer later on, the results of choosing to fight Taka are called the *Zekrom Route* and the results of choosing to not fight Taka are called the *Reshiram Route* by the community. This guide will also use these conventions.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Fight Taka (+2 Taka, +1 Ace, -1 Titania)
- Don't Fight Taka (+1 Anna, +1 Shade, -1 Ace, -2 Taka)

### Zekrom Route Taka Fight

If you're on the Reshiram route, skip ahead to the next section.

    - Hyper Voice
    - Roost

Time for another fight with Taka, but he doesn't have a particularly tough team this time. If you have something to deal with his lead, an Ice type or two can basically steamroll his team.

### Ace Fight

Regardless of your route you'll have to fight Ace.

**Meteor Agent Ace of Spades (Max Potion). Field: Factory Field**
- Roserade, Lv. 70, Ability: Technician, Rash Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 4/0/0/252/0/252

    - Earthquake
    - Iron Head
    - Zen Headbutt
    - Bullet Punch

Time for another fight with Ace. This time they use a field that's fairly well designed for the Factory and Short-Circuit fields, thanks to multiple Steel and Electric moves. They also have Roserade, Zoroark, and Delphox to complete the well rounded squad. Flying and Ground moves together hit 5/6 of their Pokemon super-effectively, so if you can manage speed and exploit these weaknesses, you will likely find a way to succeed.

After this fight, return to the front of the Water Treatment Center and climb the waterfall.

## Fiore Mansion Gauntlet

Make your way towards the Fiore Mansion, and you'll meet up with some old characters and obtain *TMX2 Fly*! About time. Heal and prepare your team and then head in... we have a huge Gauntlet coming up! Thankfully, this one will heal us between each fight.

This first fight is a 12v9 against some grunts. Florinia is pretty helpful here, and none of their Pokemon are too strong. It's more of a warmup fight.

This battle in the gauntlet is a bit harder. Florinia has a lot of good matchups damage-wise against Fern and Blake, you just have to make sure she's able to attack them before they take her out. Since Florinia's team is so slow, I really recommend using Trick Room in this fight. If you can ensure Scizor and Weavile get knocked out, you won't have to worry about priority, so you can generally overrun their teams with strong super-effective moves. You might also want to consider screens to keep your side safe from OHKOs.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Florinia joins your team after you did not defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Florinia)
- Julia joins your team after you did defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Julia, -1 Fern)

The hardest battle in this gauntlet is the last one. On one hand, Solaris' team basically consists of six classic OU threats. On the other hand, John's team consists of some slower and less powerful Pokemon, but which have wider coverage, a bit more defensive stats, and some support moves. Nothing on their side is entirely dead weight really, and since you only get to control the actions of one of two of the Pokemon on your side, it is tougher to use doubles strats to gain momentum.

If you defeated Solaris on Pyrous, you'll have Julia as a partner, who sadly doesn't have a very good time overall against the pair thanks to their numerous Ground and Electric types, though she can help against some of the Flying types. Not to mention her Rotom Fan, who holds an Air Balloon... Otherwise, you'll have Florinia as a partner once more, making Trick Room more potent and allowing her to do a decent amount of the work. With the 12v12 format, things can change dramatically depending on what the pairings happen to be at any given moment, so it may require some luck to have the right one of your partner's Pokemon out at the right time. If you have to quit to change up your team, you'll have to fight the first two trainers again, so keep that in mind.

After these events finish playing out, head outside of the building and talk to Titania. Return to the circus!

Talk to Samson. You'll be given the *Battle Pass - Suspension*. Sweet. Save, then talk to Ciel when you're ready for another gym battle!

Ciel is the first fight for a badge that repeats a field used by another, but the fight plays out very differently. Many of the strategies I recommended to beat Samson are employed by Ciel against you in this fight. The emphasis is no longer on High Striker moves - Altaria, Minior, and Gliscor have Earthquake, and that's it. Instead, she relies on super-boosted Acrobatics, Revelation Dance, and sound-based moves that dazzle the crowd and gain power. Oh, and she has the first enemy Mega Pokemon we have to face in Mega Altaria.

Similarly to Samson, you can win by just exploiting this field's many effects. Just as I recommended using Acrobatics and Revelation Dance against Samson, it could be really funny to use your own High Strikin' Pokemon with Smack Down and Earthquake, since her team past Gliscor doesn't have a ton of defense. Nothing on her team resists Acrobatics, so you can beat her with her own strategy. Electric type Revelation Dance can rip through all but Gliscor and Altaria pretty easily if you have an Oricorio yourself. You can also just use Trick Room and a couple slower Ice and Rock types to bowl over her team.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Ciel on your first try (+2 Samson)
- Defeat Ciel on your second, third, etc. try (-1 Samson)

For winning, you'll get the Suspension Badge, boosting our cap to a whopping Lv. 80! You'll also get *TM62 Acrobatics*. Useful. Most importantly though, we can now Fly, meaning we can once more return to Reborn City.
