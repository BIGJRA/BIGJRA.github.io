## Custom Pokémon Form Lookup

Pokémon Reborn uses Gen 7 Pokémon, forms, and mechanics. Details for all canon forms can be found on [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) or your favorite Pokémon Database. However, these resources will not have any information on Reborn's custom forms.

While Pokémon Reborn doesn't have any entirely new Pokémon, it does include new forms for many Pokémon. Aside from the Aevian forms, all of these are not available to the player and are instead boss Pokémon. I include full details for these below. Note that these forms can be considered spoilers!

Any attributes that are not listed are unchanged from the base form.
