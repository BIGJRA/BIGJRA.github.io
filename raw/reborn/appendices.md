## Custom Pokemon Form Lookup

Pokemon Reborn uses Gen 7 Pokemon, forms, and mechanics. Details for all canon forms can be found on [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) or your favorite Pokemon Database. However, these resources will not have any information on Reborn's custom forms.

While Pokemon Reborn doesn't have any entirely new Pokemon, it does include new forms for many Pokemon. Aside from the Aevian forms, all of these are not available to the player and are instead boss Pokemon. I include full details for these below. Note that these forms can be considered spoilers!

Any attributes that are not listed are unchanged from the base form.

The following table lists the chances of each item being generated in a mining rock:
