# Episode 7: Poison In Vain

Take the yacht to Azurine Island.

## Azurine Island

!enc(206, nil, ["Old"])

With that, we can start to explore this island. Note that many item balls are Foongus in disguise.

The first island has a *Potion* and hidden *Pretty Wing*. The next area contains a *Great Ball* and hidden *Hyper Potion*. Before cutting the tree go to the left across the moss to get a hidden *Red Shard* and *TM83 Infestation*.

Cut the tree and go right. Before going down the ledge you can get an *Antidote* as well as hidden *Ice Gem*, *Resist Wing* and 2 *TinyMushrooms*. You'll find a hidden *Purple Shard* below.

On the next island to the right, you can find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Red Shard*, and *Synthetic Seed*. Following the path behind the Foongus in the bottom left you can get a *Shiny Stone*.

Back up from here, cross to the right. You can find a hidden *Green Shard* on this island. At the top left there is a path across the water that will lead to a hidden *Thunderstone*.

Head down the ledge on the east island. You can find a hidden *Swift Wing* here and follow the ivy up from here to get the *Swamp Field Readout*. Briefly stopping on the middle island, head down using the ivy to pick up a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* then head left.

You can head down as soon as you touch land to get a *Miracle Seed*. Back on land, you'll find a hidden *Great Ball* and *Guard Spec.* Use the Light Shard and head left. Before continuing left to the next island, you can go down via the ivy to find one hidden *Dusk Ball* and one non-hidden *Dusk Ball*. Head up and left when you're ready.

!battle(["Aster", :AsterKnight, 3], "Swamp Field", ["Eclipse", :EclipseDame, 3])

Another battle with Aster and Eclipse, this time featuring a full team. Solrock and Lunatone are somewhat slow and have many weaknesses. The Lycanrocs and Passimian are speedy and hit hard, but after a few turns they'll all become slowed down by the field, allowing you to capitalize on their low bulk. Oranguru likes to use Instruct and/or hit both of your Pokémon with Nature Power into field-boosted Muddy Water, so be careful of that.

Left from here you'll grab a hidden *Potion*, *Tiny Mushroom*, *Ether*, and *Escape Rope*. Cut the tree up from here to get another hidden *Tiny Mushroom*. Go down from here. You'll find a *Magical Seed* and hidden *Purple Shard*. Head down and right to grab a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* and a hidden *Green Shard* a bit further... and we can finally enter the building here.

Pick up the *PULSE Readout 6* and talk to the machine in the top to reveal a secret passageway. Heal or switch up your team and go up.

!battle(["Taka", :Taka, 1], "Factory Field")

Time to fight Taka again. Although he has added Klefki and Gligar to his team, neither should be too threatening. Just be careful of Exeggutor hitting hard with its STABs and Nature Power -> Gear Grind, and also Chatot setting up on you.

Accept Cain's fast travel request.

## The Battle for Apophyll

Once you're back on Apophyll, prepare your team. It's worth pointing out that winning the upcoming boss battle  is optional, but there are strategies to win if you're interested. Head down to Pyrous Mountain.

Head in and you'll be partnered up with Victoria.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Try to leave Pyrous while partnered with Victoria (-2 Victoria)

**Meteor Grunt Ama & Meteor Grunt Christopher. Field: Super-Heated Field**
- Noctowl, Lv. 39, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Dodrio, Lv. 39, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Klang, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Gabite, Lv. 39, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Shuckle, Lv. 39, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Doublade, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Anyways, if you haven't explored Pyrous yet now you'll have to, so follow the directions in the above Pyrous section if you'd like. If you have, you just have to make it back up to the peak using the straightforward path, beating grunts as you go. To the left:

**Meteor Grunt Antoine & Meteor Grunt Demian. Field: Super-Heated Field**
- Mightyena, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Liepard, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Venomoth, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Graveler, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

On B1F:

**Meteor Grunt Minta & Meteor Grunt Chad. Field: Super-Heated Field**
- Hariyama, Lv. 39, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Sudowoodo, Lv. 39, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Haunter, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Venomoth, Lv. 39, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Pignite, Lv. 39, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Fearow, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Back on 1F, following the path up the mountain:

**Meteor Grunt Michaela & Meteor Grunt Winter. Field: Super-Heated Field**
- Skuntank, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Minior, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Metang, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

- Lunatone, Lv. 40, Serious Nature, IVs: 10
- Heliolisk, Lv. 41, Serious Nature, IVs: 10

Once you reach the peak, it's time for that boss battle I was talking about.

**In order to access the exclusive postgame route, you need to win this battle.**

**Meteor Leader Solaris (2x Full Heal). Field: Super-Heated Field**
- Garchomp, Lv. 75, @Leftovers, Ability: Rough Skin, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Dragon Rush
    - Earthquake
    - Fire Fang
    - Stone Edge

This is an "impossible battle" in the normal sense that the story will progress if you lose, but it actually does acknowledge your success with being a precondition for one of the postgame routes as well as some points. For that reason I will hide the text on my recommendations.

<div class="spoilerDiv">
  <div class="spoilerText" style="display:none">
    You won't have an easy time with status conditions thanks to the Full Heals. There are still numerous things you can do here. The Focus Sash is always an option - putting it on a Counter Pokémon or something with attack-lowering moves can open it up to not kill some of your Pokémon. For an easier time, Bastiodon and Sudowoodo both get Sturdy and Metal Burst / Counter, Sharpedo can Speed Boost and use Destiny Bond, Murkrow can use Prankster Perish Song... the possibilities for this fight are vast.  </div>

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Solaris on Pyrous (+1 Cain, +1 Victoria, +1 Cal, +1 Shade, +1 Anna, +3 Taka)

## Byxbysion Wasteland

Head to the eastern side of the South Obsidia Ward. Talk to Cain to enter the Byxbysion Wasteland.

**Byxbysion Wasteland**

|Land (Morning)    |%  |Land (Day)        |%  |Land (Night)      |%  |

|Geodude           |60 |Pineco            |75 |
|**Nincada**       |35 |Unown             |15 |
|Graveler          |5  |**Inkay**         |10 |

In this first area you can find 2 hidden *Blue Shards*, *Green Shard*, *Potion*, *Telluric Seed*, and *Poison Gem*. Follow the ledge at the bottom and pick up a hidden *Full Heal* and *Red Shard*. A nearby slide will take you to a hidden *Green Shard* and *Escape Rope*. Read the grave while you're here to initiate a quest.

Enter the building and emerge at the top. On this upper platform you can find a hidden *Green Shard*. The slide to the left leads us back to the first area, so don't take that. Instead, go up from the statue and hop down the ledge, in the top left corner. You'll find hidden *Genius Wing*, *Ability Capsule*, *Green Shard*, *Ultra Ball*, and *Carbos*. In the top right side there is a canister you can talk to that will turn red - we will need to do this to multiple canisters across the wasteland to access a secret area. In the top left corner of this area you can enter a cave. Following it to the left and out you can get a hidden *Cotton Candy*. Back through the cave, go down and left, then down the ledge. Make your way back down the ledge and slide to reach the building with the stairs and emerge at the top.

Take the slide to the right now. You can find hidden *X Defend*, *X Speed*, *Hyper Potion*, *Exp. Candy L*, *Poké Ball*, *Purple Shard*, *Green Shard*, *Poison Barb*, *Purple Shard*, and *Protein*. Up from here you can find another canister to turn red. Up and to the left you can go through a building to find a hidden *Black Sludge*. Head to the bottom left of this segment. Hop down one ledge. Here you'll find another canister to turn red, the *Wasteland Field Readout* hiding behind a rock as well as hidden *Blue Shard* and *Peppermint*. From here you'll have to go back through the building and down the right slide to return to this area.

In the bottom right section, use the Light Shard and talk to Ace for a battle.

**Meteor Agent Ace of Diamonds (Hyper Potion). Field: Wasteland Field**
- Zoroark, Lv. 41, Ability: Illusion, Jolly Nature, IVs: 20
    - Swagger
    - U-turn
    - Punishment
    - Low Sweep
- Clefable, Lv. 41, @Sitrus Berry, Ability: Magic Guard, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Belly Drum
    - Drain Punch
    - Ice Punch
    - Meteor Mash
- Honchkrow, Lv. 41, @Enigma Berry, Ability: Super Luck, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Sucker Punch
    - Heat Wave
    - Steel Wing
    - Drill Peck
- Bronzong, Lv. 42, @Telluric Seed, Ability: Levitate, Brave Nature, IVs: 25
    - Gyro Ball
    - Zen Headbutt
    - Toxic

- Delphox, Lv. 43, Ability: Magician, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Mystical Fire
    - Psyshock
    - Thunder Punch
    - Foul Play

Ace has a full team but it isn't particularly bolstered by the field. Be careful not to let Honchkrow or Clefable sweep you and I'm sure you can find a way through this fight.

Talk to the screen beyond them to unlock a door down and to the right. Exit the building at the top and go down the first slide. You'll find a *Lax Incense* up here. Go down the slide to the left. You'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Heart Scale*, and *Calcium*, as well as another canister to turn red. Down the ledge, you'll need to go through the building again. Take the slide on the right now, and grab the hidden *Potion*.

In the top right corner of the area, you can find hidden *Ground Gem*, *Purple Shard*, *Ether*, and *Ice Heal*. Talk to the final canister to turn red.

Talk to Cain if you'd like then enter the building. Heal and prepare your team, save, then enter the room on the left.

**Swag Jockey Fern (2x Choc Ice Cream). Field: Wasteland Field**
- Rhydon, Lv. 43, @Muscle Band, Ability: Reckless, Brave Nature, IVs: 25
    - Stone Edge
    - Drill Run
    - Chip Away
    - Fire Fang
- Krookodile, Lv. 43, Ability: Intimidate, Adamant Nature, IVs: 20
    - Fire Fang
    - Dig
    - Crunch
    - Thunder Fang
- Scyther, Lv. 43, @Muscle Band, Ability: Technician, Adamant Nature, IVs: 25
    - X-Scissor
    - Double Team
    - Slash
    - Wing Attack
- Fraxure, Lv. 42, Ability: Mold Breaker, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Taunt
    - Dual Chop
    - Dragon Dance
    - Stomp Tantrum
- Roserade, Lv. 44, @Leftovers, Ability: Poison Point, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sleep Powder
    - Giga Drain
    - Extrasensory
    - Hidden Power
- Decidueye, Lv. 45, @Lum Berry, Ability: Long Reach, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31
    - Leaf Blade
    - Swords Dance
    - Sucker Punch
    - Spirit Shackle

Fern is back with a full team. His general strategies remain the same: Krookodile will try to sweep, Roserade will hit hard and fast with Giga Drain to heal itself, and Decidueye will try to Sucker Punch you and/or sweep with Swords Dance. Scyther hits fairly hard with its STABs, especially Technician Wing Attack. Fraxure and Rhydon aren't as bad but you still have to be careful.

Past the Ground types, a Poison type can abuse the field to sweep the fight. Nature Power turns into Gunk Shot and, as an added bonus, is immune to Sucker Punch. Once you can get past Roserade he doesn't have an incredible amount of speed so a boosted sweeper can probably succeed here.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat Fern on the first try (+1 Aya, +1 Hardy)

Before doing the gym battle, there is some side content. Turn all the canisters in the wasteland red if you want to explore the Byxbysion Tunnels.

## Byxbysion Tunnels

Head down from the wasteland hideout, smash the rock and go down the ledge. You'll see that the left building door is now open.

**Hidden Tunnel / Byxbysion Grotto / Byxbysion Tunnels 1**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Zubat             |30 |
|Trubbish          |20 |
|**Solosis**       |20 |
|Koffing           |10 |
|Onix              |10 |
|Mawile            |6  |
|Golbat            |4  |

The tunnel is straightforward - enter the cave entrance at the end to reach another tunnel.

**Byxbysion Tunnels 2**

|Cave              |%  |
|------------------|---|
|Trubbish          |20 |
|Zubat             |20 |
|Nidoran M.        |15 |
|**Nidoran F.**    |15 |
|Solosis           |10 |
|Koffing           |10 |
|Nidorina          |5  |
|**Nidorino**      |5  |

Emerge on the other side and go down the slide. Grab a hidden *Synthetic Seed* and go down the next slide. Here a guy will tell you about the password *nodamageroll*. Grab a hidden *Red Shard* and enter the next cave. Follow the path through to the outside. The next area will have a hidden *Sticky Barb* and *Full Heal*, and a *Poison Barb* to the right. Enter the next cave entrance.

Interact with both canisters to move the bookshelf at the top, revealing a secret room. Inside it, you can find a hidden *Sun Stone*.

Inside the room to the left, you can use an Odd Keystone if you've found one via mining to get **Spiritomb**. The second room contains *TM66 Payback*. Prepare yourself and enter the third room.

**Pokémon Horde. Field: Wasteland Field**
- Trubbish, Lv. 30, Ability: Aftermath, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Toxic Spikes
    - Sludge Bomb
    - Self-Destruct
    - Acid Spray
- Trubbish, Lv. 30, Ability: Aftermath, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Toxic Spikes
    - Sludge Bomb
    - Self-Destruct
    - Acid Spray
- Mr. Bigglesworth (PULSE Garbodor), Lv. 65, @Black Sludge, Ability: Stench, Adamant Nature, IVs: 31, EVs: 252/252/4/0/0/0
    - Gunk Shot
    - Pain Split
    - Stockpile
    - Drain Punch

Mr. Bigglesworth is tough and also our first opponent that is EV trained. You can set up while the Trubbish are out with your own Steel or Poison type then destroy him. Sad :(

Behind you'll find *TM09 Venoshock* as well as the *PULSE Readout 0*.

That's it for this part, so return to the room with the two canisters. Hidden behind the left one is another tunnel. As you follow the path you can get a hidden *Focus Sash*. Nice.

Once you appear outside, go down the slide here and grab a hidden *Moon Stone*. Go in the cave and head up the ladder, then go right back down this ladder to reach a new area...? This doesn't really make sense, but neither does much of the wasteland, really. The mining rock here is all we can get right now, so head up the ladder, go down the slide, and then make your way all the way back to the Wasteland hideout.

## Blight Badge

Enter the gym room, save, and talk to Aya.

**Wasteland Punk Aya (2x Hyper Potion). Field: Wasteland Field**
- Nidoqueen, Lv. 41, @Black Sludge, Ability: Poison Point, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sludge Wave
    - Stealth Rock
    - Crunch
    - Stomp Tantrum
- Toxapex, Lv. 41, @Black Sludge, Ability: Merciless, Calm Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sludge Wave
    - Recover
    - Icy Wind
    - Toxic Spikes
- Venusaur, Lv. 42, Ability: Overgrow, Bashful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Stomp Tantrum
    - Power Whip
    - Nature Power
    - Leech Seed
- Drapion, Lv. 42, @Muscle Band, Ability: Battle Armor, Careful Nature, IVs: 31
    - Knock Off
    - Fire Fang
    - Cross Poison
    - Aqua Tail
- Salazzle, Lv. 42, @Focus Sash, Ability: Corrosion, Timid Nature, IVs: 31
    - Nasty Plot
    - Heat Wave
    - Sludge Wave
    - Disable
- Dragalge, Lv. 45, @Black Sludge, Ability: Adaptability, Modest Nature, IVs: 31
    - Sludge Wave
    - Shadow Ball
    - Hydro Pump
    - Dragon Pulse

Aya is another difficult doubles gym leader. For one, the field boosts her all-target Sludge Waves as well as Venusaur's Power Whip. Entry Hazards are all turned into end-of-turn effects: Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rocks will do damage and the former will Poison your Pokémon. With the speedy Nidoqueen and Salazzle, the bulky Toxapex and Dragalge, and Venusaur and Drapion for coverage, her team is well suited to deal with many of the strategies you might think to use. Plus, while you'd immediately think Earthquake is a good answer, the move's damage is quartered on this field, so that's not really an option.

The key to this battle in my experience is letting Toxapex hang out on the left side, especially if you can lower its Special Attack or put it to sleep.  Toxapex does have Merciless which is always on, but still doesn't hit incredibly hard and will probably be going last unless it has gotten off a lot of Icy Wind. With two moves per turn focusing on the Pokémon to its right, you may be able to preserve momentum long enough to come out on top. For that reason, putting Psychic type attackers, and/or Steel/Poison type defenders on the field and letting them tank attacks and knock out the threats will probably pay out. Ice is also a pretty good offensive type here, note that Freeze Dry can take four of her Pokémon super-effectively and the other two neutrally. You can also use your own entry hazard spam, standard doubles strategies like Wide Guard and Protect, or the Telluric seed to boost a sweeper.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Beat Aya on the first try (+1 Hardy, +1 Fern)

Once you win you'll get the *Blight Badge*, *TM34 Sludge Wave*, and get a Level 50 cap finally. We also get to use Strength in the field, finally!
