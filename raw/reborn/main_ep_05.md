# Episode 5: Escape! from Reborn City

Head outside the gym after watching the scene in Shelly's room. After you head outside, you have another rival battle.

!battle(["Cain", :Cain, 2])

This battle probably won't be too tough if you could defeat Shelly. Nidoking hits hard, but it still has fairly weak STAB attacks. Defeat him with your best strategies.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Agree to save Heather (+1 Cain)
- Refuse to help Heather (-1 Cain)

With that, Cain and Shelly will head over to the Orphanage.

## Lapis Ward Orphanage

Head into the Orphanage as soon as the door opens. You'll be paired up with either Cain or Shelly depending on who you have more relationship points with at this moment.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Defeat the Orderlies with Cain (+1 Cain)
- Defeat the Orderlies with Shelly (+1 Shelly)

!partner(["Cain", :Cain, 2])

!partner(["Shelly", :SHELLY, 1])

!battle(["Timothy", :Orderly, 0], nil, ["Chris", :Orderly, 0])

After this fight, you'll be free to explore with Shelly (above) as a partner. Keep in mind though:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Leave the Orphanage while partnered (-1 Cain, -1 Shelly, -1 Charlotte, -1 Noel, -1 Heather)

You can also gain points:

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Shelly while partnered (+1 Shelly)

We can now choose where to go.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Enter the hallway first before exploring upstairs (-1 Shelly)

So, we're gonna head upstairs first. Defeat orderlies as you go up.

!battle(["Allyssa", :OrderlyF, 0], nil, ["Stephanie", :OrderlyF, 0])

!battle(["Bishop", :Orderly, 0], nil, ["Roth", :Orderly, 0])

You'll be prevented from continuing upstairs, so head downstairs and talk to Anna again.

Enter the open door on the first floor. Be careful about trying to enter the doors on the left.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- The Player is male and tries to enter the Girls' Bathroom two times (-1 Shelly)

Beat the orderlies in the room above.

!battle(["Howaya", :Orderly, 0], nil, ["Callie", :OrderlyF, 0])

You can read the green books for some background on the new characters. Back outside, head down and to the left.

!battle(["Danielle", :OrderlyF, 0], nil, ["Ramsey", :Orderly, 0])

Pick up a *Data Chip* down here. Talk to the green computer screen nearby to open a lock.

Head back upstairs and go through the now-opened path.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Ignore Noel in the cage (-1 Noel)

Defeat the orderlies upstairs.

!battle(["Charity", :OrderlyF, 0], nil, ["John", :Orderly, 1])

Open the patient cages. You can find a hidden *Great Ball* here. Head downstairs and grab the *Paralyze Heal* on your way down.

On the first floor, enter the room on the right.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Talk to Charlotte twice while she's in a cage (-2 Charlotte)

Unlock Charlotte's cage. If you unlock the cage on the right the kid inside will give you 4 *Exp. Candy M*.

!battle(["Christina", :OrderlyF, 0], nil, ["Matt", :Orderly, 0])

Defeat some orderlies, then at the bottom grab the *Odd Incense* and the *Archive Key*, which is hidden behind the foliage of the right plant.

Back in the left hallway, use the *Archive Key* to grab an *Exp. Candy L* and read some more books about the orphanage's characters. With that, head all the way up to the top of the orphanage to bust out.

!battle(["Sigmund Connal", :DOCTOR, 2])

You'll notice that the doctor has a strong team full of Electric and Psychic types. Electivire will often pivot to Musharna, who will use Psychic Terrain, guaranteeing it, Hypno, and Raichu huge bonuses. You can try to use your own Psychic attacks on the terrain against the electric types if you'd like, you can also stall out the Terrain if it is too much to handle. This can be a tough fight but you can find a way through!

Outside, accept Anna's request for fast travel. We'll find ourselves back in the Underground Railnet. Head to the east and smash the rock to progress.

!enc(196)

You can also find a hidden *Pecha Berry*, *Carbos*, *Purple Shard*, *Red Shard*, and *Fire Gem* here. In the bottom right corner you can get the *Dull Key*. Open the gate on the right for a shortcut, then talk to the group at the top. Sounds like we're going to be taking on another gym leader soon, but before that there are tons of areas we can now access thanks to Rock Smash. Oh, and we get to strike at the heart of our enemy gang.

Make your way over to the Opal Bridge. As you make your way into North Obsidia Ward, you'll find more enemy trainers.

!battle(["Michael", :PSYCHIC_Male, 0])

!battle(["Daniel", :Casanova, 0])

!battle(["Yagami", :EXPERT_Male, 0])

North of here, you'll see a guy selling a single *Link Stone* for $10000. What this does is essentially work as an evolution stone for Pokémon that need to be traded otherwise. To evolve Pokémon that normally trade while holding items, you can give them their item and use the Link Stone on them. This one is pricey, but if you have a Pokémon like Graveler you're trying to evolve, it's worth picking up.

## Defeating the Rival Gang

It's time to help out our friendly gang once more.

### The Magma Gang Route (Part 2)

If you joined Aqua last chapter, [jump to the next section](#the-aqua-gang-route-part-2)

Return to Maxwell in North Obsidia, then head over to the Aqua Gang's hideout in Lapis. Defeat the guards at the entrance.

!battle(["Mannie", :AQUA1, 0], nil, ["Razzy", :AQUA1, 0])

Grab *TM41 Torment* while you're here and prepare for a battle.

!battle(["Archer", :Archer, 0])

This can be a tough fight since his levels are above your cap and he has Drizzle on his side. That said with no Damp Rock Pelipper is the only rain setter, and only for 5 turns, so you can pretty easily use Protect to make it go away and then go to town. His Sharpedo will outspeed you but doesn't hit incredibly hard, while his Blastoise can be tanky but shouldn't be too threatening outside of the rain.

Once you win, the Aqua Gang will retreat. We can actually now access the pond in the back, nothing new though.

!enc(170, ["Fishing"], ["Old"])

Anyways, return to Maxwell at your alleyway to get **Houndour**. That's it with the Magma Gang for another few badges, however.

### The Aqua Gang Route (Part 2)

If you joined Magma last chapter, [jump to the next section](#rock-smash-exploration)

Return to Archer in Lapis, then head over to the Magma Gang's hideout in North Obsidia. Defeat the guards at the entrance.

!battle(["Nihil", :MAGMA1, 0], nil, ["Kriz", :MAGMA1, 0])

Grab *TM46 Thief* as well as a hidden *Red-Hots* while you're here and prepare for a battle.

!battle(["Maxwell", :Maxwell, 0])

This can be a tough fight since his levels are above your cap and he has Drought on his side. As long as Ninetales doesn't switch, there will only be 5 turns of sun, so you can use Protect to make it go away and then go to town. His Houndoom is physical and doesn't hit very hard, while his Charizard is only threatening under the sun.

Once you win, the Magma Gang will retreat. Behind where Maxwell was you can get a hidden *X Attack*.

Anyways, return to Archer at your alleyway to get **Carvanha**. That's it with the Aqua Gang for another few badges, however.

## Rock Smash Exploration

Head over to the Onyx Ward next. Inside one of the rooms upstairs the guy playing "Mr. Mimecraft" will now move. Using the Data Chip we found earlier, we can talk to the PC here for a chance to catch **Porygon**. Next, head to the hallway where the tutors are. Go into the left door - inside you can talk to someone who will tell us a new password: *stopitems*.

In Lapis Ward a lady in the Pokémon Center will tell us about a few more passwords: *leveloffset* and *percentlevel*.

### Smashin' at the Stairway

Head over to the Grand Stairway and make your way to B1F. At the top right, smash a rock, pick up a hidden *Green Shard*, then go up. In this new room you can find a hidden *PP Up*, *Exp. Candy L*, and a stationary *Exp. Candy M*. Talk to the hiker in here for a *Mining Kit*.

The Mining Kit allows us to finally deal with all those glowing rocks everywhere. Essentially we get to play the Gen. IV mining minigame, except the prizes are actually good! Each stone will generate 2-4 items.

Item probabilities are listed [in the appendices](#mining-item-probabilities).

We can't revive the fossils or use the Odd Keystone just yet, but hold onto them if you get them. The evolution stones can help you evolve your team if you manage to find them, and Heart Scales and Shards will be useful throughout the game. The remaining items are generally good hold items, though you can get at least one of each somewhere else in the game as well. There is an incredible number of these glowing rocks throughout the game. I won't be pointing out when there are rocks in a given room, but feel free to break them as you see them.

Back in the main part of B1F, head to the left and smash the rock to go down a ladder. You may find **Solrock** here - this is a randomly determined event. You'll also find a hidden *Red Shard* as well as a *Rare Candy* and an *Amplifield Rock*.

Make your way back to the part with the sequence of ledges on B2F, and take the second path from the left. You'll be able to smash a rock to get an *Exp. Candy M*. Next, head back up and take the rightmost path. Smash some rocks along the path to access a hidden *Exp. Candy M*. Following this path up, you'll find **Lunatone** if you didn't find Solrock earlier.

### Smashin' at the Slums

Next, head to Obsidia Ward. The Sweet Shop has new inventory.

!shop("Sweet Kiss (Bottom) (4 Badges)", ["Common Candy", "Exp. Candy XS", "Exp. Candy S", "Exp. Candy M", "Rare Candy"], [nil, 500, 2000, 5000, nil])

Next, we're going to head on over to the Obsidia Slums. On the first floor of the main area of the slums take the top left escalator down to reach B1F. Then go between the escalators through the door here, and use the Dull Key inside. Grab a hidden *Calcium* then enter the next room.

!enc(320, nil, nil, "Slums Playground Entrance")

Grab the *Super Repel* and hidden *Exp. Candy L* and enter the next room.

!enc(321)

You can find a *Sun Stone* on the floor. The hidden items in this room are *Purple Shard*, *Red Shard*, *Full Heal*, and *Protein*.

You'll need to defeat the two Pangoro on each side of the room and activate the switches beyond them.

!battle(["Don", :PANGORO, 0])

By going to the left side of the room and walking on the floor between the platforms, you can reach the middle of the room.

!battle(["Don", :PANGORO, 1])

Once you've defeated the third in the middle, you will get **Scraggy**! Afterwards you can pick up a *Brave Mint*, *Exp. Candy L*, and hidden *Exp. Candy XL* and *Full Restore*.

Exit this area and make your way to the top right corner of the main room in the slums. Go down the escalator then enter the room on the right side. Down the stairs you can smash some rocks and head in to a new area of the Railnet.

!enc(228, nil, nil, "Underground Railnet (Tracks Area)")

Pick up the *Light Ball* and hidden 2 *Common Candies* and *Red Shard*. You can smash the dark spot on the wallx to access another area. 

!enc(762, nil, nil, "Underground Railnet (Narrow Path)")

Grab the hidden *Hyper Potion*, *Purple Shard*, and *Dusk Ball* as you sneak through this path. Smash the wall on the other side and push the switch here, then go left.

!enc(229, ["Cave"], nil, "Underground Railnet (Depths)")

We don't have Flash yet, so this area can be a bit annoying to search for items and such. In the top right corner you can smash a rock to free a guy. You'll find hidden *X Sp. Atk* and *Rock Gem* nearby. There's also a smash wall above you containing an *Ability Capsule*. Make your way down the stairs to the right. You'll find a hidden *Green Shard*. Go down more stairs and go straight up. Inside a smash wall you can find *TMX8 Flash*... but we don't have the badge to use it yet. Darn.

Anyways, back outside you can find 2 hidden *Purple Shards*, an *Elixir*, and a *Dusk Stone*. Inside another smash wall you can find the *Cave Field Readout*. Before you leave this area though, headbutt the tall iron poles here!

!enc(229, ["Headbutt"], nil, "Underground Railnet (Depths)")

Head all the way back through the railnet and the slums to escape, then go to the Obsidia Ward Pokémon Center. The guy we saved earlier will give us *Department Store Sticker: Aron*. Very nice.

!shop("Department Store 5F (Left)", ["Great Ball", "Super Potion", "Super Repel", "Full Heal", "Poké Doll"])

The first buyable Great Balls and Super Repels? Sign me up.

!shop("Department Store 5F (Right)", ["HP Up", "Protein", "Carbos", "Zinc", "Calcium", "Iron", "Health Wing", "Muscle Wing", "Resist Wing", "Genius Wing", "Clever Wing", "Swift Wing"])

The Power Items downstairs may be more expensive than these consumables, but you can buy them just once and use them infinitely many times. No reason to ever buy here.

### Smashin' at Beryl Cave

Next, make your way all the way back to Beryl Ward. In the graveyard area we can smash some rocks to reach a new cave.

!enc(184)

On 1F, you'll find a hidden *Flying Gem*, *Burn Heal*, *Blue Shard*, and 2 *Ethers*. Head down the ladder.

!enc(185)

On B1F, you'll find a hidden *Green Shard*, *Awakening*, *Great Ball*, and a *Link Stone* in the cage which you'll need to open using a lever in the other. You can also find **Nidorina** in here who will go with you after seeing the Silver Ring. Pick up the *Rock Incense* and continue to the next floor. 

!enc(186)

On B2F, you'll find hidden *Blue Shard*, *Green Shard*, and *Purple Shard*. Exit at the bottom.

Well, we're back in the Rhodochrine Jungle, in a new area this time. You can find hidden *Ultra Ball*, *Bug Gem*, and *Big Mushroom* here, as well as *TM05 Roar*.

On windy days, you can have a battle!

!battle(["Tribe", :Tribe, 0])

Just gotta find a way to hit Shiftry with a Bug move and you'll probably win here. As a reward, you'll get **Nuzleaf** by talking to it.

The totem at the top here also has Pokémon in it. For each Ill-Fated Doll you have (we only have 1) you can fight and catch a Pokémon in the sequence **Baltoy**, **Elgyem**, **Golett**. Which Pokémon this sequence starts at is randomly determined, however. If you make your way all the way back through Beryl Cave to Beryl Ward, then return without an Ill-Fated Doll in your bag on a clear day, you can catch **Natu** on the totem pole.

### Smashin' at Citrine Mountain

Next, we're going to cross Beryl Bridge and smash the rock here, then enter.

!enc(382, ["Cave"])

!img("citrine2f.png")

1. Start by going to the right. You'll find a hidden *Ability Capsule* and in the wall you can get **Amaura** as long as you have an Ice Heal. Head back to the entrance.
2. Go down from the top of the area, grab the hidden *Super Potion* to the right. Head back up.
3. Talk to **Croagunk** down from here, who will join us thanks to the Silver Ring. Get a hidden *Burn Heal* and Backtrack six platforms.
4. Go left. Along this path you'll find *Blue Shard*, *Shoal Salt*, *Protein*, and *Hyper Potion*. It will fork again eventually: go down the left fork. You can find a hidden *Hyper Potion*, *Purple Shard*, and *Shoal Salt*. Also, pick up the *Short-Circuit Field Readout* here. Will be useful soon!
5. Back up at the fork, go right. You'll find another 2 hidden *Shoal Salts*, *Blue Shard*, and *Max Repel*. Enter the cave entrance up from here, and pick up the hidden *Red Shard* as well as the *Exp. Candy M* and *NeverMeltIce* inside. Talk to Smoochum when you're ready.

!battle(["Savage", :BEARTIC, 0], "Icy Field")

This looks like quite the intimidating battle due to the level difference, but it has its default moves. Blizzard will tear you up but it only has 5 PP, so if you can stall those out with the Protect TM and get a Ghost type onto the field to whittle it down with status moves, you're basically set. After winning, you'll get **Smoochum**.

**Relationship Point Choices:**
- Save Smoochum (+2 Blake)

Exit the cave via Escape Rope or backtracking to the top of the previous room.

## Omen Badge

That wraps up all the sidequests for now, so enter the power plant on the east side of the Beryl Bridge near Citrine Mt.

!enc(198)

Enter the two rooms on either side and talk to two monitors within to see four total scenes. Return to the entrance room and go up when you're ready for the gym battle. If you're having a hard time seeing, here's what the side rooms look like:

!img("yureyu.png")

Anyways, talk to the figure straight up from the entrance to the plant when you're ready.

!battle(["Shade", :SHADE, 0], "Short-Circuit Field")

Finally time to take on the Ghost type leader. If you check your field notes for Short-Circuit, you'll notice some of the things that make Shade difficult to fight. Most of his Ghost type moves get a boost on this field as do the Electric type moves on half of his team. He also has near full IV's on his entire team, a rarity for us so far. Gengar is a solid lead that likes to hit really hard or put you to sleep, so you might need to plan ahead with some priority or anti-sleep measures. Doublade and Banette give themselves a bit of bulk with their seeds while Mimikyu's Disguise ability infamously gives it a free turn to get to +2 Attack or revenge kill for free.

That said, there are a lot of fairly reliable ways to beat the Entity. One lies in the typing: if you can't beat him, join him. Your own Ghost type moves will also be boosted by the field, so something like Unburden Drifblim or a fast Banette can work out well here. Past Mimikyu there also isn't really anything that effectively can stop a fast Dark type such as Chlorophyll Shiftry, so you can try to overwhelm him with super-effective damage that way as well. The field will also switch to Factory Field when certain moves like Discharge are used, so if you have a strategy involving Gear Grind or an Electric type core you could probably make that work, though note Rotom likes to change the field back with its own Discharge.

After you win, you'll get the *Omen Badge* as well as *TM65 Shadow Claw*. Our new cap is Lv. 45 and we can use Flash now.
